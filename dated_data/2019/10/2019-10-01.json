    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells hold great potential for drug screening applications. However, their usefulness is limited by the relative immaturity of cells electro-physiological properties as compared to native cardiomyocytes in the adult human heart. In this work, we extend and improve on methodology to address this limitation, building on previously introduced computational procedures which predict drug effects for mature cells based on changes in optical measurements of action potentials and Ca2+ transients made in stem cell derived cardiac microtissues. This methodology quantifies ion channel changes through the inversion of data into a mathematical model, and maps this response to a mature phenotype through the assumption of functional invariance of fundamental intracellular and membrane channels during maturation.\\n\\nHere we utilize an updated action potential model to represent both immature and mature cells, apply an IC50-based model of dose-dependent drug effects, and introduce a continuation-based optimization algorithm for analysis of dose escalation measurements using five drugs with known effects. The improved methodology can identify drug induced changes more efficiently, and quantitate important metrics such as IC50 in line with published values. Consequently, the updated methodology is a step towards employing computational procedures to elucidate drug effects in mature cardiomyocytes for new drugs using stem cell-derived experimental tissues.",

    "abstract": "Retromer, including Vps35, Vps26, and Vps29, is a protein complex responsible for recycling proteins within the endolysosomal pathway. Although implicated in both Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease, our understanding of retromer function in the adult brain remains limited, in part because Vps35 and Vps26 are essential for development. In Drosophila, we find that Vps29 is dispensable for embryogenesis but required for retromer function in aging adults, including for synaptic transmission, survival, and locomotion. Unexpectedly, in Vps29 mutants, Vps35 and Vps26 proteins are normally expressed and associated, but retromer is mislocalized from neuropil to soma with the Rab7 GTPase. Further, Vps29 phenotypes are suppressed by reducing Rab7 or overexpressing the GTPase activating protein, TBC1D5. With aging, retromer insufficiency triggers progressive endolysosomal dysfunction, with ultrastructural evidence of impaired substrate clearance and lysosomal stress. Our results reveal the role of Vps29 in retromer localization and function, highlighting requirements for brain homeostasis in aging.\\n\\nImpact StatementVps29 promotes retromer localization in the adult Drosophila brain, engaging Rab7 and TBC1D5, and its loss triggers age-dependent neuronal impairments in endolysosomal trafficking and synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "The biology of how faces are built and come to differ from one another is complex. Discovering the genes that contribute to differences in facial morphology is one key to untangling this complexity, with important implications for medicine and evolutionary biology. This study maps quantitative trait loci (QTL) for skeletal facial shape using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. The DO is a randomly outcrossed population with high heterozygosity that captures the allelic diversity of eight inbred mouse lines from three subspecies. The study uses a sample of 1147 DO animals (the largest sample yet employed for a shape QTL study in mouse), each characterized by 22 three-dimensional landmarks, 56,885 autosomal and X-chromosome markers, and sex and age classifiers. We identified 37 facial shape QTL across 20 shape principal components (PCs) using a mixed effects regression that accounts for kinship among observations. The QTL include some previously identified intervals as well as new regions that expand the list of potential targets for future experimental study. Three QTL characterized shape associations with size (allometry). Median support interval size was 3.5 Mb. Narrowing additional analysis to QTL for the five largest magnitude shape PCs, we found significant overrepresentation of genes with known roles in growth, skeletal development, and sensory organ development. For most intervals, one or more of these genes lies within 0.25 Mb of the QTLs peak. QTL effect sizes were small, with none explaining more than 0.5% of facial shape variation. Thus, our results are consistent with a model of facial diversity that is influenced by key genes in skeletal and facial development and, simultaneously, is highly polygenic.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe mammalian face is a complex structure serving many functions. We studied the genetic basis for facial skeletal diversity in a large sample of mice from an experimental population designed for the study of complex traits. We quantified the contribution of genetic variation to variation in three-dimensional facial shape across more than 55,000 genetic markers spread throughout the mouse genome. We found 37 genetic regions which are very likely to contribute to differences in facial shape. We then conducted a more detailed analysis of the genetic regions associated with the most variable aspects of facial shape. For these regions, a disproportionately large number of genes are known to be important to growth and to skeletal and facial development. The magnitude of these genetic contributions to differences in facial shape are consistently small. Our results therefore support the notion that facial skeletal diversity is influenced by many genes of small effect, but that some of these small effects may be related to genes that are fundamental to skeletal and facial development.",

Our recent report, which used (SWRxNZB) F1 (SNF1) mouse model of spontaneous lupus, showed a potential link between immune response initiated in the gut mucosa at juvenile age (sex hormone independent) and SLE susceptibility. Here, this mouse model, we show that gut microbiota contributes to a pro-inflammatory immune response in the intestine and autoimmune progression, primarily in females, leading to an associated gender bias. We found that gut microbiota composition in male and female littermates are significantly different only at adult age and depletion of gut microbes causes suppression of autoimmune progression only in females. In agreement, microbiota depletion suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of gut mucosa in both juvenile and adult females. In male SNF1 mice, on the other hand, orchidectomy (castration) caused changes in the composition of gut microbiota and a modest acceleration of autoimmune progression. However, cecum microbiota transplantation studies failed to show superior protection of females from autoimmunity by androgen-influenced gut microbiota. Overall, our work shows that microbiota-dependent pro-inflammatory immune response in the gut mucosa of females initiated at juvenile ages and androgen-dependent protection of males contributes to gender differences in the intestinal immune phenotype and systemic autoimmune progression.",

    "abstract": "Interoceptive feedback transmitted via the vagus nerve plays a vital role in motivation by tuning actions according to physiological needs. Whereas vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reinforces actions and enhances dopamine transmission in animals, motivational effects elicited by VNS in humans are still largely elusive. Here, we applied non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) on the left or the right ear using a randomized cross-over design (vs. sham). During stimulation, 81 healthy participants had to exert effort to earn food or monetary rewards. We reasoned that taVNS enhances motivation and tested whether it does so by increasing prospective benefits (i.e., vigor) or reducing costs of action (i.e., maintenance) compared to sham stimulation. In line with preclinical studies, taVNS generally enhanced invigoration of effort (p = .004, Bayes factor, BF10 = 7.34), whereas stimulation on the left side primarily facilitated vigor for food rewards (left taVNS: Stimulation x Reward Type, p =.003, BF10 = 11.80). In contrast, taVNS did not affect effort maintenance (ps [&ge;] .09, BF10 < 0.52). Critically, during taVNS, vigor declined less steeply with decreases in wanting ({Delta}b = -.046, p = .031) indicating a boost in the drive to work for rewards. Collectively, our results suggest that taVNS enhances reward-seeking by boosting vigor, not effort maintenance and that the side of the stimulation affects generalization beyond food reward. We conclude that taVNS may enhance the pursuit of prospective rewards which may pave new avenues for treatment of motivational deficiencies.",

Pioneering work linked electrophysiology and calcium imaging in vivo with viral GECI expression, albeit in a small number of cells. Here we characterized the spikefluorescence transfer function in vivo of 91 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex in four transgenic mouse lines expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. We found that GCaMP6s cells have spike-triggered fluorescence responses of larger amplitude, lower variability and greater single-spike detectability than GCaMP6f. Mean single-spike detection rates at high spatiotemporal resolution measured in our data was >70% for GCaMP6s and ~40-50% for GCaMP6f (at 5% false positive rate). These rates are estimated to decrease to 25-35% for GCaMP6f under generally used population imaging conditions.

    "abstract": "One of the grand challenges in quantitative cell biology is understanding the precision with which cells assemble and maintain subcellular organelles. A critical property that governs organelle function is its size. Organelle sizes must be flexible enough to allow cells to grow or shrink them as environments demand, yet be maintained within homeostatic limits. Despite identification of numerous molecular factors that regulate organelle sizes we lack insight into the quantitative principles underlying organelle size control. Here we examine organelle sizes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human iPS cells with mathematical theory to show that cells can robustly control average fluctuations in organelle size. By demonstrating that organelle sizes obey a universal scaling relationship we predict theoretically, our framework suggests that organelles grow in random bursts from a limited pool of building blocks. Burst-like growth provides a general biophysical mechanism by which cells can maintain on average reliable yet plastic organelle sizes.",

Upon DNA unwinding by BLM/WRN, RPA directs the DNA2 nuclease to degrade the 5-strand, revealing the 3 overhang needed for recombination. RPA bound to ssDNA also represents a barrier, explaining the need for the motor activity of DNA2 to displace RPA prior to resection. Using ensemble and single molecule biochemistry, we show that phosphorylated CtIP dramatically stimulates the ATP hydrolysis driven motor activity of DNA2. This activation in turn strongly promotes the degradation of RPA-coated ssDNA by DNA2. The domains of CtIP required to stimulate DNA2 are separable from those that regulate the MRN complex. These results establish that CtIP couples both MRE11-dependent short and DNA2-dependent long-range resection, and show how the motor activity of DNA2 promotes resection.

    "abstract": "1The sizes and shapes of tree crowns are of fundamental importance in ecology, yet understanding the forces that determine them remains elusive. A cardinal question facing ecologists is the degree to which general and non-specific versus ecological and context-dependent processes are responsible for shaping tree crowns. Here, we test this question for the first time across diverse tropical ecosystems. Using trees from 20 plots varying in elevation, precipitation, and ecosystem type (savanna-forest transitions) across the paleo- and neo-tropics, we test the relationship between crown dimensions and tree size. By analyzing these scaling relationships across environmental gradients, biogeographic regions, and phylogenetic distance, we extend Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) predictions to include how local selective pressures shape variation in crown dimensions. Across all sites, we find strong agreement between mean trends and MST predictions for the scaling of crown size and shape, but large variation around the mean. While MST explained approximately half of the observed variation in tree crown dimensions, we find that local, ecosystem, and phylogenetic predictors account for the half of the residual variation. Crown scaling does not change significantly across regions, but does change across ecosystem types, where savanna tree crowns grow more quickly with tree size than forest tree crowns. Crowns of legumes were wider and larger than those of other taxa. Thus, while MST can accurately describe the central tendency of tree crown size, local ecological conditions and evolutionary history appear to modify the scaling of crown shape. Importantly, our extension of MST incorporating these differences accounts for the mechanisms driving variation in the scaling of crown dimensions across the tropics. These results are critical when scaling the function of individual trees to larger spatial scales or incorporating the size and shape of tree crowns in global biogeochemical models.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 based method for isolating randomly induced recessive lethal mutations in a gene of interest (GOI) by selection within the F1 progeny of a single genetic cross. Our method takes advantage of the ability to overexpress a GOI using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated activation of gene expression. In essence, the screening strategy is based upon the idea that if overexpression of a wild type allele can generate a phenotype, then overexpression of a newly induced loss-of-function allele will lack this phenotype. As a proof-of-principle, we used this method to select EMS induced mutations of the Drosophila gene hindsight (hnt). From approximately 45,000 F1 progeny we recovered 8 new EMS induced loss-of-function hnt alleles that we characterized as an allelic series of hypomorphic mutations. This new method can, in theory, be used to recover randomly induced point mutants in a GOI and can be applied to any circumstance where CRISPR/Cas9 mediated activation of gene expression is associated with lethality or a visible phenotype.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRepeat expansions in RFC1 and DAB1 have recently been identified as causing cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and spinocerebellar ataxia 37 (SCA37), respectively. We evaluated the prevalence of these repeat-expansions in an undiagnosed ataxia cohort from the United States.\\n\\nMethodsA cohort of 596 patients with undiagnosed familial or sporadic cerebellar ataxia were evaluated at a tertiary referral ataxia center and excluded for common genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia. Patients were then screened for the presence of pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 (AAGGG) and DAB1 (ATTTC) using fluorescent repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR). Two additional undiagnosed ataxia cohorts from different centers, totaling 96 and 13 patients respectively, were subsequently screened for RFC1 resulting in a combined 705 subjects tested.\\n\\nResultsIn the initial cohort, 42 samples were identified with one expanded allele in the RFC1 gene (7.0%), and 9 had two expanded alleles (1.5%). For the additional cohorts, we found 12 heterozygous samples (12.5%) and 7 biallelic samples (7.3%) in the larger cohort, and 1 heterozygous sample (7.7%) and 3 biallelic samples (23%) in the second. In total, 19 patients were identified with biallelic repeat expansions in RFC1 (2.7%). Of these 19 patients, 6 (32%) had a clinical diagnosis of CANVAS, 10 had cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy (53%), and 3 had spinocerebellar ataxia (16%). No patients were identified with expansions in the DAB1 gene.\\n\\nConclusionIn a large undiagnosed ataxia cohort from the United States, biallelic pathogenic repeat expansion in RFC1 was observed in 2.7%. Testing should be strongly considered in ataxia patients, especially those with CANVAS or neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-cell dedifferentiation has been revealed as a pathological mechanism underlying pancreatic dysfunction in diabetes. However, little is known on the genetic and epigenetic changes linked with the dedifferentiation of {beta}-cells. We now report that {beta}-cell dedifferentiation is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) triggered by miR-7-mediated repression of Smarca4/Brg1 expression, a catalytic subunit of the mSwi/Snf chromatin remodeling complexes essential for {beta}-cell transcription factors ({beta}-TFs) activity. miR-7-mediated repression of Brg1 expression in diabetes causes an overall compaction of chromatin structure preventing {beta}-TFs from accessing and transactivating genes maintaining the functional and epithelial identity of {beta}-cells. Concomitantly, loss of {beta}-cell identity impairs the ability of {beta}-TFs Pdx1, Nkx6-1, Neurod1 to repress non-{beta}-cell genes enriched selectively in mesenchymal cells leading to EMT, change in islet microenvironment, and fibrosis. Remarkably, anti-EMT agents normalized glucose tolerance of diabetic mice, thus revealing mesenchymal reprogramming of {beta}-cells as a novel therapeutic target in diabetes. This study sheds light on the genetic signature of dedifferentiated {beta}-cells and highlights how loss of mSwi/Snf activity in diabetes initiating a step-wise remodeling of epigenetic landscapes of {beta}-cells leading to the induction of an EMT process reminiscent of a response to tissue injury.",

    "abstract": "Algae-bacteria associations are increasingly being recognized to be important in shaping the growth of both algae and bacteria. Bacteria belonging to order Rhizobiales are important symbionts of legumes often developing as nodules on plant roots, but have not been widely documented in association with algae. Here, we detected, isolated, and characterized a Rhizobium species from the toxic benthic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus culture. The sequence of 16S rDNA showed 99% identity with that of Rhizobium rosettiformans. To further characterize the bacterium, we amplified and sequenced a cell wall hydrolase (CWH)-encoding gene; phylogenetic analysis indicated that this sequence was similar to the homologs of Martellela sp. and Hoeflea sp, of order Rhizobiales. We performed PCR using nifH primers to determine whether this bacterium can fix N2; however, the results of sequencing analysis showed that it was closer to chlorophyllide a reductase-encoding gene (bchX), which is similar to nifH. Results of 16S rDNA qPCR showed that compared to that in the early exponential phase, the abundance of this bacterium increased during the late exponential growth phase of Gambierdiscus. When the dinoflagellate culture was subjected to N limitation, the abundance of the bacterium represented by both 16S rDNA and CWH increased. Based on these results and published literature, it is apparent that this Rhizobium bacterium benefits from the association with Gambierdiscus by hydrolyzing and utilizing the extracellular organic matter exudates released by the dinoflagellate. This is the first report of Rhizobium species being associated with dinoflagellates, which will shed light on the algae-bacteria relationships.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPhytoplankton are the undisputed primary producers in the aquatic ecosystems and contribute approximately half of the global net primary productivity.\\n\\nDinoflagellates are one of the most important phytoplankton in the marine ecosystems. Commonly, they do not exist autonomously in the marine environment but rather co-live with many bacteria that interact with dinoflagellates, producing a dynamic microbial ecosystem. Their interactions play a major role in important processes such as carbon fluxes and nutrient regeneration in the ocean, ultimately influencing the global carbon cycle and the climate. Hence, there is a need to understand the association and relationships between dinoflagellates and bacteria. Here, we tried to elucidate these interactions through isolating and characterizing a bacterium from a benthic toxic dinoflagellate culture. Our study is the first report of such bacterium being recorded to be associated with a dinoflagellate in this genus, providing new insights into the dinoflagellate-bacteria association for future research.",

    "abstract": "During active multiple sclerosis (MS), red blood cells (RBCs) harvested from patients reportedly display increased osmotic fragility and increased cellular volume (macrocytosis). The cause of these abnormalities remains unknown. We have previously proposed that Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin (ETX) may be a blood-borne trigger for newly forming MS lesions based on its tropism for blood-brain barrier vasculature and CNS myelin. Recently, Gao et al. have reported that ETX binds to and damages human RBCs, leading to hemolysis. Moreover, the authors suggest that purinergic nucleotide (P2) receptor activation amplifies the hemolytic process. Here, we confirm that ETX indeed causes human-specific RBC lysis. However, our data suggest that the hemolytic process is mediated by metal-catalyzed oxidation of the swell-induced, nucleotide-sensitive ICln chloride channel. We use spectrophotometry, flow cytometry and Western blotting to show that ETX targets human RBCs and T lymphocytes via their shared expression of Myelin and Lymphocyte protein (MAL); a protein shown to be both necessary and sufficient for ETX binding and toxicity. ETX likely triggers T cells to release redox-active heavy metals, Cu+ and Fe3+, via the lysosomal exocytosis pathway, while RBCs likely release these heavy metals via ETX pore formation within the RBC membrane. Extracellular Cu+ and Fe3+ may then amplify hemolysis by oxidizing a previously identified heavy metal-binding site within the ICln channel pore, thus deregulating its normal conductance. Elucidating the precise mechanism of ETX-mediated hemolysis may shed light on the underlying etiology of MS, as it would explain why MS RBC abnormalities occur during active disease.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEDuring active MS, numerous reports suggest that circulating RBCs are larger than normal and fragment more easily. The exact trigger(s) for these RBC abnormalities and for newly forming MS lesions remains unidentified. We have proposed that ETX, secreted by the gut bacterium Clostridium perfringens, may be an environmental trigger for newly forming MS lesions. Indeed, ETX has been shown to breakdown the BBB, enter the brain and damage the myelin sheath. Because ETX is typically spread through the circulatory system, we wished to determine how the toxin affects human blood. Provocatively, there has been a recent report that ETX produces cellular abnormalities in human RBCs, reminiscent of what has been described during active MS. In our study, we sought to elucidate the precise mechanism for how ETX causes RBC damage. In addition to triggering BBB breakdown and CNS demyelination, ETX might also explain why RBCs appear abnormal during MS attacks.",

PER2 function is regulated by casein kinase 1 (CK1)-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination but little is known about other PER2 PTMs or their interaction with PER2 phosphorylation. We found that PER2 can be SUMOylated by both SUMO1 and SUMO2; however, SUMO1 versus SUMO2 conjugation had different effects on PER2 turnover and transcriptional suppressor function. SUMO2 conjugation facilitated PER2-{beta}-TrCP interaction leading to PER2 proteasomal degradation. In contrast, SUMO1 conjugation, mediated by E3 SUMO-protein ligase RanBP2, enhanced CK1-mediated PER2S662 phosphorylation and increased PER2 transcriptional suppressor function. PER2 K736 was critical for both SUMO1- and SUMO2-conjugation. A PER2K736R mutation was sufficient to alter circadian periodicity and reduce PER2-mediated transcriptional suppression.

    "abstract": "Acyl homoserine lactone acylases are quorum quenching enzymes that degrade the Gram negative bacterial autoinducer N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) and belong to the Ntn-hydrolases superfamily of enzymes. Recent findings reported AHL acylase activity of pencillin V acylases (PVA) which, alongside bile salt hydrolases, are members of the cholyolglycine hydrolase (CGH) family of the Ntn-hydrolases superfamily. The present study reports the unique activity profile of two CGHs from a marine bacterium Shewanella loihica-PV4, designated here as SlCGH1 and SlCGH2, including the structural analysis of SlCGH1. Both the enzymes exhibit AHL acylase activity while unexpectedly being inactive on standard CGH substrates PenV and bile salts. SlCGH1 differs from known homotetrameric CGHs in being a homodimer displaying a reduced active site volume attributed to loop orientation, which subsequently directs the substrate specificity. Moreover a ligand bound complex structure revealed an unusual bent conformation of the saturated acyl chain bound to the active site and also predicts a single oxyanion hole forming residue during catalysis instead of the usual two residues. Phylogenetic analysis reveals SlCGH1 homologs cluster separate from reported CGHs and AHL acylases. On the whole, SlCGH1 could represent a functionally distinct new sub-class of CGH as an adaptation to the marine environment and its structure could provide the structural framework for understanding such a novel subclass. We also make a modest proposal of a probable evolutionary link between AHL acylases and {beta} lactam acylases based on the overlap in activity and structural features.\\n\\nSignificanceCross-reactivity between AHL acylases and b lactam acylases has been recently identified giving us a vivid glimpse of a possible evolutionary relationship between the phenomena of quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance. We report here the first AHL acylase of the CGH structural framework. SlCGH1 from Shewanella loihica PV-4 is also the first report of a marine CGH with a unique activity and a new structural subclass of CGH family with AHL acylase activity. This finding highlights the vast diversity of AHL acylases and by extension quorum quenching enzymes as adaptation to different habitats. The results from this study also bolster the link between signal molecules and antibiotics, extending our understanding of the inadequately understood physiological roles of b-lactam acylases.",

This capacity is studied in the laboratory through sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However, these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation outside the laboratory. To this end we tested the extent to which a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically compared two groups of young, healthy subjects adapted on the treadmill by moving their feet at different speeds with a split-belt treadmill or with a pair of motorized shoes. We found that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable between groups. We only found small differences in the join angle kinematics during baseline walking between the groups-potentially due to the relatively large weight and height of the motorized shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes, opening the exciting possibility to study sensorimotor adaptation during more realistic situations outside the laboratory.",

Contrary to current models, the majority of parental histones are evicted from the DNA, with histone recycling, nucleosome sliding and replication fork stalling also occurring but at lower frequencies. The anticipated local histone transfer only becomes dominant upon depletion of free histones from extracts.

We find that CDK8 and its paralogue CDK19 are significantly overexpressed in HCC patients, where high levels correlate with poor prognosis. Liver-specific genetic deletion of CDK8 in mice is well supported and protects against chemical carcinogenesis. Deletion of either CDK8 or CDK19 in hepatic precursors had little effect on gene expression in exponential cell growth but prevented oncogene-induced transformation.

    "abstract": "Glucagon is secreted from pancreatic -cells to activate gluconeogenesis and other pathways that raise blood glucose during hypoglycemia. Glucose-dependent regulation of glucagon secretion involves both -cell-intrinsic mechanisms and paracrine control through insulin and somatostatin. In type-2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately high glucagon levels contribute to hyperglycemia. To understand these disease-associated changes at the cellular level, and to isolate intrinsic and paracrine effects, we analyzed glucagon granule exocytosis and membrane excitability in isolated -cells from 56 non-diabetic (ND) and 15 T2D human donors. High resolution imaging showed that glucagon granule exocytosis had a U-shaped sensitivity to glucose, with the slowest rate around 7 mM glucose, and accelerated rates at <5 and >10 mM glucose. Exocytosis was reduced in T2D -cells, but their glucose sensitivity remained intact and there were no changes in voltage-dependent ion currents or granule trafficking. Instead, -cells from T2D donors were markedly insensitive to somatostatin and insulin, which rapidly inhibited exocytosis and electrical activity in ND cells. Thus, intrinsic mechanisms do not inhibit glucagon secretion at hyperglycemia, and elevated glucagon levels in human T2D reflect an insensitivity of -cells to paracrine inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Between the early 16th and late 19th centuries, an estimated 12 million Africans were transported to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave trade. Following Britains abolition of slave trade in 1807, the Royal Navy patrolled the Atlantic and intercepted slave ships that continued to operate. During this period, the island of St Helena in the middle of the South Atlantic served as a depot for \\\"liberated\\\" Africans. Between 1840 and 1867, approximately 27,000 Africans were disembarked on the island. To investigate their origins, we generated genome-wide ancient DNA data for 20 individuals recovered from St Helena. The genetic data indicate that they came from West Central Africa, possibly the area of present-day Gabon and Angola. The data further suggest that they did not belong to a single population, confirming historical reports of cultural heterogeneity among the islands African community. Our results shed new light on the origins of enslaved Africans during the final stages of the slave trade and illustrate how genetic data can be used to complement and validate existing historical sources.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining the epithelial barrier, particularly during early life. Notably, patients with chronic intestinal inflammation have a dysregulated process of renewal and replenishment of the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier, which is linked to disturbances in the gut microbiota. To date, there are no studies focussed on understanding the impact of inflammatory cell shedding events during the early life developmental window, and which host and microbial factors mediate these responses. Here we sought to determine pathological cell shedding outcomes throughout the postnatal developmental period (day 14, 21, 29 and week 8). Surprisingly neonatal mice (day 14 and 21) were highly refractory to induction of cell shedding after intraperitoneal administration of LPS, with day 29 mice showing strong pathological responses, more similar to those observed in adult mice. These differential responses were not linked to defects in the cellular mechanisms and pathways known to regulate cell shedding responses, although we did observe that neonatal mice had elevated anti-inflammatory (IL-10) responses. Notably, when we profiled microbiota and metabolites from these mice, we observed significant alterations. Neonatal mice had high relative abundances of Streptococcus, Escherichia and Enterococcus and increased primary bile acids. In contrast, older mice were dominated by Candidatus Arthromitus, Alistipes and Lachnoclostridium, and had increased concentrations of SCFAs and methyamines. Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) and antibiotic studies confirmed the importance of early life gut microbiota in cell shedding responses. In these studies, neonates treated with antibiotics restored LPS-induced small intestinal cell shedding, whereas adult FMT alone had no effect. Our findings further support the importance of the early life window for microbiota-epithelial interactions in the presence of inflammatory stimuli and highlight areas for further investigation to probe underlying mechanisms to drive therapeutic development within the context of chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Infection and inflammation within the brain induces changes in neuronal connectivity and function. The intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, is one pathogen that infects the brain and can cause encephalitis and seizures. Persistent infection by this parasite is also associated with behavioral alterations and an increased risk for developing psychiatric illness, including schizophrenia. Current evidence from studies in humans and mouse models suggest that both seizures and schizophrenia result from a loss or dysfunction of inhibitory synapses. In line with this, we recently reported that persistent Toxoplasma gondii infection alters the distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), an enzyme that catalyzes GABA synthesis in inhibitory synapses. These changes could reflect a redistribution of presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons or a loss of inhibitory nerve terminals. To directly assess the latter possibility, we employed serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) and quantified inhibitory perisomatic synapses in neocortex and hippocampus following parasitic infection. Not only did persistent infection lead to a significant loss of perisomatic synapses, it induced the ensheathment of neuronal somata by phagocytic cells. Immunohistochemical, genetic, and ultrastructural analyses revealed that these phagocytic cells included reactive microglia. Finally, ultrastructural analysis identified phagocytic cells enveloping perisomatic nerve terminals, suggesting they may participate in synaptic stripping. Thus, these results suggest that microglia contribute to perisomatic inhibitory synapse loss following parasitic infection and offer a novel mechanism as to how persistent Toxoplasma gondii infection may contribute to both seizures and psychiatric illness.\\n\\nMAIN POINTSO_LIToxoplasma-infection leads the loss of perisomatic inhibitory synapses\\nC_LIO_LIPhagocytic microglia ensheath neuronal somata following Toxoplasma-infection\\nC_LIO_LIMicroglia contact and envelop perisomatic nerve terminals, suggesting that Toxoplasma induces synaptic stripping\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers Disease (AD) often exhibit pathological alterations that involve abnormal aggregations of proteins and lipids. Here, we demonstrate that high-resolution, label-free, chemically-specific imaging using Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy (SRS) provides novel insights into the biophysical properties and biochemical composition of such pathological structures. In brain slices of a mouse model of AD, SRS reveals large numbers of Amyloid-{beta} plaques that commonly form a characteristic, three-dimensional core-shell structure, with a fibrillar proteinaceous core surrounded by a halo-like shell of lipid-rich deposits. SRS spectroscopic imaging allows for a clean, label-free visualization of the misfolded ({beta}-sheet) Amyloid-{beta} content in the plaque core. Surrounding lipid-rich deposits are found to contain comparatively high concentrations of membrane lipids (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine), but lower levels of cholesterol than healthy white matter structures. Overall, the SRS spectra of plaque-associated lipids closely resemble those of nearby neurites, with the notable difference of a higher degree of lipid unsaturation compared to healthy brain structures. We hypothesize that plaque-associated lipid deposits may result from neuritic dystrophy associated with AD, and that the observed increased levels of unsaturation could help identify the kinds of pathological alterations taking place. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of Stimulated Raman Scattering microscopy to contribute to a deeper understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Addicted individuals compulsively seek drugs. Cortico-striatal projections have been implicated in persevering to seek rewards even when punished. The temporo-spatial determinants of the activity underlying the compulsive reward seeking however remains elusive. Here we trained mice in a seek-take chain, rewarded by optogenetic dopamine neuron self-stimulation (oDASS). Mice that persevered when seeking was punished, exhibited an increased AMPA/NMDA ratio selectively at orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to dorsal striatum (DS) synapses. In addition, an activity peak of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the DS at the moment of signalled reward availability was detected. Chemogenetic inhibition of OFC neurons curbed the activity peak and reduced punished reward seeking, as did optogenetic hyperpolarization of SPNs time locked to the cue predicting reward availability, establishing a causal link. Taken together, we conclude that the strengthening of OFC-DS synapses drives SPNs activity when a reward predictive cue is delivered, thus encouraging reward seeking in subsequent trials.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with social and communicative disabilities. The cellular and circuit mechanisms by which loss of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) function results in social deficits are unknown. Here, we identify social behavioral dysregulation with loss of Nf1 in Drosophila. These deficits map to primary dysfunction of a small group of peripheral sensory neurons, rather than central brain circuits. Specifically, Nf1 regulation of Ras signaling in adult, Ppk23+ chemosensory cells is required for normal social behaviors in flies. Loss of Nf1 results in attenuated ppk23+ neuronal activity in response to pheromonal cues, and circuit-specific manipulation of Nf1 expression or neuronal activity in ppk23+ neurons rescues social deficits. Unexpectedly, this disrupted sensory processing gives rise to persistent changes in behavior lasting beyond the social interaction, indicating a sustained effect of an acute sensory misperception. Together our data identify a specific circuit mechanism through which Nf1 acts to regulate social behaviors, and suggest social deficits in NF1 arise from propagation of sensory misinformation.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary acini represent the functional gas-exchanging units of the lung. Due to technical limitations, individual acini cannot be identified on microscopic lung sections. To overcome these limitations, we imaged the right lower lobes of instillation-fixed rat lungs from postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 m. Individual acini were segmented from the three-dimensional data by closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas exchanging airways. For a subset of acini (N=268), we followed the acinar development by stereologically assessing their volume and their number of alveoli. We found that the mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed time-frame. The coeffcients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20 % smallest to the 20 % largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points. The acinar volumes show a very large variation early in lung development and homogenize during maturation of the lung by reducing their size distribution by a factor of 7 until adulthood. The homogenization of the acinar sizes hints at an optimization of the gas-exchange region in the lungs of adult animals and that acini of different size are not evenly distributed in the lungs. This likely leads to more homogeneous ventilation at later stages in lung development.",

    "abstract": "The genomic platform that informs evolution of microRNA cascades remains unknown. Here we capitalized on the recent evolutionary trajectory of hominin-specific miRNA-4673 (Dokumcu et al., 2018) encoded in intron 4 of notch-1 to uncover the identity of one such precursor genomic element and the selective forces acting upon it. The miRNA targets genes that regulate Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling cascade. Primary sequence of the microRNA and its target region in Wnt modulating genes evolved from homologous signatures mapped to homotypic cis-clusters recognised by TCF3/4 and TFAP2A/B/C families. Integration of homologous TFAP2A/B/C cis-clusters (short range inhibitor of {beta}-catenin (Li and Dashwood, 2004)) into the transcriptional landscape of Wnt cascade genes can reduce noise in gene expression (Blake et al., 2003). Probabilistic adoption of miRNA secondary structure by one such cis-signature in notch-1 reflected selection for superhelical curvature symmetry of precursor DNA to localize a nucleosome that overlapped the latter cis-cluster. By replicating the cis-cluster signature, non-random interactions of the miRNA with key Wnt modulator genes expanded the transcriptional noise buffering capacity via a coherent feed-forward loop mechanism (Hornstein and Shomron, 2006). In consequence, an autonomous transcriptional noise dampener (the cis-cluster/nucleosome) evolved into a post-transcriptional one (the miRNA). The findings suggest a latent potential for remodelling of transcriptional landscape by miRNAs that capitalize on non-random distribution of genomic cis-signatures.",

This platform, the CellWell, is constructed out of a thin, optically transparent substrate that is lithographically micropatterned with a network of wells sized to fit individual cells. The substrate material consists of a thin layer of agarose hydrogel embedded with polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers. The geometries of the wells are designed to reinforce a physiological morphology, thereby combining the physiological advantages of 3D culture systems with the practical advantages of 2D systems. CellWells were found to have compressive moduli of 144 {+/-} 11.5 kPa and 158 {+/-} 0.6 kPa at strain rates of 5 m/s and 15 m/s. The compressive moduli were determined at two different strain rates to allow for comparison of CellWell stiffness with published values of pericellular matrix and with observed values of articular cartilage, which could not be indented at the same rate. Articular chondrocytes seeded in a CellWell were found to maintain their spheroidal morphology more effectively than those seeded in monolayer cultures and to be more easily imaged than those seeded in a 3D scaffold of identical thickness. Through its ease of use and ability to maintain the physiological morphology of chondrocytes, we expect that the CellWell will enhance the clinical translatability of future studies conducted using this culture platform.",

The structures reveal a twist of the D-ring, which lead to partial detachment of the chromophore from the protein. Unexpectedly, the conserved so-called pyrrole water is photodissociated from the chromophore, concomitant with movement of the A-ring and a key signalling aspartate.

We predicted population differences in the minimum stimulatory day length to elicit a response (CPP, critical photoperiod) and co-variation between CPP and distance migrated. We found clear population differences in CPP and greater CPP in longer distance migrants. We conclude that current geographic variation in reproductive timing has a genetic or early developmental basis and recommend that future research focus on how anthropogenic changes will interact with CPP to adjust timing of reproduction and migration.",

Using phylo-transcriptomics from 74 taxa and genome survey sequencing for 66 of those taxa, we infer nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies to assess relationships among the major families of the Brassicales and within the Brassicaceae. We then use multiple methods of WGD inference to assess placement of WGD events. We not only present well-supported chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies for the Brassicales, but we also putatively place Th- and provide evidence for previously unknown events, including one shared by at least two members of the Resedaceae, which we name Rs-.

    "abstract": "Linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (LREfs) carrying optrA are increasingly reported globally from multiple sources, but we still lack a comprehensive analysis of human and animal optrA-LREfs strains. We investigated the phylogenetic structure, genetic content [antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence, prophages, plasmidome] and optrA-containing platforms of 28 publicly available optrA-positive E. faecalis genomes from different hosts in 7 countries. In the genome-level analysis, in house databases with 57 virulence and 391 plasmid replication genes were tested for the first time. Our analysis showed a diversity of clones and adaptive gene sequences related to a wide range of genera, mainly but not exclusive from Firmicutes. The content in AMR and virulence genes was highly identical in contrast to the diversity of phages and plasmids observed. Epidemiologically unrelated clones (ST476-like and ST21-like) obtained from human clinical and animal hosts in different continents over 5 years (2012-2017) were phylogenetically related (3-122 SNPs difference). They also exhibited identical AMR and virulence profiles, highlighting a global spread of optrA-positive strains with relevant adaptive traits in livestock and that they might originate from an animal reservoir. optrA was located on the chromosome within a Tn6674-like element (n=9) or on medium-size plasmids (30-60 kb; n=14) belonging to main plasmid families (RepA_N/Inc18/Rep_3). In most cases, the immediate gene vicinity of optrA was identical in chromosomal (Tn6674) and plasmid (impB-fexA-optrA) backbones. Tn6674 was always inserted in the same {Delta}radC integration site and embedded in a 32 kb chromosomal platform common to diverse strains from different origins (patients, healthy humans, and animals) in Europe, Africa, and Asia during 2012-2018. This platform is conserved among hundreds of E. faecalis genomes and we here propose a conserved chromosomal hotspot for optrA integration. The finding of optrA in strains sharing identical adaptive features and genetic backgrounds across different hosts and countries suggest the occurrence of common and independent genetic events occurring in distant regions, and might explain the easy de novo generation of optrA-positive strains. It also anticipates a dramatic increase of optrA carriage and spread with a serious impact in the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.",

    "abstract": "The Cpx response is one of several envelope stress responses that monitor and maintain the integrity of the gram-negative bacterial envelope. While several conditions that are known or predicted to generate misfolded inner membrane proteins activate the Cpx response, the molecular nature of the Cpx inducing cue is not yet known. Studies have demonstrated that mutation of multidrug efflux pumps activates the Cpx response in many gram-negative bacteria. In Vibrio cholerae, pathway activation is due to accumulation of the catechol siderophore vibriobactin. However, the mechanism by which the Cpx response is activated by mutation of efflux pumps in Escherichia coli remains unknown. Here we show that inhibition of efflux by deletion of tolC, the outer membrane channel of several multidrug efflux pumps, activates the Cpx response in E. coli as a result of impaired efflux of the siderophore enterobactin. Enterobactin accumulation in the tolC mutant reduces activity of the NADH oxidation arm of the aerobic respiratory chain. However, NADH dehydrogenase I, NADH dehydrogenase II, and cytochrome bo3 do not contribute to Cpx pathway activation in the E. coli tolC mutant. We show that the Cpx response down-regulates transcription of the enterobactin biosynthesis operon. These results suggest that the Cpx response promotes adaptation to envelope stress in enteric bacteria that are exposed to iron-limited environments, which are rich in envelope-damaging compounds and conditions.",

    "abstract": "1.Polydnaviruses are dsDNA viruses associated with endoparasitoid wasps. Delivery of the virus during parasitization of a caterpillar and subsequent virus gene expression is required for production of an amenable environment for parasitoid offspring development. Consequently, understanding of Polydnavirus gene function provides insight into mechanisms of host susceptibility and parasitoid wasp host range. Polydnavirus genes predominantly are arranged in multimember gene families, one of which is the vinnexins, which are virus homologues of insect gap junction genes, the innexins. Previous studies of Campoletis sonorensis Ichnovirus Vinnexins using various heterologous systems have suggested the four encoded members may provide different functionality in the infected caterpillar host. Here, we expressed two of the members, vnxG and vnxQ2, using recombinant baculoviruses in susceptible host, the caterpillar Heliothis virescens. Following intrahemocoelic injections, we observed >90% of hemocytes (blood cells) were infected, producing recombinant protein. Larvae infected with a vinnexin-recombinant baculovirus exhibited significantly reduced molting rates relative to larvae infected with a control recombinant baculovirus and mock infected larvae. Similarly, larvae infected with vinnexin-recombinant baculoviruses were less likely to molt relative to controls, and showed reduced ability to encapsulate chromatography beads in an immune assay. In most assays, the VnxG protein was associated with more severe pathology than VnxQ2. These results, in light of previous findings, support that Polydnavirus Vinnexin gene family members may provide complementary, rather than redundant, effects. This in turn indicates a need to test gene family member functionality across infected hosts for effects to determine member contribution to host range.\n\n2. ImportancePolydnaviruses are obligate mutualistic associates of highly speciose wasp taxa that parasitize caterpillars. Expression of Polydnavirus-encoded genes in hosts parasitized by wasps is necessary for successful parasitization, and an unusual genome structure including multiple-membered gene families is hypothesized to contribute to host manipulation. We have tested this hypothesis by in vivo expression of two members of a family of Polydnavirus homologues of Innexins, or insect gap junction proteins. Previous findings demonstrated that the two Vinnexins induce different physiological alterations in heterologous systems. Here, in host caterpillars, we observed differential alteration by the two proteins of host immune cell (hemocyte) bioelectrical physiology and the immune response of encapsulation. Not only do our data suggest a linkage between cellular bioelectricity and immunity in insects, but they support that gene family expansion has functional consequences to both Polydnavirus and host wasp success.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theory predicts that clonal organisms are more susceptible to extinction than sexually reproducing organisms, due to low genetic variation and slow rates of evolution. In agreement, conservation management considers genetic variation as the ultimate measure of a populations ability to survive over time. However, clonal plants are among the oldest living organisms on our planet. Here, we test the hypothesis that clonal seagrass meadows display epigenetic variation that complements genetic variation as a source of phenotypic variation. In a clonal meadow of the seagrass Zostera marina we characterized DNA methylation among 42 shoots. We also sequenced the whole genome of 10 shoots to correlate methylation patterns with photosynthetic performance under exposure to, and recovery from 27{degrees}C, while controlling for somatic mutations. Here, we show for the first time that clonal seagrass shoots display DNA methylation variation that is associated with variation in fitness-related traits: photosynthetic performance and heat stress resilience. The co-variation in DNA methylation and phenotype may be linked via gene expression because methylation patterns varied in functionally relevant genes involved in photosynthesis, and in the repair and prevention of heat-induced protein damage. A >five week epigenetic heat stress memory may heat-harden previously heat-exposed shoots. While genotypic diversity has been shown to enhance stress resilience in seagrass meadows, we suggest that epigenetic variation plays a similar role in meadows dominated by a single genotype. Consequently, conservation management of clonal plants should consider epigenetic variation as indicator of resilience and stability, and restoration efforts may benefit from stress-priming transplanted seeds or shoots.",

    "abstract": "The aged hematopoietic system is characterized by decreased immuno-competence and by a reduced number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that actively generates new blood cell (age-related clonal hematopoiesis, ARCH). While both aspects are commonly associated with an increased risk of aging-related diseases, it is currently unknown to what extent these aspects co-occur during exceptional longevity. Here, we investigated these aspects in blood cells of an immuno-hematopoietically normal female who reached 111 years. Blood samples were collected across a 9-year period at ages 103, 110 and 111 years. We applied several genetic sequencing approaches to investigate clonality in peripheral blood samples and sorted cell subsets. Immuno-competence was characterized using flow cytometry, T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assays, and in vitro proliferation assays. We identified a single DNMT3A-mutated HSC clone with a complex subclonal architecture and observed ongoing subclonal dynamics within the 9-year timeframe of our sampling. The mutated HSC generated 78-87% myeloid cells, 6-7% of the B-cells, 6% of CD8+ T-cells, and notably 22% of the CD4+ T-cells. Intriguingly, we found that T-cells were capable of robust proliferation when challenged in vitro. Moreover, we observed a surprisingly high TREC content, indicative of recent generation of naive T-cells. Concluding, we observed long-term stability of extreme ARCH with ongoing clonal dynamics combined with functional T-cell immunity. Our results indicate that extreme ARCH does not compromise immuno-competence and that a clonally expanded CD4+ T-cell subset may serve as a potential hallmark of the supercentenarian immune system.\n\nKey pointsO_LILongitudinal blood sampling from a female aged 103-111 revealed a dynamic clonal hematopoiesis contributing to myeloid and lymphoid subsets\nC_LIO_LIDespite the highly advanced age and extreme clonal hematopoiesis we observed functional T-cell immunity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Most mutations in human cancer are low-frequency missense mutations, whose functional status remains hard to predict. Here we show that depending on the type of nucleotide change and the surrounding sequences, the tendency to generate each type of nucleotide mutations varies greatly, even by several hundred folds. Therefore, a cancer-promoting mutation may appear only in a small number of cancer cases, if the underlying nucleotide change is too difficult to generate. We propose a method that integrates both the original mutation counts and their relative mutational difficulty. Using this method, we can accurately predict the functionality of hundreds of low-frequency missense mutations in p53, PTEN and INK4A. Many loss-of-function p53 mutations with dominant negative effects were identified, and the functional importance of several regions in p53 structure were highlighted by this analysis. Furthermore, mutational difficulty analysis also points to potential means of cancer prevention. Our study not only established relative mutational difficulties for different types of mutations in human cancer, but also showed that by incorporating such parameter, we can bring new angles to understanding cancer formation and prevention.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a heterogenous cellular milieu that can influence cancer cell behavior. The characteristics of the cellular TME have a dramatic impact on treatments such as immunotherapy. These features can be revealed with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We hypothesized that single cell gene expression studies of gastric cancer (GC) together with paired normal tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) would identify critical elements of cellular dysregulation not apparent with other approaches.\\n\\nMethodsSingle cell gene expression studies were conducted on seven patients with GC and one patient with intestinal metaplasia. We sequenced 56,167 cells comprising GC (32,407 cells), paired normal tissue (18,657 cells) and PBMCs (5,103 cells). Protein expression of genes of interest was validated by multiplex immunofluorescence.\\n\\nResultsTumor epithelium had copy number alterations and a distinct gene expression program compared to normal with intra-tumor heterogeneity. The GC TME was significantly enriched for stromal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and Tregs. TME-exclusive stromal cells expressed extracellular matrix components distinct from normal tissue. Macrophages were transcriptionally heterogenous and did not conform to a binary M1/M2 paradigm. Gene expression program of tumor DCs was unique from PBMC DCs. TME-specific cytotoxic T cells comprised of two exhausted heterogenous subsets. Helper, cytotoxic T, Treg and NK cells expressed multiple immune checkpoint or costimulatory molecules. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed TME-exclusive inter-cellular communication.\\n\\nConclusionsSingle cell gene expression studies revealed widespread reprogramming across multiple cellular elements in the milieu of the GC TME. Cellular remodeling was delineated by changes in cell numbers, transcriptional states and inter-cellular interactions. This characterization facilitates understanding of tumor biology and enables the identification of novel molecular targets including for cancer immunotherapy.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEWe leveraged the power of single-cell genomics to characterize the heterogenous cell types and states in the tumor microenvironment (TME). By profiling thousands of single cells from surgical resections of gastric cancer together with paired normal mucosa and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we determined the deviations in the TME from physiological conditions. Our analysis revealed a cellular reprogramming of the TME compared to normal mucosa in immune and stromal lineages. We detected transcriptional heterogeneity within macrophages and a TME-specific gene expression program in dendritic cells. Cytotoxic T cells in the TME had heterogenous profiles of exhaustion and expression of multiple immune checkpoint and costimulatory molecules. We constructed a receptor-ligand based inter-cellular communications network that was exclusive to tumor tissue. These discoveries provide information at a highly granular cellular resolution enabling advances in cancer biology, biomarker discovery and identification of treatment targets such as for immunotherapy.",

Here, we identify the AtaC protein as a new type of c-di-AMP-specific phosphodiesterase that is also conserved in pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AtaC is monomeric in solution and binds Mn2+ to specifically hydrolyze c-di-AMP to AMP via the intermediate 5-pApA. As an effector of c-di-AMP signaling, we characterize the RCK-domain protein CpeA as the first c-di-AMP-binding protein to be identified in Streptomyces. CpeA interacts with the predicted cation / proton antiporter, CpeB, linking c-di-AMP signaling to ion homeostasis in actinobacteria. Hydrolysis of c-di-AMP is critical for normal growth and differentiation in Streptomyces, connecting osmotic stress to development. Thus, we present the discovery of two novel components of c-di-AMP signaling in bacteria and show that precise control of this second messenger is essential for osmoregulation and coordinated development in Streptomyces.",

    "abstract": "Airway infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) are polymicrobial. We reported previously that clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa promote the growth of a variety of streptococcal species. To explore the mechanistic basis of this interaction, we performed a genetic screen to identify mutants of Streptococcus sanginuis SK36 whose growth was no longer enhanced by P. aeruginosa PAO1. Mutations in zinc uptake systems of S. sanginuis SK36 reduced growth of these strains by 1-3 log compared to wild-type S. sanginuis SK36 when grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa PA01, while exogenous zinc (0.1-10 m) rescued the coculture defect of zinc uptake mutants of S. sanginuis SK36. Zinc uptake mutants of S. sanginuis SK36 had no obvious growth defect in monoculture. Consistent with a competition for zinc driving coculture dynamics, S. sanginuis SK36 grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa showed increased expression of zinc uptake genes compared to S. sanginuis grown alone. Strains of P. aeruginosa PAO1 defective in zinc transport also supported more robust growth by S. sanginuis compared to coculture with wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1. An analysis of 118 CF sputum samples revealed that total zinc levels varied from ~5-145 M. At relatively low zinc levels, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were found in approximately equal abundance; at higher zinc levels, we observed an increasing relative abundance of Pseudomonas and decline of Streptococcus, perhaps as a result of increasing zinc toxicity. Together, our data indicate that the relative abundance of these microbes in the CF airway may be impacted by zinc levels.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPolymicrobial infections in CF likely impact patient health, but the mechanism(s) underlying such interactions are poorly understood. Here we show that interactions between Pseudomonas and Streptococcus are modulated by zinc availability using an in vitro model system, and clinical data are consistent with this model. Together with previous studies, our work supports a role for metal homeostasis as a key factor driving microbial interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cheese lacks essential fatty acids (EFAs). Delta 12 fatty acid desaturase (FADS12) is a critical enzyme required for EFA biosynthesis in fermentation of the predominant strains of cheese. Previously, we identified the FADS12 gene and characterized its function for the first time in Geotrichum candidum, a dominant strain used to manufacture soft cheese with white rind. In this study, we analyzed the molecular mechanism of FADS12 function by swapping domains from Mortierella alpina and G. candidum that had, respectively, high and low oleic acid conversion rates. The results revealed three regions that are essential to this process, including regions from the end of the second transmembrane domain to the beginning of the third transmembrane domain, from the end of the third transmembrane domain to the beginning of the fourth transmembrane domain, and from the 30-amino acid from the end of the sixth transmembrane domain to the C-terminal end region. Based on our domain swapping analyses, nine pairs of amino acids including H112, S118, H156, Q161, K301, R306, E307, A309 and S323 in MaFADS12 (K123, A129, N167, M172, T302, D307, I308, E310 and D324 in GcFADS12) were identified as having a significantly effect on FADS12 catalytic efficiency, and linoleic acid and its analogues (12,13-cyclopropenoid fatty acid) were found to inhibit the catalytic activity of FADS12 and related recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of FADS12 inhibition was analyzed. The results revealed two allosteric domains, including one domain from the N-terminal region to the beginning of the first transmembrane domain and another from the 31st amino acid from the end of the sixth transmembrane domain to the C terminus. Y4 and F398 amino acid residues from MaFADS12 and eight pairs of amino acids including G56, L60, L344, G10, Q13, S24, K326 and L344 in MaFADS12 (while Y66, F70, F345, F20, Y23, Y34, F327 and F345 in GcFADS12) played a pivotal role in FADS12 inhibition. Finally, we found that both allosteric and active sites were responsible for the catalytic activity of FADS12 at various temperatures, pH, and times. This study offers a solid theoretical basis to develop preconditioning methods to increase the rate at which GcFADS12 converts oleic and linoleic acids to produce higher levels of EFAs in cheese.",

Recent evidence suggests that the nature of this representation is somewhat predictive and can be modelled by learning a successor representation (SR) between distinct positions in an environment. However, this discretisation of space is subjective making it difficult to formulate predictions about how some environmental manipulations should impact the hippocampal representation. Here we present a model of place and grid cell firing as a consequence of learning a SR from a basis set of known neurobiological features - boundary vector cells (BVCs). The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low-dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC-SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the diversity and function of adipose tissue nerves due, in part, to the inability to effectively visualize the various nerve subtypes residing within these tissues. The tools currently available for researchers to image and quantify adipose tissue innervation are limited and dependent on optical clearing techniques and light sheet microscopy. Here we present a method of tissue processing that uses mechanical force to compress tissue to decrease tissue thickness in the z-axis by expanding it in the x and y-axes whilst leaving cells intact. This has been combined with autofluorescence quenching techniques to permit intact whole tissues to be mounted on slides and imaged on any microscope, with a complementary means to perform whole tissue neurite density quantification. We have included examples of how this technique can be used to further our current knowledge of adipose-nerve communication by characterizing the nerves, nerve-subtypes, and neurovascular interactions within subcutaneous white adipose tissue in mice.",

    "abstract": "Reducing neuronal size results in less cell membrane and therefore lower input conductance. Smaller neurons are thus more excitable as seen in their voltage responses to current injections in the soma. However, the impact of a neurons size and shape on its voltage responses to synaptic activation in dendrites is much less understood. Here we use analytical cable theory to predict voltage responses to distributed synaptic inputs and show that these are entirely independent of dendritic length. For a given synaptic density, a neurons response depends only on the average dendritic diameter and its intrinsic conductivity. These results remain true for the entire range of possible dendritic morphologies irrespective of any particular arborisation complexity. Also, spiking models result in morphology invariant numbers of action potentials that encode the percentage of active synapses. Interestingly, in contrast to spike rate, spike times do depend on dendrite morphology. In summary, a neurons excitability in response to synaptic inputs is not affected by total dendrite length. It rather provides a homeostatic input-output relation that specialised synapse distributions, local non-linearities in the dendrites and synaptic plasticity can modulate. Our work reveals a new fundamental principle of dendritic constancy that has consequences for the overall computation in neural circuits.\\n\\nIn briefWe show that realistic neuron models essentially collapse to point neurons when stimulated by randomly distributed inputs instead of by single synapses or current injection in the soma.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA simple equation that predicts voltage in response to distributed synaptic inputs.\\nC_LIO_LIResponses to distributed and clustered inputs are largely independent of dendritic length.\\nC_LIO_LISpike rates in various Hodgkin Huxley (HH) like or Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) models are largely independent of morphology.\\nC_LIO_LIPrecise spike timing (firing pattern) depends on dendritic morphology.\\nC_LIO_LINeuroMorpho.Org database-wide analysis of the relation between dendritic morphology and electrophysiology.\\nC_LIO_LIOur equations set precise input-output relations in realistic dendrite models.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The repeated use of navigation assistance systems leads to decreased processing of the environment. Previous studies demonstrated that auditory augmentation of landmarks in navigation instructions can improve incidental spatial knowledge acquisition when driving a single route through an unfamiliar virtual environment. Based on these results, three experiments were conducted to investigate the generalizability and ecological validity of incidental spatial knowledge acquisition by landmark augmentation in navigation instructions.\n\nIn the first experiment, spatial knowledge acquisition was tested after watching an interactive video showing the navigation of a real-world urban route. A second experiment investigated incidental spatial knowledge acquisition during assisted navigation when participants walked through the same real-world, urban environment. The third experiment tested the acquired spatial knowledge two weeks after an assisted pedestrian navigation phase through the real-world.\n\nAll experiments demonstrated better performance in a cued-recall task for participants navigating with landmark-based navigation instructions as compared to standard instructions. Different levels of information provided with landmark-based instructions impacted landmark recognition dependent on the delay between navigation and test. The results replicated an improved landmark and route knowledge when using landmark-based navigation instructions emphasizing that auditory landmark augmentation enhances incidental spatial knowledge acquisition, and that this enhancement can be generalized to real-life settings.\n\nThis research is paving the way for navigation assistants that, instead of impairing spatial knowledge acquisition, incidentally foster the acquisition of landmark and route knowledge during every-day navigation.",

Conventional imaging diagnostic modalities encounter serious difficulties in correction of artificial motions, associated with the rapid structural variations and fast high dynamics of the intensity values in the collected image sequences, when a common reference cannot be provided. In current report, we introduce an alternative solution that utilizes a Fourier Kappa-Omega filtering approach.

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a key ecological process, but remains difficult to measure. By recording numbers of dispersed individuals at different distances from the source one can acquire a dispersal gradient. Although dispersal gradients contain information on dispersal, they are influenced by the spatial extent of the source. How can we separate the two contributions to extract knowledge on dispersal?\n\nOne could use a small, point-like source for which a dispersal gradient represents a dispersal kernel, which quantifies the probability of an individual dispersal event from a source to a destination point. However, the validity of this approximation cannot be established before conducting measurements.\n\nWe formulated a theory that incorporates the spatial extent of sources to estimate dispersal kernels from dispersal gradients. We re-analyzed published dispersal gradients for three major plant pathogens. We also demonstrated using simulations that this approach provides more accurate estimates of dispersal kernels across biologically plausible scenarios. We concluded that the three plant pathogens disperse over substantially shorter distances compared to conventional estimates. Using this method, a significant proportion of published dispersal gradients can be re-analyzed to improve our knowledge about spatial scales of dispersal. Thus, our results can boost progress in characterization of dispersal across taxa.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAdaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) offers the possibility of identifying and tracking B cell clonal expansions during adaptive immune responses. Members of a B cell clone are descended from a common ancestor and share the same initial V(D)J rearrangement, but their B cell receptore (BCR) sequence may differ due to the accumulation of somatic hypermutations (SHMs). Clonal relationships are learned from AIRR-seq data by analyzing the BCR sequence, with the most common methods focused on the highly diverse junction region. However, clonally related cells often share SHMs which have been accumulated during affinity maturation. Here, we investigate whether shared SHMs in the V and J segments of the BCR can be leveraged along with the junction sequence to improve the ability to identify clonally related sequences. We develop independent distance functions that capture junction similarity and shared mutations, and combine these in a spectral clustering framework to infer the BCR clonal relationships. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that this model improves both the sensitivity and specificity for identifying B cell clones.\n\nAvailabilitySource code for this method is freely available in the SCOPer (Spectral Clustering for clOne Partitioning) R package (version 0.2 or later) in the Immcantation framework: www.immcantation.org under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.\n\nContactsteven.kleinstein@yale.edu",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorder is associated with disruptions in circadian rhythms. The circadian transcription factor neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is enriched in reward-related brain regions and regulates reward, but its role in substance use is unclear. To examine the role of NPAS2 in drug taking, we measured intravenous cocaine self-administration (acquisition, dose-response, progressive ratio, extinction, cue-induced reinstatement) in wild-type (WT) and Npas2 mutant mice at different times of day. In the light (inactive) phase, cocaine reinforcement was increased in all Npas2 mutants, while self-administration and motivation were affected sex-dependently. These sex differences were amplified during the dark (active) phase with Npas2 mutation increasing self-administration, reinforcement, motivation, extinction responding and reinstatement in females, but only reinforcement in males. To determine whether circulating hormones are driving these sex differences, we ovariectomized WT and Npas2 mutant females and confirmed that unlike sham controls, ovariectomized mutant mice showed no increase in self-administration. To identify whether striatal brain regions are activated in Npas2 mutant females, we measured cocaine-induced {Delta}FosB expression. Relative to WT, {Delta}FosB expression was increased in D1+ neurons in the nucleus accumbens core and dorsolateral striatum in Npas2 mutant females after dark phase self-administration. We also identified potential target genes that may underlie the behavioral responses to cocaine in Npas2 mutant females. These results suggest NPAS2 regulates reward and activity in specific striatal regions in a sex and time of day specific manner. Striatal activation could be augmented by circulating sex hormones, leading to an increased effect of Npas2 mutation in females.\n\nSignificance StatementCircadian disruptions are a common symptom of substance use disorders and chronic exposure to drugs of abuse alters circadian rhythms, which may contribute to subsequent substance use. Diurnal rhythms are commonly found in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse with drug sensitivity and motivation peaking during the dark (active) phase in nocturnal rodents. Emerging evidence links disrupted circadian genes to substance use vulnerability and drug-induced alterations to these genes may augment drug-seeking. The circadian transcription factor NPAS2 is enriched in reward-related brain regions and regulates reward, but its role in substance use is unclear. To examine the role of NPAS2 in drug taking, we measured intravenous cocaine self-administration in wild-type and Npas2 mutant mice at different times of day.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing has identified many amplified genes in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC); however, their roles and the clinical relevance have yet elucidated. Here we show TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is a major player in ESCC progression and chemoresistance. TIGAR reprograms glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the glutamine pathway through AMP-activated kinase, and its overexpression is correlated with poor disease outcomes. Tigar knockout mice have reduced ESCC growth and tumor burden. Treatment of TIGAR-overexpressed ESCC cell xenografts and patient-derived tumor xenografts in mice with combination of glutaminase inhibitor and chemotherapeutic agents achieves significant more efficacy than chemotherapy alone. These findings shed light on an important role of TIGAR in ESCC and provide evidence for targeted treatment of TIGAR-overexpressed ESCC.\\n\\nSignificanceEffective and target therapies are required for ESCC, one of the most common types of digestive OR cancer. Little has been known about the biology of ESCC progression or potential molecular targets OR for treatment. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing studies in ESCC have identified OR many recurrent copy number gain genes; however, the roles and druggable relevance of these OR genes remains poorly understood. Herein we demonstrate that TIGAR overexpression leads to OR metabolic remodeling, promoting ESCC progression and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. OR Inhibiting the glutamine pathway significantly represses TIGAR-overexpressing ESCC growth and OR enhances tumor cell sensitization to cytotoxic agents. These findings might provide the rationale OR for clinical trials testing glutamine pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in OR TIGAR-expressing ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genotyping methods can generate numerous genetic markers in a single experiment and have contributed to plant genetic mapping. However, the benefits of NGS-based methods are limited in autopolyploids as their genetic segregation mode is complex. Moreover, autopolyploids have large genomes and require abundant sequencing data to obtain sufficient genetic markers. There are several methods for genetic mapping in autopolyploids. These approaches may be impractical for plant genetic studies as they require large amounts of data and are not cost-effective. In the present study, we propose a simple strategy for genetic mapping of polyploids in a cost-effective manner. The allele dosage probabilities calculated from NGS read counts were used in association analyses to detect loci associated with specific phenotypes. This approach is superior to conventional methods of determining allele dosage, which usually result in the filtering of many genetic markers with low read depth. The validity of the strategy was demonstrated using real phenotype data from autohexaploid sweet potato populations to detect genetic loci for both qualitative and quantitative traits, the latter of which required the use of allele dosage probabilities for the detection of loci. We demonstrate that this proposed method is useful with reasonable NGS read counts.",

    "abstract": "Sparse population activity is a hallmark of supra-granular sensory neurons in neocortex. The mechanisms underlying sparseness are not well understood because a direct link between the neurons activated in vivo and their cellular properties investigated in vitro has been missing. We used two-photon calcium imaging to identify a subset of neurons in layer L2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary somatosensory cortex that are highly active following principal whisker vibrotactile stimulation. These high responders were then tagged using photoconvertible green fluorescent protein for subsequent targeting in the brain slice using intracellular patch-clamp recordings and biocytin staining. This approach allowed us to investigate the structural and functional properties of high responders that distinguish them from less active control cells. Compared to less responsive L2/3 neurons, high responders displayed increased levels of stimulus-evoked and spontaneous activity, elevated noise and spontaneous pair-wise correlations, and stronger coupling to the population response. Intrinsic excitability was reduced in high responders, while other electrophysiological and morphological parameters were unchanged. Thus, the choice of which neurons participate in stimulus encoding may largely be determined by network connectivity rather than by cellular structure and function.",

Here, we develop an optogenetic TDP-43 variant (opTDP-43), whose multimerization status can be modulated in vivo through external light illumination. Using the translucent zebrafish neuromuscular system, we demonstrate that short-term light stimulation reversibly induces cytoplasmic opTDP-43 mislocalization, but not aggregation, in the spinal motor neuron, leading to an axon outgrowth defect associated with myofiber denervation. In contrast, opTDP-43 forms pathological aggregates in the cytoplasm after longer-term illumination and seeds non-optogenetic TDP-43 aggregation. Furthermore, we find that an ALS-linked mutation in the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) exacerbates the light-dependent opTDP-43 toxicity on locomotor behavior. Together, our results propose that IDR-mediated TDP-43 oligomerization triggers both acute and long-term pathologies of motor neurons, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis and progression of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Cotton Verticillium wilt (VW) is a devastating disease seriously affecting fiber yield and quality, and the most effective and economical prevention measure at present is selection and extension of Gossypium varieties harboring high resistant VW. However, multiple attempts to improve the VW resistance of the most widely cultivated Upland cotton have brought in little significant progress, and it seems necessary and urgent to develop Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) for merging the superior genes related with high yield and wide adaptation from G. hirsutum and VW resistance and excellent fiber quality from G. barbadense. In this study, 300 CSSLs were chosen from the developed BC5F3:5 CSSLs constructed by G. hirsutum CCRI36 and G. barbadense Hai1 to conduct quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on VW resistance, and a total of 53 QTLs relevant to VW disease index (DI) were identified together with the phenotypic data of 2 years investigations in two fields with two replications per year. All the QTLs were distributed on 20 chromosomes with phenotypic variation of 3.74-11.89%, of which 29 stable ones were consistent in at least two environments. Based on Meta-analysis on the 53 QTLs, 43 novel ones were identified, while 10 ones consistent to previously identified QTLs. Meanwhile, 32 QTL hotspot regions were detected, including 15 ones were novel. This study concentrates on QTL identification and screening hotspot region related with VW in the 300 CSSLs, which lay a solid platform not only for revealing the genetic and molecular mechanisms of VW resistance, but also for further fine mapping, gene cloning and molecular designing in breeding program for resistant cotton varieties.",

Bio-informatics analysis were used to refine this list and the top seven microRNAs were validated in a larger panel of cells by flow-cytometry, and RTqPCR. The downstream mechanism of the strongest and most consistent candidate was investigated by siRNAs, 3UTR luciferase assays and Western Blotting.\\n\\nResultsOur screen identified [~]100 significantly cytotoxic microRNAs with 70% concordance between cell lines. MicroRNA-1300 (miR-1300) was the most potent and robust candidate. We observed a striking binucleated phenotype in miR-1300 expressing cells and characterized the mechanism of action as cytokinesis failure followed by apoptosis, which was observed in an extended GBM cell panel including two stem-like patient-derived cultures. We identified the physiological role of miR-1300 as a regulator of endomitosis in megakaryocyte differentiation where blockade of cytokinesis is an essential step. In glioblastoma cells, the oncogene Epithelial Cell Transforming 2 (ECT2) was validated as a direct key target of miR-1300. ECT2 siRNA phenocopied the effects of miR-1300, and its overexpression led to a significant rescue of miR-1300 induced binucleation.\\n\\nConclusionMiR-1300 was identified as a novel regulator of endomitosis with translatable potential for therapeutic application. The datatasets will be a resource for the neuro-oncology community.\\n\\nKey points (2 or 3 key points 85 characters plus spaces each)70% of cytotoxic microRNAs were shared between adult and pediatric glioblastoma cells\\n\\nMiR-1300 expression is restricted to endomitosis within megakaryocyte differentiation\\n\\nMiR-1300s ectopic expression is a potent and promising therapeutic tool in cancer\\n\\nImportance of StudyPrevious functional studies of microRNAs involved in the regulation of glioblastoma cell proliferation and/or survival have focused on adult glioblastoma alone and are restricted to only a few microRNAs at a time. Our study provides the first encompassing landscape of potent cytotoxic microRNAs in pediatric and adult glioblastoma.\\n\\nNot only, does our data provide an invaluable resource for the research community but it also revealed that 70% of microRNAs with significant cytotoxicity were shared by adult and pediatric cells. Finally, we identified and characterized the previously undescribed role of microRNA-1300 in the tight regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation into platelets and how, when expressed outside of this context, miR-1300 consistently causes cytokinesis failure followed by apoptosis, and thus represents a powerful cytotoxic tool with potential for translation towards therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that cleavage-furrow formation during cell division is driven by the contraction of a ring containing F-actin and type-II myosin. However, even in cells that have such rings, they are not always essential for furrow formation. Moreover, many taxonomically diverse eukaryotic cells divide by furrowing but have no type-II myosin, making it unlikely that an actomyosin ring drives furrowing. To explore this issue further, we have used one such organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We found that although F-actin is concentrated in the furrow region, none of the three myosins (of types VIII and XI) is localized there. Moreover, when F-actin was eliminated through a combination of a mutation and a drug, furrows still formed and the cells divided, although somewhat less efficiently than normal. Unexpectedly, division of the large Chlamydomonas chloroplast was delayed in the cells lacking F-actin; as this organelle lies directly in the path of the cleavage furrow, this delay may explain, at least in part, the delay in cell division itself. Earlier studies had shown an association of microtubules with the cleavage furrow, and we used a fluorescently tagged EB1 protein to show that at least the microtubule plus-ends are still associated with the furrows in the absence of F-actin, consistent with the possibility that the microtubules are important for furrow formation. We suggest that the actomyosin ring evolved as one way to improve the efficiency of a core process for furrow formation that was already present in ancestral eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Fasciola gigantica liver flukes are responsible for over 3 billion US dollars of production loss annually in farmed livestock and cause widespread zoonotic disease. Nevertheless, the understating of the emergence and spread of the trematode species is poor. The multiplicity of F. gigantica infection and its spread is potentially influenced by multiple factors, including the abundance of suitable intermediate hosts, climatic conditions favoring the completion of the parasites lifecycle, and translocation of infected animals or free-living parasite stages between regions. Here we describe the development of a  tremabiome metabarcoding sequencing method to explore the numbers of F. gigantica genotypes per infection and patterns of parasite spread, based on genetic characteristics of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1 (mt-ND-1) locus. We collected F. gigantica from three abattoirs in the Punjab and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan, and our results show a high level of genetic diversity in 20 F. gigantica populations derived from small and large ruminants consigned to slaughter in both provinces. This implies that F. gigantica can reproduce in its definitive hosts through meiosis involving cross- and self-breeding, as described in the closely related species, Fasciola hepatica. The genetic diversity between the 20 populations derived from different locations also illustrates the impact of animal movements on gene flow. Our results demonstrate the predominance of single haplotypes, consistent with a single introduction of F. gigantica infection in 85% of the hosts from which the parasite populations were derived. This is consistent with clonal reproduction in the intermediate snail hosts.",

    "abstract": "ContextWarmer weather caused by climate change poses increasingly serious threats to the persistence of many species, but animals can modify behavior to mitigate at least some of the threats posed by warmer temperatures. Identifying and characterizing how animals modify behavior to avoid the negative consequences of acute heat will be crucial for understanding how animals will respond to warmer temperatures in the future.\n\nObjectivesWe studied the extent to which moose (Alces alces), a species known to be sensitive to heat, mitigates heat on hot summer days via multiple different behaviors: (1) reduced movement, (2) increased visitation to shade, (3) increased visitation to water, or (4) a combination of these behaviors.\n\nMethodsWe used GPS telemetry and a step-selection function to analyze movement and habitat selection by moose in northeastern Minnesota, USA.\n\nResultsMoose reduced movement, used areas of the landscape with more shade, and traveled nearer to mixed forests and bogs during periods of heat. Moose used shade far more than water to ameliorate heat, and the most pronounced changes in behavior occurred between 15{degrees}C and 20{degrees}C.\n\nConclusionsResearch characterizing the behaviors animals use to facilitate thermoregulation will aid conservation of heat-sensitive species in a warming world. The modeling framework presented in this study is a promising method for evaluating the influence of temperature on movement and habitat selection.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have been developed recently, producing impressive outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, there is no standardized method for cell trafficking and in vivo CAR T-cell monitoring. We assessed the feasibility of real-time in vivo 89Zr-p-Isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS, DFO) labeled CAR T-cell trafficking using positron emission tomography (PET).\\n\\nResultsThe 89Zr-DFO radiolabeling efficiency of Jurkat/CAR and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC)/CAR T-cells was 70-79%, and cell radiolabeling activity was 98.1-103.6 kBq/106 cells. Cell viability after radiolabeling was >95%. Compared with unlabeled cells, cell proliferation was not significantly different during the early period after injection; however, the proliferative capacity decreased over time (p = 0.02, day 7 after labeling). IL-2 or IFN-{gamma} secretion was not significantly different between unlabeled and labeled CAR T-cells. PET/magnetic resonance images in the xenograft model showed that most of the 89Zr-DFO-labeled Jurkat/CAR T-cells were distributed in the lung (24.4% {+/-} 3.4%ID) and liver (22.9% {+/-} 5.6%ID) by 1 hour after injection. The cells gradually migrated from lung to the liver and spleen by day 1, and remained stably until day 7 (on day 7: lung 3.9% {+/-} 0.3%ID, liver 36.4% {+/-} 2.7%ID, spleen 1.4% {+/-} 0.3%ID). No significant accumulation of labeled cells was identified in tumors. A similar pattern was observed in ex vivo biodistributions on day 7 (lung 3.0% {+/-} 1.0%ID, liver 19.8% {+/-} 2.2%ID, spleen 2.3% {+/-} 1.7%ID). 89Zr-DFO-labeled hPBMC/CAR T-cells showed the similar distribution on serial PET images as Jurkat/CAR T-cells. The distribution of CAR T-cells was cross-confirmed by flow cytometry, Alu polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nConclusionUsing PET imaging of 89Zr-DFO-labeled CAR T-cells, real time in vivo cell trafficking is feasible. It can be used to investigate cellular kinetics, initial in vivo biodistribution, and the safety profile in future CAR T-cell development.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens of humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While infection of the mosquito and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquitos state, that is not the main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations capacity to transmit pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the quantity and quality of conscious experience may be a function of the complexity of activity in the brain, and that consciousness emerges in a critical zone on the axes of order/randomness and integration/differentiation. We propose fractal shapes as a measure of proximity to this critical point, as fractal dimension encodes information about complexity beyond simple entropy or randomness, and fractal structures are known to emerge in systems nearing a critical point. To validate this, we tested the several measures of fractal dimension on the brain activity from healthy volunteers and patients with disorders of consciousness of varying severity. We used a Compact Box Burning algorithm to compute the fractal dimension of cortical functional connectivity networks as well as computing the fractal dimension of the associated adjacency matrices using a 2D box-counting algorithm. To test whether brain activity is fractal in time as well as space, we used the Higuchi temporal fractal dimension on BOLD time-series. We found significant decreases in the fractal dimension between healthy volunteers (n=15), patients in a minimally conscious state (n=10), and patients in a vegetative state (n=8), regardless of the mechanism of injury. We also found significant decreases in adjacency matrix fractal dimension and Higuchi temporal fractal dimension, which correlated with decreasing level of consciousness. These results suggest that cortical functional connectivity networks display fractal character and that this is predictive of level of consciousness in a clinically relevant population, with more fractal (i.e. more complex) networks being associated with higher levels of consciousness. This supports the hypothesis that level of consciousness and system complexity are positively associated, and is consistent with previous EEG, MEG, and fMRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Self-controlled practice schedules have been shown to enhance motor learning in several contexts, but their effectiveness in structural learning tasks, where the goal is to eventually learn an underlying structure or rule, is not well known. Here we examined the use of self-controlled practice in a novel control interface requiring structural learning. In addition, we examined the effect of  nudging - i.e., whether altering task difficulty could influence self-selected strategies, and hence facilitate learning. Participants wore four inertial measurement units (IMUs) on their upper body and the goal was to use motions of the upper body to move a screen cursor to different targets presented on the screen. The structure in this task that had to be learned was based on the fact that the signals from the IMUs were linearly mapped to the x- and y-position of the cursor. Participants (N = 62) were split into 3 groups (random, self-selected, nudge) based on whether they had control over the sequence in which they could practice the targets. To test whether participants learned the underlying structure, participants were tested both on the trained targets, as well as novel targets that were not practiced during training. Results showed that during training, the self-selected group showed shorter movement times relative to the random group, and both self-selected and nudge groups adopted a strategy of tending to repeat targets. However, in the test phase, we found no significant differences in task performance between groups, indicating that structural learning was not reliably affected by the type of practice. In addition, nudging participants by adjusting task difficulty did not show any significant benefits to overall learning. These results suggest that although self-controlled practice influenced practice structure and facilitated learning, it did not provide any additional benefits relative to practicing on a random schedule in this task.",

In the present study, the inhibition of amyloid beta protein toxicity by the ethanolic extract of this plant is investigated for the first time. Preliminary biochemical analyses identified kaempferol and Luteolin-7-o-glucoside as the more abundant phenolic compounds. The effects of A. roseum extract (ARE) on amyloid beta-42 (A{beta}42) aggregation and aggregate cytotoxicity, were investigated by biophysical (ThT assay, Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy) and cellular assays (cytotoxicity, aggregate immunolocalization, ROS measurement and intracellular Ca2+ imaging). The biophysical data suggest that ARE affects the structure of A{beta}42 peptide, inhibits its polymerization, and interferes with the path of fibrillogenesis. The data with cultured cells shows that ARE reduces A{beta}42 aggregate toxicity by inhibiting aggregate binding to the cell membrane and by decreasing both oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+. Accordingly, ARE could act as a neuroprotective factor against A{beta} aggregate toxicity in Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Efficient irrigation water use can meet its objective if irrigated agriculture is managed properly in regions where water is limited. A two-year (2016-2017) field experiments were conducted in the semiarid areas of Tigray in northern Ethiopia to evaluate irrigation scheduling with different irrigation methods. The experiments were carried out to identify their contribution for enhancing onion and water productivity in water-stressed irrigation schemes of Korir and Hatset sites. Six factorial treatments comprising of three levels of irrigation methods (furrow, basin and flood) and two levels of irrigation scheduling (fixed interval and farmers practices) were evaluated with three replications. The agronomic and irrigation parameters were subjected to separate level-wise comparison followed by the factorial interaction effects. The results showed that the fixed irrigation interval, basin irrigation method and their factorial combinations showed better performances and produced a higher yield and water productivity. On average, 263.85 q/ha and 281 q/ha of onion were obtained under the basin irrigation method and basin irrigation with fixed irrigation interval (T2) at both sites and seasons. For the T2, 6.27 and 6.06 kg/m3 of water productivity (WP) and 4.39 and 4.24 kg/m3 of irrigation water productivity (IWP) were obtained at Korir and Hatset sites, respectively showing higher results as compared to other treatment combinations. Moreover, the basin irrigation method produces higher marketable onion bulbs that are essential for onion producers to earn maximum profit from selling and enhance their livelihoods. Treatments comprising basin method and fixed interval showed better onion and water productivity in the water-limited irrigation schemes of Tigray. Hence, focusing on enhanced irrigation scheduling techniques and irrigation methods are important for effective agricultural water management. Farmers, irrigation experts, water resources managers and decision-makers are suggested to use these techniques to save the limited water resources and increase agricultural productivity.",
