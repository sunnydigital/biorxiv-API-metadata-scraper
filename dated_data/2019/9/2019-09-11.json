    "abstract": "Everyday life unfolds continuously, yet we tend to remember past experiences as discrete event sequences or episodes. Although this phenomenon has been well documented, the brain mechanisms that support the transformation of continuous experience into memorable episodes remain unknown. Here we show that a sudden change in context, or  event boundary, elicits a burst of autonomic arousal, as indexed by pupil dilation. These boundaries during dynamic experience also led to the segmentation of adjacent episodes in later memory, evidenced by changes in memory for the timing, order, and perceptual details of recent event sequences. Critically, we find that distinct cognitive components of this pupil response were associated with both subjective (temporal distance judgements) and objective (temporal order discrimination) measures of episodic memory, suggesting that multiple arousal-mediated cognitive processes help construct meaningful mnemonic events. Together, these findings reveal that arousal processes may play a fundamental role in everyday memory organization.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated reach-to-grasp movements are often accompanied by rapid eye movements (saccades) that displace the desired object image relative to the retina. Parietal cortex compensates for this by updating reach goals relative to current gaze direction, but its role in the integration of oculomotor and visual orientation signals for updating grasp plans is unknown. Based on a recent perceptual experiment, we hypothesized that inferior parietal cortex (specifically supramarginal gyrus; SMG) integrates saccade and visual signals to update grasp plans in more superior parietal areas. To test this hypothesis, we employed a functional magnetic resonance adaptation paradigm, where saccades sometimes interrupted grasp preparation toward a briefly presented object that later reappeared (with the same/different orientation) just before movement. Right SMG and several parietal grasp areas, namely left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and bilateral superior parietal lobe (SPL), met our criteria for transsaccadic orientation integration: during movement preparation, they showed task-dependent saccade modulations and, during grasp execution, they were specifically sensitive to changes in object orientation that followed saccades. Finally, SMG showed enhanced functional connectivity with both prefrontal saccade areas (consistent with oculomotor input) and aIPS / SPL (consistent with sensorimotor output). These results support the general role of parietal cortex for the integration of visuospatial perturbations, and provide specific cortical modules for the integration of oculomotor and visual signals for grasp updating.\n\nSignificance StatementThe cortical mechanisms that update reach goals during eye movements are well documented, but it is not known how object features are linked to oculomotor signals when updating grasp plans. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation (fMRIa) and functional connectivity analysis to identify a cluster of inferior parietal (supramarginal gyrus) and superior parietal (intraparietal and superior parietal) regions that show functional connectivity with frontal cortex saccade centers, and also show saccade-specific modulations during unexpected changes in object / grasp orientation. This provides a network - complementary to the goal updater network - that integrates visuospatial updating into grasp plans, and may help explain some of the more complex symptoms associated with parietal damage such as constructional ataxia.",

    "abstract": "Despite mounting evidence of species redistribution as climate warms, our knowledge of the coupling between species range shifts and isotherm shifts is limited. Compiling a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts from 12,415 taxa, we show that only marine taxa closely track the shifting isotherms. In the oceans, the velocity of isotherm shifts interacts synergistically with anthropogenic disturbances and baseline temperatures such that isotherm tracking by marine life happens either in warm and undisturbed waters (e.g. Central Pacific Basin) or in colder waters where human activities are more pronounced (e.g. North Sea). On lands, increasing anthropogenic activities and temperatures negatively impact the capacity of terrestrial taxa to track isotherm shifts in latitude and elevation, respectively. This suggests that terrestrial taxa are lagging behind the shifting isotherms, most likely due to their wider thermal safety margin, more constrained physical environment for dispersal and higher availability of thermal microrefugia at shorter distances.",

    "abstract": "Temporal variations in microbial metacommunity structure and assembly processes in response to shifts in environmental conditions are poorly understood. Hence, we conducted a temporal field study by sampling rock pools in four-day intervals during a 5-week period that included strong changes in environmental conditions due to intensive rain. We characterized bacterial and microeukaryote communities by 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Using a suite of null-model approaches to assess dynamics in community assembly, we found that strong changes in environmental conditions induced small but significant temporal changes in assembly processes and triggered different responses in bacterial and microeukaryotic metacommunities, promoting distinct selection processes. Incidence-based approaches showed that the assemblies of both communities were mainly governed by stochastic processes. In contrast, abundance-based methods indicated the dominance of historical contingency and unmeasured factors in case of bacteria and microeukaryotes, respectively, which we distinguished from dispersal-related processes using additional tests. Taken together, our study highlights that community assembly processes are not static, and the relative importance of different assembly processes can vary under different conditions and between different microbial groups.",

With the continued growth of repositories of biomedical data and knowledge, increasingly varied kinds of information are available to train machine learning approaches to drug repurposing. However, existing efforts to integrate a diversity of data sources have been limited to only a small selection of data types, typically gene expression data, drug structural information, and protein interaction networks. In this study, we leverage a graph-based approach to integrate biological knowledge from 20 publicly accessible repositories to represent information involving 11 distinct bioentity types. We then employ a graph node embedding scheme and use utilize a random forest model to make novel predictions about which drugs can be used to treat certain diseases. Utilizing this approach, we find a performance improvement over existing computational drug repurposing approaches and find promising drug repositioning targets, including drug and disease pairs currently in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Advances in imaging methods such as electron microscopy, tomography, and other modalities are enabling high-resolution reconstructions of cellular and organelle geometries. Such advances pave the way for using these geometries for biophysical and mathematical modeling once these data can be represented as a geometric mesh, which, when carefully conditioned, enables the discretization and solution of partial differential equations. In this study, we outline the steps for a naive user to approach GAMer 2, a mesh generation code written in C++ designed to convert structural datasets to realistic geometric meshes, while preserving the underlying shapes. We present two example cases, 1) mesh generation at the subcellular scale as informed by electron tomography, and 2) meshing a protein with structure from x-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that the meshes generated by GAMer are suitable for use with numerical methods. Together, this collection of libraries and tools simplifies the process of constructing realistic geometric meshes from structural biology data.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAs biophysical structure determination methods improve, the rate of new structural data is increasing. New methods that allow the interpretation, analysis, and reuse of such structural information will thus take on commensurate importance. In particular, geometric meshes, such as those commonly used in graphics and mathematics, can enable a myriad of mathematical analysis. In this work, we describe GAMer 2, a mesh generation library designed for biological datasets. Using GAMer 2 and associated tools PyGAMer and BlendGAMer, biologists can robustly generate computer and algorithm friendly geometric mesh representations informed by structural biology data. We expect that GAMer 2 will be a valuable tool to bring realistic geometries to biophysical models.",

    "abstract": "As newer single-cell protocols generate increasingly more cells at reduced sequencing depths, the value of a higher read depth may be overlooked. Using data from three different single-cell RNA-seq protocols that lend themselves to having either higher read depth (Smart-seq) or many cells (MARS-seq and 10X), we evaluate their ability to recapitulate biological signals in the context of pseudo-spatial reconstruction. Overall, we find gene expression profiles after spatial-reconstruction analysis are highly reproducible between datasets despite being generated by different protocols and using different computational algorithms. While UMI based protocols such as 10X and MARS-seq allow for capturing more cells, Smart-seqs higher sensitivity and read-depth allows for analysis of lower expressed genes and isoforms. Additionally, we evaluate trade-offs for each protocol by performing subsampling analyses, and find that optimizing the balance between sequencing depth and number of cells within a protocol is important for efficient use of resources. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of selecting a protocol based on the biological questions and features of interest.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo assess neurofilament light chain (NfL), as a biomarker for Parkinsons disease (PD).\n\nMethodsWe quantified NfL in (1) longitudinal CSF samples from PD, other cognate/neurodegenerative disorders (OND), and healthy controls (HC); (2) a cross-sectional cohort with paired CSF and serum samples from participants with PD, OND, and HC, and (3) a large longitudinal validation cohort with serum samples from PD, OND, HC, prodromal conditions, and mutation carriers.\n\nResultsIn the longitudinal discovery cohort (1) NfL in CSF was highest in OND and higher in PD vs. HC across all visits (p<0.05) but did not change longitudinally. In the cross-sectional cohort (2) paired CSF and serum NfL samples were highly correlated (Spearmans rank [Formula]; p<10^-6). In the large validation cohort (3) mean baseline serum NfL was higher in PD (13{+/-}7.2pg/ml) vs. HC (12{+/-}6.7pg/ml; p=0.0336) and was highest in OND (18{+/-}7pg/ml; p=0.0351). Serum NfL increased longitudinally in PD vs. HC (p<0.01). Longitudinal motor scores were positively longitudinally associated with NfL, whereas some cognitive scores showed a negative longitudinal association with NfL.\n\nConclusionsNfL levels in serum samples are increased in PD vs. HC, increase significantly over time, and correlate with clinical measures of PD severity. Although the specificity of NfL in PD is low and more specific biomarkers are needed, serum NfL is the first blood-based biomarker candidate that could support disease stratification (PD vs. OND), track clinical progression, and possibly assess responsiveness to neuroprotective treatments. NfL as a biomarker of response to neuroprotective interventions remains to be determined.\n\nFunding sources for studyPPMI is sponsored by the Michael J.

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine research on the formation of social bonds has primarily focused on the role of nonapeptides. However, steroid hormones often act simultaneously to either inhibit or facilitate bonding. Testosterone is proposed to mediate a trade-off between male mating effort and nurturing behavior; therefore, low levels are predicted during periods of nurturing infant care and social bonding. In species where social bonding and support regulates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, we also expect glucocorticoid levels to be low during bonding periods. We investigated how immunoreactive urinary testosterone (iuT) and cortisol (iuC) were related to triadic male-infant-male interactions - a ritualized male bonding behavior - as well as infant care in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We collected >3000 hours of behavioral observation data during full-day focal animal follows from 14 adult males and quantified iuT and iuC from 650 urine samples. As predicted, both iuT and iuC were negatively correlated with rates of triadic interactions within-subjects in the hours preceding urination. We found no relationship between iuT and iuC with triadic interactions between-subjects. Infant care was weakly positively correlated to iuT and iuC within-subjects, but not between-subjects. The observed negative relationship between iuT and triadic interactions may be beneficial to lower competitive tendencies between adult males and to not inhibit bond formation. Lowered iuC could reflect increased bonding and perceived social support as triadic interactions predict future coalition formation in this species. Additionally, lowered iuC may be reflective of buffered tensions between males. The positive relationship of iuT and iuC with infant care suggests that the handling of infants in may be less nurturing but rather protective or competitive in this species. Measuring steroid hormones in relation to bonding and nurturing can help us interpret behaviors within the ecological contexts that they occur.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade the scientific community witnessed a large increase in Genome-Wide Association Study sample size, in the availability of large Biobanks and in the improvements of statistical methods to model genomes features. This have paved the way for the development of new prediction medicine tools that use genomic data to estimate disease risk. One of these tools is the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), a metric that estimates the genetic risk of an individual to develop a disease, based on a combination of a large number of genetic variants.\\n\\nUsing the largest prospective genotyped cohort available to date, the UK Biobank, we built a new PRS for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and assessed its predictive performances along with two additional PRS for Breast Cancer (BC), and Prostate Cancer (PC). When compared with previously published PRS, the newly developed PRS for CAD displayed higher AUC and positive predictive value. PRSs were able to stratify disease risks from 1.34% to 25.7% (CAD in men), from 0.26% to 8.62% (CAD in women), from 1.6% to 24.6% (BC), and from 1.4% to 24.3% (PC) in the lowest and highest percentiles, respectively. Additionally, the three PRSs were able to identify the 5% of the UK Biobank population with a relative risk for the diseases at least 3 times higher than the average.\\n\\nFamily history is a well recognised risk factor of CAD, BC, and PC and it is currently used to identify individuals at high risk of developing the diseases. We show that individuals with family history can have completely different disease risks based on PRS stratification: from 2.1% to 33% (CAD in men), from 0.56% to 10% (CAD in women), from 2.3% to 35.8% (BC), and from 1.0% to 34.0% (PC) in the lowest and highest percentiles, respectively. Additionally, the PRSs demonstrated higher predictive performance (AUCs (including age) CAD: 0.81, PC: 0.80, and BC: 0.68) than family history (AUCs (including age) CAD: 0.79, PC: 0.73, and BC: 0.61) in predicting the onset of diseases.\\n\\nHyperlipidemia is well known to be associated with higher CAD risk, but a predictive performance comparison between each lipoprotein and CAD PRS has never been assessed. PRS shows higher discrimination capacity and Odds ratio per Standard deviation than LDL, HDL, total cholesterol-HDL ratio, ApoA, ApoB, ApoB-ApoA ratio, and Lipoprotein(a). Comparing the empirical risk distribution between PRS and each lipoprotein, we show that lipoprotein thresholds, currently used in clinical practice, identify a population equal to or smaller than what can be identified with the PRS at the same CAD risk threshold. Moreover, there is not correlation (max{rho} : 0.137) between PRS and each lipoprotein, indicating that PRS captures different component of CAD etiology and identifies different people at high risk than those identified by lipoproteins, demonstrating to be an invaluable tool in CAD prevention.\\n\\nOne of the major impairment of the PRS usage in clinical practice is the computational complexity needed to calculate per-individual PRSs. Deep bioinformatics expertise is required to run the entire pipeline, from imputing genomic data, through quality control to result visualisation.

    "abstract": "Evidence points to breast cancer following a hierarchical model, with Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) driving critical phenotypes of the bulk tumor. Chemoresistant CSCs are not an abstract concept but have clinical consequences as they drive relapse and ultimately lead to mortality in patients, making it imperative to understand how these subpopulations of cells survive. Our previous work (1-2) has demonstrated that the bHLH transcription factor, Inhibitor of Differentiation 1 (Id1) and its closely related family member Id3, have an important role in maintaining the CSC phenotype in the Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. A genetic screen conducted to further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the Id (Id1/3) mediated CSC phenotypes in TNBC revealed critical cell cycle genes such as Kif11 and Aurka as putative Id targets. We take this work forward by investigating how alteration in Kif11 and Aurka via Id proteins promotes the CSC phenotype in TNBC. Cells lacking Id are poised in a state of G0/G1 arrest from which they can re-enter the cell cycle. Intriguingly, depletion of Kif11 and Aurka independently did not phenocopy the G0/G1 arrest observed in Id knockdown (Id KD) cells. We have further explored the hypothesis that we can deplete the chemo resistant Id expressing CSC population by combining chemotherapy with targeted therapy using existing small molecule inhibitors (against Id target Kif11) to more effectively debulk the entire tumor. This work opens up exciting new possibilities of targeting Id targets like Kif11, in the TNBC subtype which is currently refractory to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is one of the five different phosphoinositides (PPIs) species in plant cells, which regulate several aspects of plant growth and development, as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The mechanistic insights underlying PtdIns3P mode of action, specifically through PtdIns3P-binding effectors such as FYVE and PHOX proteins have been partially explored in plants with main focus on Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, they have been underexplored in other plant organisms such as bryophytes, the earliest diverging group of terrestrial flora.\\n\\nIn this study, we searched for genes coding for FYVE and PHOX domains containing sequences from different photosynthetic organisms in order to gather evolutionary insights on these PPI binding domains, followed by an in silico characterization of the FYVE and PHOX gene family in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PpFYVE proteins can be grouped in 7 subclasses, with an additional subclass whose FYVE domain was lost during evolution to higher plants. On the other hand, PpPHOX proteins are classified into 5 subclasses. Expression analyses based on RNAseq data together with the analysis of cis-acting regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions suggest the importance of these proteins in regulating stress responses but mainly developmental processes in P. patens. The results provide valuable information and robust candidate genes for future functional analysis aiming to further explore the role of this signaling pathway mainly during growth and development of tip growing cells and during the transition from 2D to 3D growth, which could provide ancestral regulatory players undertaken during plant evolution.",

    "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a deadly form of breast cancer due to the development of resistance to chemotherapy affecting over 30% of patients. New therapeutics and companion biomarkers are urgently needed. Recognizing the elevated expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1, encoded by SLC2A1) and associated metabolic dependencies in TNBC, we investigated the vulnerability of TNBC cell lines and patient-derived samples to GLUT1 inhibition. We report that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 with BAY-876 impairs the growth of a subset of TNBC cells displaying high glycolytic and lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rates. Pathway enrichment analysis of gene expression data implicates E2F Targets pathway activity as a surrogate of OXPHOS activity. Furthermore, the protein levels of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB1) are strongly correlated with the degree of sensitivity to GLUT1 inhibition in TNBC, where RB1-negative cells are insensitive to GLUT1 inhibition. Collectively, our results highlight a strong and targetable RB1-GLUT1 metabolic axis in TNBC and warrant clinical evaluation of GLUT1 inhibition in TNBC patients stratified according to RB1 protein expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem worldwide. Taxol derivatives-based chemotherapies or immunotherapies are usually proposed depending on the symptomatic status. In the case of immunotherapy, tumors develop robust immune escape mechanisms that abolish any protective response. However, Docetaxel has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy in a variety of cancers, but to date, the mechanism is still unknown. Herein, we showed first that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) expressed by prostate tumor cells is the principal immunological checkpoint responsible of the failure of immunotherapy; and that Docetaxel leads to the inhibition of Gal-3 expression in PCa cells as well as in clinical samples of mCRPC patients promoting a Th1 response. We thus optimized a prostate cancer animal model that undergoes surgical resection of the tumor like prostatectomy to mimic what is usually performed in patients. More importantly, using low and nontoxic doses of taxane prior to immunotherapy, we were able to directly impact the activation and proliferation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells through reducing the number of CD8+CD122+CD28-T cells and highly control tumor recurrence. Thus, Gal-3 expression by PCa cells is a key inhibitor for the success of immunotherapy, and low doses of Docetaxel with noncytotoxic effect on leukocyte survival should be used prior to vaccination for all PCa patients. This combined treatment sequence right after surgery would promote the preconditioning of the tumor microenvironment, allowing for effective anti-tumor immunotherapy and can be transferred rapidly to clinical therapeutic protocols.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate cortical circuits. Changes in cortical excitability following TMS are typically assessed by measuring changes in either conditioned motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) following paired-pulse TMS over motor cortex or evoked potentials measured with electroencephalography following single-pulse TMS (TEPs). However, it is unclear whether these two measures of cortical excitability index the same cortical response. Twenty-four healthy participants received local and interhemispheric paired-pulse TMS over motor cortex with eight inter-pulse intervals, suband suprathreshold conditioning intensities, and two different pulse waveforms, while MEPs were recorded from a hand muscle. TEPs were also recorded in response to single-pulse TMS using the conditioning pulse alone. The relationships between TEPs and conditioned-MEPs were evaluated using metrics sensitive to both their magnitude at each timepoint and their overall shape across time. The impacts of undesired sensory potentials resulting from TMS pulse and muscle contractions were also assessed on both measures. Both conditioned-MEPs and TEPs were sensitive to re-afferent somatosensory activity following motor-evoked responses, but over different post-stimulus timepoints. Moreover, the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in TEPs was strongly correlated with the sensory potentials, whereas early and local high-frequency responses showed minimal relationships. Accordingly, conditioned-MEPs did not correlate with TEPs in the time domain but showed high shape similarity with the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations in TEPs. Therefore, despite the effects of sensory confounds, the TEP and MEP measures share a response component, suggesting that they index a similar cortical response and perhaps the same neuronal populations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to promptly respond to behaviourally relevant events depends on both general alertness and phasic changes in attentional state driven by temporal expectations. Using a variable foreperiod simple reaction time (RT) task in four adult male rhesus macaques, we investigated the role of the cholinergic system in alertness and temporal expectation. Foreperiod-effects on RT reflect temporal expectation, while alertness is quantified as overall response speed. We measured these RT parameters under vehicle treatment and systemic administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine. We also investigated whether and to what extent the effects of scopolamine were reversed by donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor widely used for the treatment of dementia. In the control condition, RT showed a continuous decrease as the foreperiod duration increased, which clearly indicated the effect of temporal expectation on RT. This foreperiod effect was mainly detectable on the faster tail of the RT distribution and was eliminated by scopolamine. Furthermore, scopolamine treatment slowed down the average RT. Donepezil treatment was efficient on the slower tail of the RT distribution and improved scopolamine-induced impairments only on the average RT reflecting a general beneficial effect on alertness without any improvement in temporal expectation. The present results highlight the role of the cholinergic system in temporal expectation and alertness in primates and help delineate the efficacy and scope of donepezil and other cholinomimetic agents as cognitive enhancers in present and future clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "To provide novel insights into the biology of opioid dependence (OD) and opioid use (i.e., exposure, OE), we completed a genome-wide analysis comparing up to 4,503 OD cases, 4,173 opioid-exposed controls, and 32,500 opioid-unexposed controls. Among the variants identified, rs9291211 was associated with OE (a comparison of exposed vs. unexposed controls; z=-5.39, p=7.2x10-8). This variant regulates the transcriptomic profiles of SLC30A9 and BEND4 in multiple brain tissues and was previously associated with depression, alcohol consumption, and neuroticism. A phenome-wide scan of rs9291211 in the UK Biobank (N>360,000) found association of this variant with propensity to use dietary supplements (p=1.68x10-8). With respect to the same OE phenotype in the gene-based analysis, we identified SDCCAG8 (z=4.69, p=10-6), which was previously associated with educational attainment, risk-taking behaviors, and schizophrenia. In addition, rs201123820 showed a genome-wide significant difference between OD cases and unexposed controls (z=5.55, p=2.9x10-8) and a significant association with musculoskeletal disorders in the UK Biobank (p=4.88x10-7). A polygenic risk score (PRS) based on a GWAS of risk-tolerance (N=466,571) was positively associated with OD (OD cases vs. unexposed controls, p=8.1x10-5; OD cases vs. exposed controls, p=0.054) and OE (exposed controls vs. unexposed controls, p=3.6x10-5). A PRS based on a GWAS of neuroticism (N=390,278) was positively associated with OD (OD cases vs. unexposed controls, p=3.2x10-5; OD cases vs. exposed controls, p=0.002) but not with OE (p=0.671).

    "abstract": "Maintaining zero transmission after malaria elimination will be a challenging task for many countries where malaria is still endemic. When local transmission potential is high, and importation of malaria infections continues from neighboring areas with ongoing transmission, malaria programs must develop robust surveillance and outbreak response systems. However, the requirements for such systems remain unclear. Using an agent-based, spatial microsimulation model of two areas in southern Zambia, where elimination efforts are currently underway, we compare the ability of various routine and reactive intervention packages to maintain near-zero prevalence in the face of continued importation. We find that in formerly moderate-transmission areas, high treatment rate of symptomatic malaria is sufficient to prevent reestablishment of malaria. Routine redistributions of insecticide-treated nets and reactive case detection with antimalarial drugs cannot completely compensate for inadequate case management. In formerly high-transmission areas, excellent case management and maintenance of good bednet coverage are both required to prevent resurgence, and outbreak response with antimalarial drugs or additional vector control is also necessary. These results begin to describe the essential criteria for operations that successfully prevent reestablishment of malaria post-elimination and highlight the need for both long-term, sustainable excellence in primary care and comprehensive surveillance that feeds into rapid and flexible outbreak response.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe global community is working toward malaria elimination, but some areas will eliminate before others. Eliminated areas will need to develop intervention programs capable of preventing imported infections from leading to reestablishment, a particular challenge when transmission was previously very high. Past experience has shown that stopping elimination interventions leads to massive resurgence, but it is unclear which interventions must be continued, which can be stopped to conserve resources, and what new interventions should be deployed. Using a simulation model built to capture malaria transmission and intervention history of two areas that recently made enormous progress toward elimination, we tested how well different intervention programs were able to prevent reestablishment of malaria. We found that treating as many symptomatic cases as possible was the single most important intervention to implement. In some contexts, this intervention alone was sufficient to prevent reestablishment. Other areas with historically higher transmission required maintaining vector control to contain mosquito populations. Localized outbreak response with antimalarial drugs or additional vector control was also necessary and predicted to be a highly efficient use of resources. These findings provide quantitative guidance for policy-makers considering how to stratify eliminated areas and plan new operational modes for the post-elimination era.",

We have previously shown that carnosine has both short-term and long-lasting neuroprotective effects in a hypoxia-ischemia(HI) rat model. In the mature brain, post-ischemia neuronal survival involves in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, whether the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway also plays an important role in the immature brain still remain unclear.The goal of this study is to detect the effection of carnosine on inflammation response following HI, further evidencing neuroprotection of carnosine. We measured total Akt, phospho-Akt (p-AKT) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) protein levels by western blot assay and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and TNFR1 mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR. We found the carnosine-pretreated group had statistically significant downregulation of TNF- mRNA levels 24 h after HI (P < 0.05). Similar results were observed when we measured TNFR1 mRNA levels both 24h and 72h after HI (P < 0.05). And the TNFR1 protein expression after HI was markedly decreased at 24 and 72 h post-HI in the carnosine-pretreated rats(P < 0.05). Nevertheless, the rats pretreated with carnosine showed a marked increase in p-Akt levels (P< 0.05). And the pro-apoptotic protein Bad was also examined using immunohistochemistry after 24 and 72 h of all groups. We found significantly fewer Bad-positive cells in the carnosine-pretreated group at each time point after HI (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that carnosine pretreatment inhibits the HI-induced inflammatory response, and neuroprotection mechanism of carnosine involved in activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Post-Activation Potentiation is a phenomenon by which muscular performance characteristics are acutely enhanced as a result of their previous contractile actions. It has been shown how Post-Activation Potentiation, which is usually evoked through heavy resistance exercise, has the potential to improve many different power performances, such as sprinting and jumping. Due to an easier applicability, some studies explored the potential of plyometric muscular actions to evoke the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation. Despite some findings on acceleration running performance, to the authors best knowledge, no studies investigated the effects of Post-Activation Potentiation on deceleration performance, which is a key factor in sports involving change of directions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a plyometric exercise protocol to a subsequent deceleration running performance. University soccer players (n = 18) performed 7 deceleration trials: at baseline and after [~] 15 seconds, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 minutes a walking control condition (C) or 3 sets of 10 repetitions of alternate-leg bounding (plyometric, P). Results show that no significant differences were found at any of the trials of the control condition (C) in comparison to the relative baseline. In the plyometric condition (P), the deceleration performance executed 2 minutes after the plyometric activity resulted significantly faster compared to the relative baseline (p = 0.042; ES = 0.86, large effect; % of improvement = 4.13 %). Therefore, the main findings of this study showed that a plyometric exercise has the potential to improve a subsequent running deceleration performance in soccer players, if an adequate recovery between these activities is provided to the players. These findings encourage further future investigations about the possible potentiating effects of plyometric activities on more complex actions like changes of direction and agility.",

    "abstract": "RecA is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein for bacterial homologous recombination and SOS response activation. Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 possesses two recA genes, and their functions and mechanisms are almost unclear. Here, we showed that the transcription of recA1 (MXAN_1441) was less than one-tenth of recA2 (MXAN_1388). Expressions of the two recA genes were both induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, but in different periods. Deletion of recA1 did not affect the growth, but significantly decreased the UV-irradiation survival, the homologous recombination ability, and the induction of the LexA-dependent SOS genes. Comparably, the deletion of recA2 markedly prolonged the lag phase for cellular growth and antioxidation of hydrogen peroxide, but did not change the UV-irradiation resistance and the SOS-gene inducibility. The two RecA proteins are both DNA-dependent ATPase enzymes. We demonstrated that RecA1, but not RecA2, had in vitro DNA recombination capacity and LexA-autolysis promotion activity. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that the duplicate RecA2 has evolved to mainly regulate the gene expressions for cellular transportation and antioxidation. We discuss the potential mechanisms for the functional divergence. This is the first time to clearly determine the divergent functions of duplicated recA genes in bacterial cells. The present results highlight that the functional divergence of RecA duplicates facilitates the exertion of multiple RecA functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMyxobacteria has a large-size genome, contains many DNA repeats that are rare in the prokaryotic genome. It encodes bacterial RecA that could promote recombination between homologous DNA sequences. How myxobacteria avoid the undesired recombination between DNA repeats in its genome is an interesting question. M. xanthus encodes two RecA proteins, RecA1 (MXAN_1441) and RecA2 (MXAN_1388). Both RecA1 and RecA2 shows more than 60% sequence consistency with E. coli RecA (EcRecA) and can partly restore the UV resistance of E. coli recA mutant. Here, our results proved their divergent functions of the two RecAs. RecA1 retains the ability to catalyze DNA recombination, but its basal expression level is very low. RecA2 basal expression level is high, but no recombination activity is detected in vitro. This may be a strategy for M. xanthus to adapt to more repetitive sequences in its genome and avoid incorrect recombination.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIM. xanthus has two recAs, which are expressed with significantly different levels. Both recAs are inducible by UV irradiation, but in different stages.\\nC_LIO_LIThe absence of recA1 reduces bacterial UV-irradiation resistance, while the absence of recA2 delays bacterial growth and antioxidant capacity.\\nC_LIO_LIRecA1 retains the DNA recombination and SOS induction abilities, while RecA2 has evolved to regulate the expression of genes for cellular transport and antioxidation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Disease mapping aims to determine the underlying disease risk from scattered epidemiological data and to represent it on a smoothed colored map. This methodology is based on Bayesian inference and is classically dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose cases distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. Over the last decades, disease mapping has received many major improvements to extend its scope of application: integrating the temporal dimension, dealing with missing data, taking into account various a prioris (environmental and population covariates, assumptions concerning the repartition and the evolution of the risk), dealing with overdispersion, etc. We aim to adapt this approach to rare infectious diseases. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood; this can result in local overdispersion and in higher spatial and temporal dependencies due to direct and/or indirect transmission. We have proposed and tested 60 Bayesian hierarchical models on 400 simulated datasets and bovine tuberculosis real data. This analysis shows the relevance of the CAR (Conditional AutoRegressive) processes to deal with the structure of the risk. We can also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. In addition our study provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (real data).\\n\\nAuthor summaryDisease mapping is dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. In this paper, we aim to adapt this approach to rare infectious pathologies. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood, resulting in local overdispersion and in high spatial and temporal dependencies. We thus explored different adapted spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal links and highlight the most adapted to likely risk structures for infectious diseases. We also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. Our study also provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (in case of simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (when applying to real data). Thus disease mapping appears as a promising way to investigate rare infectious diseases.",
