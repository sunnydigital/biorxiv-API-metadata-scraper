    "abstract": "In comparison to protein coding sequences, the impact of mutation and natural selection on the sequence and function of non-coding (ncRNA) genes is not well understood. Many ncRNA genes are narrowly distributed to only a few organisms, and appear to be rapidly evolving. Compared to protein coding sequences, there are many challenges associated with assessment of ncRNAs that are not well addressed by conventional phylogenetic approaches, including: short sequence length, lack of primary sequence conservation, and the importance of secondary structure for biological function. Riboswitches are structured ncRNAs that directly interact with small molecules to regulate gene expression in bacteria. They typically consist of a ligand-binding domain (aptamer) whose folding changes drive changes in gene expression. The glycine riboswitch is among the most well-studied due to the widespread occurrence of a tandem aptamer arrangement (tandem), wherein two homologous aptamers interact with glycine and each other to regulate gene expression. However, a significant proportion of glycine riboswitches are comprised of single aptamers (singleton). Here we use graph clustering to circumvent the limitations of traditional phylogenetic analysis when studying the relationship between the tandem and singleton glycine aptamers. Graph clustering enables a broader range of pairwise comparison measures to be used to assess aptamer similarity. Using this approach, we show that one aptamer of the tandem glycine riboswitch pair is typically much more highly conserved, and that which aptamer is conserved depends on the regulated gene. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that singleton aptamers are more similar to either the first or second tandem aptamer, again based on the regulated gene. Taken together, our findings suggest that tandem glycine riboswitches degrade into functional singletons, with the regulated gene(s) dictating which glycine-binding aptamer is conserved.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe glycine riboswitch is a ncRNA responsible for the regulation of several distinct gene sets in bacteria that is found with either one (singleton) or two (tandem) aptamers, each of which directly senses glycine. Which aptamer is more important for gene-regulation, and the functional difference between tandem and singleton aptamers, are long-standing questions in the riboswitch field. Like many biologically functional RNAs, glycine aptamers require a specific 3D folded conformation. Thus, they have low primary sequence similarity across distantly related homologs, and large changes in sequence length that make creation and analysis of accurate multiple sequence alignments challenging. To better understand the relationship between tandem and singleton aptamers, we used a graph clustering approach that allows us to compare the similarity of aptamers using metrics that measure both sequence and structure similarity. Our investigation reveals that in tandem glycine riboswitches, one aptamer is more highly conserved than the other, and which aptamer is conserved depends on what gene(s) are regulated. Moreover, we find that many singleton glycine riboswitches likely originate from tandem riboswitches in which the ligand-binding site of the non-conserved aptamer has degraded over time.",

    "abstract": "TraR and its homolog DksA are bacterial proteins that regulate transcription initiation by binding directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) rather than to promoter DNA. Effects of TraR mimic the combined effects of DksA and its cofactor ppGpp. How TraR and its homologs regulate transcription is unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of Escherichia coli RNAP, with or without TraR, and of an RNAP-promoter complex. TraR binding induced RNAP conformational changes not seen in previous crystallographic analyses, and a quantitative analysis of RNAP conformational heterogeneity revealed TraR-induced changes in RNAP dynamics. These changes involve mobile regions of RNAP affecting promoter DNA interactions, including the {beta}lobe, the clamp, the bridge helix, and several lineage-specific insertions. Using mutational approaches, we show that these structural changes, as well as effects on {sigma}70 region 1.1, are critical for transcription activation or inhibition, depending on the kinetic features of regulated promoters.",

    "abstract": "Despite the interest in characterizing all genomic variation, the presence of large repeats at the breakpoints of many structural variants hinders their analysis. This is especially problematic in the case of inversions, since they are balanced changes without gain or loss of DNA. Here we tested novel linkage-based droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays on 20 inversions ranging from 3.1 to 742 kb and flanked by long inverted repeats (IRs) of up to 134 kb. Among these, we validated 13 inversions predicted by different genome-wide techniques. In addition, we have generated new experimental human population information across 95 African, European and East-Asian individuals for 16 of them, including four already known inversions for which there were no high-throughput methods to determine directly the orientation, like the well-characterized 17q21 inversion. Through comparison with previous data, independent replicates and both inversion breakpoints, we have demonstrated that the technique is highly accurate and reproducible. Most of the studied inversions are frequent and widespread across continents, showing a negative correlation with genetic length. Moreover, all except two show clear signs of being recurrent, and the new data allowed us to define more clearly the factors affecting recurrence levels and estimate the inversion rate across the genome. Finally, thanks to the generated genotypes, we have been able to check inversion functional effects in multiple tissues, validating gene expression differences reported before for two inversions and finding new candidate associations. Our work therefore provides a tool to screen these and other complex genomic variants quickly in a large number of samples for the first time, highlighting the importance of direct genotyping to assess their potential consequences and clinical implications.",

They are abundant in marine environments and have a substantial role in marine ecology and biogeochemistry. However, interactions between roseobacters and other bacterioplankton have not been extensively explored. In this study, we identify a killing mechanism in the model Roseobacter Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 by competing it against a group of phylogenetically diverse bacteria. The killing mechanism involves an unidentified antimicrobial compound that is produced when cells are grown on both surfaces and in suspension and is dependent on cell density. A screen of random transposon mutants revealed the killing phenotype, as well as resistance to the antimicrobial, require genes within an ~8 kb putative {gamma}-butyrolactone synthesis gene cluster, which resembles similar pheromone-sensing systems in actinomycetes that regulate secondary metabolite production. Transcriptomics revealed the gene cluster is highly upregulated in wild-type DSS-3 compared to a non-killer mutant when grown in liquid coculture with a roseobacter target. Our findings show that R. pomeroyi has the capability to eliminate closely- and distantly-related competitors, providing a mechanism to alter the community structure and function in its native habitats.",

    "abstract": "The retinal output is the sole source of visual information for the brain. Studies in non-primate mammals estimate that this information is carried by several dozens of retinal ganglion cell types, each informing the brain about different aspects of a visual scene. Even though morphological studies of primate retina suggest a similar diversity of ganglion cell types, research has focused on the function of only a few cell types. In human retina, recordings from individual cells are anecdotal or focus on a small subset of identified types. Here, we present the first systematic ex-vivo recording of light responses from 342 ganglion cells in human retinas obtained from donors. We find a great variety in the human retinal output in terms of preferences for positive or negative contrast, spatio-temporal frequency encoding, contrast sensitivity, and speed tuning. Some human ganglion cells showed similar response behavior as known cell types in other primates, while we also recorded light responses that have not been described previously. This first extensive description of the human retinal output should facilitate interpretation of primate data and comparison to other mammalian species, and it lays the basis for the use of ex-vivo human retina for in-vitro analysis of novel treatment approaches.",

The smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFSEM) is a critical node in the neural circuit controlling smooth pursuit eye movement. Preparatory activity evolves in FEFSEM during fixation in parallel with an objective measure of visual-motor gain. We propose that the use of FEFSEM output as a gain signal allows for preparation to progress in the pursuit system without causing movement. We also show that preparatory modulation of firing rate in FEFSEM progresses in a way that predicts movement, providing evidence against the \\\"movement-null\\\" space hypothesis of how preparatory activity can progress without movement. Finally, there is partial reorganization of FEFSEM population activity between preparation and movement. We propose that this reorganization allows for a directionally non-specific component of preparatory visual-motor gain enhancement in the pursuit system.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in translating findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to biological mechanisms is pinpointing functional variants because only a very small percentage of variants associated with a given trait actually impact the trait. We used an extensive epigenetics, transcriptomics, and genetics analysis of the TBX15/WARS2 neighborhood to prioritize this regions best-candidate causal variants for the genetic risk of osteoporosis (estimated bone density, eBMD) and obesity (waist-hip ratio or waist circumference adjusted for body mass index). TBX15 encodes a transcription factor that is important in bone development and adipose biology. Manual curation of 692 GWAS-derived variants gave eight strong candidates for causal SNPs that modulate TBX15 transcription in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) or osteoblasts, which highly and specifically express this gene. None of these SNPs were prioritized by Bayesian fine-mapping. The eight regulatory causal SNPs were in enhancer or promoter chromatin seen preferentially in SAT or osteoblasts at TBX15 intron-1 or upstream. They overlap strongly predicted, allele-specific transcription factor binding sites. Our analysis suggests that these SNPs act independently of two missense SNPs in TBX15. Remarkably, five of the regulatory SNPs were associated with eBMD and obesity and had the same trait-increasing allele for both. We found that WARS2 obesity-related SNPs can be ascribed to high linkage disequilibrium with TBX15 intron-1 SNPs. Our findings from GWAS index, proxy, and imputed SNPs suggest that a few SNPs, including three in a 0.7-kb cluster, act as causal regulatory variants to fine-tune TBX15 expression and, thereby, affect both obesity and osteoporosis risk.",

This study principally focuses on topological congruence metrics that quantify similarity between two dendrograms and can give a normalised score between 0 and 1. Specifically, this article describes and tests two metrics the Clade Retention Index (CRI) and the MASTxCF which is derived from the combined information available from a maximum agreement subtree and a strict consensus. The two metrics were developed to study differences between evolutionary trees, but their applications are multidisciplinary and can be used on hierarchical cluster diagrams derived from analyses in science, technology, maths or social sciences disciplines. A comprehensive, but non-exhaustive review of other tree congruence metrics is provided and nine metrics are further analysed. 1,620 pairwise analyses of simulated dendrograms (which could be derived from any type of analysis) were conducted and are compared in Pac-man piechart matrices. Kendalls tau-b is used to demonstrate the concordance of the different metrics and Spearmans rho ranked correlations are used to support these findings. The results support the use of the CRI and MASTxCF as part of a suite of metrics, but it is recommended that permutation metrics such as SPR distances and weighted metrics are disregarded for the specific purpose of measuring similarity.",

We also show that multiple experimental designs with different numbers of samples, cells per sample and reads per cell could have similar statistical power, and choosing an appropriate design can yield large cost savings especially when multiplexed workflows are considered. Finally, we provide a practical approach on selecting cost-effective designs for maximizing cell-type-specific eQTL power.",

    "abstract": "Our senses of hearing and balance rely on the extraordinarily sensitive molecular machinery of the inner ear to convert deflections as small as the width of a single carbon atom1,2 into electrical signals that the brain can process3. In humans and other vertebrates, transduction is mediated by hair cells4, where tension on tip links conveys force to mechanosensitive ion channels5. Each tip link comprises two helical filaments of atypical cadherins bound at their N-termini through two unique adhesion bonds6-8. Tip links must be strong enough to maintain a connection to the mechanotransduction channel under the dynamic forces exerted by sound or head movement--yet might also act as mechanical circuit breakers, releasing under extreme conditions to preserve the delicate structures within the hair cell. Previous studies have argued that this connection is exceptionally static, disrupted only by harsh chemical conditions or loud sound9-12. However, no direct mechanical measurements of the full tip-link connection have been performed. Here we describe the dynamics of the tip-link connection at single-molecule resolution and show how avidity conferred by its double stranded architecture enhances mechanical strength and lifetime, yet still enables it to act as a dynamic mechanical circuit breaker. We also show how the dynamic strength of the connection is facilitated by strong cis-dimerization and tuned by extracellular Ca2+, and we describe the unexpected etiology of a hereditary human deafness mutation. Remarkably, the connection is several thousand times more dynamic than previously thought, challenging current assumptions about tip-link stability and turnover rate, and providing insight into how the mechanotransduction apparatus conveys mechanical information. Our results reveal fundamental mechanisms that underlie mechanoelectric transduction in the inner ear, and provide a foundation for studying multi-component linkages in other biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria exploit a diverse set of defenses to survive exposure to antibiotics. While the molecular and genetic underpinnings of antibiotic resistance are increasingly understood, less is known about how these molecular events influence microbial dynamics on the population scale. In this work, we show that the dynamics of E. faecalis communities exposed to antibiotics can be surprisingly rich, revealing scenarios where-for example-increasing population size or delaying drug exposure can promote population collapse. Specifically, we combine experiments in computer-controlled bioreactors with simple mathematical models to reveal density-dependent feedback loops that couple population growth and antibiotic efficacy when communities include drug-resistant ({beta}-lactamase producing) subpopulations. The resulting communities exhibit a wide range of behavior, including population survival, population collapse, or one of two qualitatively distinct bistable behaviors where survival is favored in either small or large populations. These dynamics reflect competing density-dependent effects of different subpopulations, with growth of drug-sensitive cells increasing but growth of drug-resistant cells decreasing effective drug inhibition. Guided by these results, we experimentally demonstrate how populations receiving immediate drug influx may sometimes thrive, while identical populations exposed to delayed drug influx (and lower average drug concentrations) collapse. These results illustrate that the spread of drug resistant determinants--even in a simplified single-species communities--may be governed by potentially counterintuitive dynamics driven by population-level interactions.",

    "abstract": "Since their introduction in the late eighties, Bayesian approaches for neuroimaging have opened the way to new powerful and quantitative analysis of brain data. Here, we apply this statistical framework to evaluate empirically the gain of fused EEG-MEG source reconstruction, compared to unimodal (EEG or MEG) one. Combining EEG and MEG information for source reconstruction has been consistently evidenced to enhance localization performances using simulated data. However, given considerable efforts to conduct simultaneous recordings, empirical evaluation becomes necessary to quantify the real information gain. And this is obviously not straightforward due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Here, we consider Bayesian model comparison to quantify the ability of EEG, MEG and fused (EEG/MEG) inversions of individual data to resolve spatial source models. These models consisted in group-level cortical distributions inferred from real EEG, MEG and EEG/MEG brain responses. We applied this comparative evaluation to the timely issue of the generators of auditory mismatch responses evoked by unexpected sounds. These included the well-known Mismatch Negativity (MMN) but also earlier deviance responses. As expected, fused localization was evidenced to outperform unimodal inversions with larger model separability. The present methodology confirms with real data the theoretical interest of simultaneous EEG/MEG recordings and fused inversion to highly inform (spatially and temporally) source modeling. Precisely, a bilateral fronto-temporal network could be identified for both the MMN and early deviance response. Interestingly, multimodal inversions succeeded in revealing spatio-temporal details of the functional organization within the supratemporal plane that have not been reported so far, nor were visible here with unimodal inversions. The present refined auditory network could serve as priors for auditory modeling studies.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria construct many structures, like the flagellar hook and the type III secretion system, that aid in crucial processes such as locomotion and pathogenesis. Experimental work has suggested two competing mechanisms bacteria could use to regulate length in these structures: the \\\"ruler\\\" mechanism and the \\\"substrate switching\\\" mechanism. In this work, we constructed a mathematical model of length control based on the ruler mechanism, and found that the predictions of this model are consistent with experimental data not just for the scaling of the average length with the ruler protein length, but also the variance. Interestingly, we found that the ruler mechanism allows for the evolution of needles with large average lengths without the concomitant large increase in variance that occurs in the substrate switching mechanism. These findings shed new light on the trade-offs that may have lead to the evolution of different length control mechanisms in different bacterial species.",

Functional characterisation of GWAS loci has been biased towards the effect of regulatory SNPs on transcription factor binding. Here we set out to determine the extent of the contribution of breast cancer risk-associated SNPs to alternative splicing (AS).\\n\\nWe screened genome-wide significant (P [&le;] 5 x 10-8) BC risk SNPs for association with AS, using expression and genotype data from normal breast samples, from the GTEx project. We identified four splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL). In locus 6p22.1, rs6456883 is a significant cis-sQTL for the expression of ZNF311 gene isoforms. Three SNPs in locus 8p23.3, rs6682326, rs3008282 and rs2906324, were also identified as significant cis-sQTLs/svQTLs for the expression of RPL23AP53 gene isoforms. In-silico functional analysis revealed that these variants can potentially alter enhancer splicing elements within the target genes.\\n\\nOur work shows that BC risk-associated variants at two loci are associated with AS isoforms in normal breast tissue, thus demonstrating that AS plays an important role in breast cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, it supports that all cis-regulatory mechanisms should be considered in the functional characterisation of risk loci.",

The paucity of therapies for tendon is due to our limited understanding of the cells and molecules that drive tendon regeneration. Using a model of neonatal mouse tendon regeneration, we determined the molecular basis for regeneration and identify TGF{beta} signaling as a major pathway. Through targeted gene deletion, small molecule inhibition, and lineage tracing, we elucidated TGF{beta}-dependent and -independent mechanisms underyling tendon regeneration. Importantly, functional recovery depended on TGF{beta} signaling and loss of function is due to impaired tenogenic cell recruitment from both Scxlin and non-Scxlin sources. We show that TGF{beta} signaling is required directly in neonatal tenocytes for recruitment and that TGF{beta} is positively regulated in tendons. Collectively, these results are the first to show a functional role for TGF{beta} signaling in tendon regeneration and offer new insights toward the divergent cellular activities that may lead to regenerative vs fibrotic healing.",

    "abstract": "Although the lineage-determining ability of transcription factors is often modulated according to cellular context, the mechanisms by which such switching occurs are not well known. Using a transcriptional programming model, we found that Atoh1 is repurposed from a neuronal to an inner ear hair cell (HC) determinant by the combined activities of Gfi1 and Pou4f3. In this process, Atoh1 maintains its regulation of neuronal genes but gains ability to regulate HC genes. Pou4f3 enables Atoh1 access to genomic locations controlling the expression of sensory (including HC) genes, but Atoh1+Pou4f3 are not sufficient for HC differentiation. Gfi1 is key to the Atoh1-induced lineage switch, but surprisingly does not alter Atoh1s binding profile. Gfi1 acts in two divergent ways. It represses the induction by Atoh1 of genes that antagonise HC differentiation, a function in keeping with its well-known repressor role in haematopoiesis. Remarkably, we find that Gfi1 also acts as a co-activator: it binds directly to Atoh1 at existing target genes to enhance its activity. These findings highlight the diversity of mechanisms by which one TF can redirect the activity of another to enable combinatorial control of cell identity.",

We present structures of two HeR-48C12 states at 1.5 [A] showing its remarkable difference from all known rhodopsins. Its internal extracellular part is completely hydrophobic, while the cytoplasmic part comprises a cavity (active site), surrounded by charged amino acids and containing a cluster of water molecules, presumably being a primary proton acceptor from the Schiff base. At acidic pH a planar triangle molecule (acetate) is present in the  active site which demonstrated its ability to maintain such anions as carbonate or nitrate. Structure-based bioinformatic analysis identified 10 subfamilies of HeRs suggesting their diverse biological functions. The structures and available data suggest an enzymatic activity of HeR-48C12 subfamily and their possible involvement into fundamental redox biological processes.",

Of particular importance are membrane proteins that mediate membrane fusion events with and within the Golgi - the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). In the Golgi of budding yeast cells a single syntaxin - the SNARE Sed5p - oversees membrane fusion within the Golgi. Determining how Sed5p is localized to and trafficked within the Golgi is critical to informing our understanding of the mechanism(s) of biogenesis and homeostasis of this organelle. Here we establish that the Golgi retention and trafficking of Sed5p between the Golgi and the ER is independent of COPI function, the composition of the transmembrane domain, and binding of the Sec1-Munc18 (SM) protein Sly1p. Rather, the steady state localization of Sed5p to the Golgi appears to be primarily conformation-based relying on intra-molecular associations between the Habc domain and SNARE-motif.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle derives from dorsal mesoderm that is formed during vertebrate gastrulation. Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling is known to cooperate with transcription factors of the Tbx family to promote dorsal mesoderm formation, but the role of these proteins in skeletal myogenesis has been unclear. Using the zebrafish, we show that dorsally-derived Fgf signals act through Tbx16 and Tbxta to induce two populations of slow and fast trunk muscle precursors at distinct dorsoventral positions. Tbx16 binds to and directly activates the myf5 and myod genes that are required for commitment to skeletal myogenesis. Tbx16 activity depends on Fgf signalling from the organiser. In contrast, Tbxta is not required for myf5 expression. However, Tbxta binds to a specific site upstream of myod not bound by Tbx16, driving myod expression in the adaxial slow precursors dependent upon Fgf signals, thereby initiating muscle differentiation in the trunk. After gastrulation, when similar muscle cell populations in the post-anal tail are generated from the tailbud, declining Fgf signalling is less effective at initiating adaxial myogenesis, which is instead initiated by Hedgehog signalling from the notochord. Our findings provide insight into the ancestral vertebrate trunk myogenic pattern and how it was co-opted during tail evolution to generate similar muscle by new mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities are assembled by colonization and extinction events, that may be regulated by ecological niches1-5. The most parsimonious explanation of local community assembly is the Dynamic Equilibrium (DE) model, which assumes that community dynamics is shaped by random colonization and extinctions events, effectively ignoring the effects of niches1, 6. Despite its empirical success in explaining diversity patterns1, 5, 7, it is unknown to what extent the assembly dynamics of communities around the globe are consistent with this model. Using a newly developed methodology, we show that in 4989 communities from 49 different datasets, representing multiple taxa, biomes and locations, changes in richness and composition are larger than expected by DE. All the fundamental assumptions of DE are violated, but the large changes in species richness and composition primarily stem from the synchrony in the dynamics of different species. These results indicate that temporal changes in communities are predominantly driven by shared responses of co-occurring species to environmental changes, rather than by inter-specific competition. This finding is in sharp contrast to the long-term recognition of competition as a primary driver of species assembly8-12. While ecological niches are often thought to stabilize species diversity and composition4, 13, 14, we found that they promote large changes in ecological communities.",

Several Nups assemble into a sieve-like hydrogel within the central channel of the NPCs to regulate nucleocytoplasmic exchange.

Downregulation of FXR1 or closely related orthologs FXR2 and Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic Nup protein condensates. Likewise, several models of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), characterized by a loss of FMRP, also accumulate cytoplasmic Nup aggregates.

In behavioral studies, pattern completion is often inferred through the false endorsement of lure (i.e., similar) items as old. However, evidence that such a response is due to the specific retrieval of a similar, previously encoded item is severely lacking. We used eye movement (EM) monitoring during a partial-cue recognition memory task to index reinstatement of lure images behaviorally via the recapitulation of encoding-related EMs or, gaze reinstatement. Participants reinstated encoding-related EMs following degraded retrieval cues and this reinstatement was negatively correlated with accuracy for lure images, suggesting that retrieval of existing representations (i.e., pattern completion) underlies lure false alarms. Our findings provide novel evidence linking gaze reinstatement and pattern completion and advance a functional role for EMs in memory retrieval.",

We used a systems-physiology approach to investigate diet-induced effects on maternal gut microbes and folate/inositol transport in the maternal/fetal gut and placenta. Female mice were fed a control diet (CON) diet, undernourished (UN, restricted by 30% of CON intake) or a high fat diet (HF, 60% kcals fat) during pregnancy to model normal pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, or maternal metabolic dysfunction, respectively. At gestational day 18.5 we assessed circulating folate levels by microbiological assay, relative abundance of gut lactobacilli by G3PhyloChipTM, and folate/inositol transporters in placenta and maternal/fetal gut by qPCR/immunohistochemistry. UN and HF-fed mothers had lower plasma folate concentrations vs. CON. Relative abundance of three lactobacilli taxa were higher in HF vs. UN and CON. HF-fed mothers had higher gut proton coupled folate transporter (Pcft) and reduced folate carrier 1 (Rfc1), and lower sodium myo-inositol co-transporter 2 (Smit2), mRNA expression vs. UN and CON. HF placentae had increased folate receptor beta (Fr\u03b2) expression vs. UN. mRNA expression of Pcft, folate receptor alpha (Fr\u03b1) and Smit2 was higher in gut of HF fetuses vs. UN and CON. Transporter protein expression was not different between groups. Maternal malnutrition alters abundance of select gut microbes and folate/inositol transporters, which may influence maternal micronutrient status and delivery to the fetus, impacting pregnancy/fetal outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Length of pre-miRNA, minimal free energy (MFE), and number of stacks show bigger difference between different species, and this means that such features tend to be species-specific. In order to discover differences and similarities among species based on numeric features of miRNAs, we design two tools-species difference map and feature difference map. By species difference map, we find that numeric features of miRNAs can represent class attribute of species and the map basically describe relationship between different species. By feature difference map, we find that there are huge difference about difference of every numeric feature between different species, and this means that strength of such difference is not uniform. Meantime, it means that numeric feature of miRNAs can represent different attributes of corresponding species. Our study present relationship between different species by brand new style-numeric features of miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "The human immune system relies on highly complex and diverse transcripts and the proteins they encode. These include transcripts for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and II receptors which are essential for self/non-self discrimination by the immune system as well as transcripts encoding B cell and T cell receptors (BCR and TCR) which recognize, bind, and help eliminate foreign antigens.\\n\\nHLA genes are highly diverse within the human population with each individual possessing two of thousands of different alleles in each of the 9 major HLA genes. Determining which combination of alleles an individual possesses for each HLA gene (high-resolution HLA-typing) is essential to establish donor-recipient compatibility in organ and bone-marrow transplantations. BCR and TCR genes in turn are generated by recombining a diverse set of gene segments on the DNA level in each maturing B and T cell, respectively. This process generates adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR) of composed of unique transcripts expressed by each B and T cells. These repertoires carry a vast amount of health relevant information. Both short-read RNA-seq based HLA-typing1 and adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing2-5 currently rely heavily on our incomplete knowledge of the genetic diversity at HLA6 and BCR/TCR loci7,8.\\n\\nHere we used our nanopore sequencing based Rolling Circle to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) protocol9 to generate over 10,000,000 full-length cDNA sequences at a median accuracy of 97.9%.

    "abstract": "A Th2 immune response is central to allergic airway inflammation, which afflicts millions worldwide. However, the mechanisms that augment GATA3 expression in an antigen-primed developing Th2 cell are not well understood. Here, we describe an unexpected role for Blimp-1, a transcriptional repressor that constrains autoimmunity, as an upstream promoter of GATA3 expression that is critical for Th2 cell development in the lung, but dispensable for TFH function and IgE production. Mechanistically, Blimp-1 acts through Bcl6, which is necessary to drive GATA3 expression. Surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-21, is required via STAT3 activation to upregulate Blimp-1 and promote Th2 cell development. These data reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for an IL-10-STAT3-Blimp-1 circuit as an initiator of an inflammatory Th2 response in the lung to allergens. Thus, Blimp-1 in a context-dependent fashion can drive inflammation by promoting rather than terminating effector T cell responses.\n\nSummaryThe transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 acts via a pro-inflammatory IL-10-STAT3 axis as a critical positive regulator of Th2 cells in the lung in response to allergens driving pathophysiology associated with asthma disease.",

However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks as well as the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to which extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a fine-grained topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and non-topographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and improve the detection of a reproductive pheromone, when presented together with competing complex olfactory cues, by boosting the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data shows a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryThe mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS) supports social and reproductive behavior through the sensation of environmental chemosignals. A growing number of excreted steroids have been shown to be potent AOS cues, including bile acids (BAs) found in feces. As is still the case with most AOS ligands, the specific receptors used by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) to detect BAs remain unknown. To identify VSN BA receptors, we first performed a deep analysis of VSN BA tuning using volumetric GCaMP6f/s Ca2+ imaging. These experiments revealed both broadly and narrowly tuned populations of BA-receptive VSNs with sub-micromolar sensitivities. We then developed a new physiology-forward approach for identifying AOS ligand-receptor interactions, which we call Fluorescence Live Imaging for Cell Capture and RNA-seq, or FLICCR-seq. FLICCR-seq analysis revealed 5 specific V1R-family receptors enriched in BA-sensitive VSNs. These studies introduce a powerful new approach for ligand-receptor matching and reveal biological mechanisms underlying mammalian BA chemosensation.",

At present, however, little is known about the roles of different hippocampal subfields in supporting this item-context binding. To address this question, we constructed a task in which items were affiliated with differing types of context - cognitive associations that vary at the local, item level and membership in temporally organized lists that linked items together at a global level. Participants made item recognition judgments while undergoing high-resolution fMRI imaging. We performed voxel pattern similarity analyses to answer the question of how human hippocampal subfields represent retrieved information about cognitive states and the time at which a past event took place. As participants recollected previously presented items, activity patterns in the CA23DG subregion carried information about prior cognitive states associated with these items. We found no evidence to suggest reinstatement of information about temporal context at the level of list membership, but exploratory analyses revealed representations of temporal context at a coarse level in conjunction with representations of cognitive contexts. Results are consistent with characterizations of CA23DG as a critical site for binding together items and contexts in the service of memory retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic and biotic factors are known to be key in limiting the geographical distribution of species. However, our understanding on the influence of habitat heterogeneity on ecological interactions and behavior in tropical animals is limited. We studied groups of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus flavigula) in urban and rural areas in northern South America to understand how habitat and resource requirements (food storage structures) influences patterns of distribution across the Aburra Valley, in the northern area of the Central Andes of Colombia. Using focal observations of 10 different groups over nearly a two-year period, we estimated territory size, habitat use, and described the use and presence of granaries. We found that territory size, tree diversity, and the use of granaries varied among groups. Accordingly, Acorn Woodpeckers use a wide variety of tree species to make cavities, to feed and to build granaries for social interactions. Our study supports the hypothesis that Acorn Woodpeckers do not rely on the Colombian Oak (Quercus humboldtii Bonpl.) for feeding, nesting or foraging in the Aburra Valley, and that the construction of granaries to store food is present in urban populations, despite the lack of strong seasonal changes in tropical areas. We suggest that the distribution of the Acorn Woodpecker in our study area is strongly associated with one particular species of tree, Albizia carbonaria Britton, and the behavior of granaries construction might be hardwired in this species for the maintenance and cohesion of family groups.",

In rod-shaped Escherichia coli, two conserved sets of machinery are essential for cell-wall insertion in the cylindrical part of the cell, the Rod complex and the class-A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs). While the Rod complex governs rod-like cell shape, aPBP function is less well understood. aPBPs were previously hypothesized to either work in concert with the Rod complex or to independently repair cell-wall defects. First, we demonstrate through modulation of enzyme levels that class-A PBPs do not contribute to rod-like cell shape but are required for mechanical stability, supporting their independent activity. By combining measurements of cell-wall stiffness, cell-wall insertion, and PBP1b motion at the single-molecule level we then demonstrate that PBP1b, the major class-A PBP, contributes to cell-wall integrity by localizing and inserting peptidoglycan in direct response to local cell-wall defects.",

A related, but much less studied question is whether people also have control over the total amount of VWM resource allocated to a task. Here, we approach this question by testing whether increasing monetary incentives results in better overall VWM performance. In three experiments, subjects performed a delayed-estimation task on the Amazon Turk platform. In the first two experiments, four groups of subjects received a bonus payment based on their performance, with the maximum bonus ranging from $0 to $10 between groups. We found no effect of the amount of bonus on intrinsic motivation or on VWM performance in either experiment. In the third experiment, reward was manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis using a within-subjects design. Again, no evidence was found that VWM performance depended on the magnitude of potential reward. These results suggest that encoding quality in visual working memory is insensitive to monetary reward, which has implications for resource-rational theories of VWM.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-based inhibitors hold great potential for targeted modulation of intracellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by leveraging vast chemical space relative to primary structure via sequence diversity as well as conformationally through varying secondary and tertiary structures. However, the development of peptide therapeutics has been hindered because of their limited conformational stability, proteolytic sensitivity and cell permeability. Several contemporary peptide design strategies address these issues to varying degrees. Strategic macrocyclization through optimally placed chemical braces such as olefinic hydrocarbon crosslinks, commonly referred to as staples, may address these issues by i) restricting conformational freedom to improve target affinities, ii) improving proteolytic resistance, and iii) enhancing cell permeability. Conversely, molecules constructed entirely from D-amino acids are hyper-resistant to proteolytic cleavage, but generally lack conformational stability and membrane permeability. Since neither approach is a complete solution, we have combined these strategies to identify the first examples of all-D -helical stapled and stitched peptides. As a template, we used a recently reported all D-linear peptide that is a potent inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2 interaction, but is devoid of cellular activity. To design both stapled and stitched all-D-peptide analogues, we used computational modelling to predict optimal staple placement. The resultant novel macrocyclic all D-peptide was determined to exhibit increased -helicity, improved target binding, complete proteolytic stability and, most notably, cellular activity.",

The effect of such intra-specific trait variability (ITV) on the stability, coexistence and diversity of ecological communities received considerable attention and in many models it was shown to impede coexistence and decrease species diversity. Here we present a numerical study of the effect of genetically inherited ITV on species persistence and diversity in a temporally fluctuating environment. Two mechanisms are identified. First, ITV buffers populations against varying environmental conditions (portfolio effect) and reduces abundance variations. Second, the interplay between ITV and environmental variations tends to increase the mean fitness of diverse populations. The first mechanism promotes persistence and tends to increase species richness, while the second reduces the chance of a rare species population (which is usually homogenous) to invade and decreases species richness. We show that for large communities the portfolio effect is dominant, leading to ITV promoting species persistence and richness.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEA fundamental goal of the auditory system is to parse the auditory environment into distinct perceptual representations. Auditory perception is mediated by the ventral auditory pathway, which includes the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) late. Because large-scale recordings of auditory signals are quite rare, the spatiotemporal resolution of the neuronal code that underlies vlPFCs contribution to auditory perception has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we developed a modular, chronic, high-resolution, multi-electrode array system with long-term viability.\\n\\nAPPROACHWe molded three separate ECoG arrays into one and implanted this system in a non-human primate. A custom 3D-printed titanium chamber was mounted on left hemisphere. The molded 294-contact ECoG array was implanted subdurally over vlPFC. ECoG activity was recorded while the monkey participated in a \\\"hearing-in-noise\\\" task in which they reported hearing a \\\"target\\\" vocalization from a background \\\"chorus\\\" of vocalizations. We titrated task difficulty by varying the sound level of the target vocalization, relative to the chorus (target-to-chorus ratio, TCr).\\n\\nMAIN RESULTSWe decoded the TCr and the monkeys behavioral choices from the ECoG signal. We analyzed decoding capacity as a function of neuronal frequency band, spatial resolution, and time from implantation. Over a one-year period, we were successfully able to record ECoG signals. Although we found significant decoding with as few as two electrodes, we found near-perfect decoding with [~]16 electrodes. Decoding further improved when we included more electrodes. Finally, because the decoding capacity of individual electrodes varied on a day-by-day basis, high-density electrode arrays ensure robust decoding in the long term.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEOur results demonstrate the utility and robustness of high-resolution chronic {micro}ECoG recording. We developed a new high-resolution surface electrode array that can be scaled to cover larger cortical areas without increasing the chamber footprint.",

The entire tRNAPhe was sequenced and the identity, location and abundance of all 11 base modifications were determined. Changes in ratios of wybutosine and its depurinated form under different conditions were quantified, pointing to the ability of our technology to determine dynamic changes of nucleotide modifications. Two truncated isoforms at 3CCA tail of the tRNAPhe (75 nt CC, 80% and 74 nt C, 3%) were identified in addition to the 76 nt tRNAPhe with a full-length 3CCA tail (17%). We also discovered a new isoform with A-G transitions at both the 44 and 45 positions in the tRNAPhe variable loop.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryDirect 2D-HELS-AA MS Seq of tRNA reveals different isoforms and base modifications",

    "abstract": "The Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinases are part of large group of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that play important roles in cell differentiation and organism development. Animal RAF kinases are key connectors in the signaling cascade that links the small G protein RAS and the Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation pathway. Mutations in the RAF genes have been linked to a number of cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, and ovarian cancer. Most animals possess a single RAF gene, but vertebrates have three RAF genes in their genomes, named as A-, B-, and C-RAF, the latter also known as RAF-1. The emergence of the multiple copies of vertebrate RAFs is not well resolved, on the one hand, because of sequence and functional similarities, some authors speculate that vertebrate B-Raf is most closely related to the RAF genes of the fruit fly and Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas a competing hypothesis is that the A-, B- and C-RAF paralogs emerged from the two rounds of whole genome duplications that occurred early in the evolution of vertebrates. We applied a comparative approach grounded in synteny and phylogenetic analyses to evaluate these two scenarios. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the RAF genes of vertebrates are paralogs generated by whole genome duplications. Thus, the functional similarities between vertebrate B-RAF and invertebrate RAF probably reflect the retention of ancestral characters. Interestingly, data from the literature indicate that B-RAF is the paralog that associated with cancer more strongly, and also yields the most severe phenotypes when knocked out.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization between species can affect the strength of the reproductive barriers that separate those species. Two extensions of this effect are: (1) the expectation that asymmetric hybridization will have asymmetric effects on reproductive barrier strength and (2) the expectation that local hybridization will affect only local reproductive barrier strength and could therefore alter within-species compatibility. We tested these hypotheses in a pair of morning glory species that exhibit asymmetric gene flow from highly selfing Ipomoea lacunosa into mixed mating I. cordatotriloba in regions where they co-occur. Because of the direction of this gene flow, we predicted that reproductive barrier strength would be more strongly affected in I. cordatotriloba than I. lacunosa. We also predicted that changes to reproductive barriers in sympatric I. cordatotriloba populations would affect compatibility with allopatric populations of that species. We tested these predictions by measuring the strength of a reproductive barrier to seed set across the species ranges. Consistent with our first prediction, we found that sympatric and allopatric I. lacunosa produce the same number of seeds in crosses with I. cordatotriloba, whereas crosses between sympatric I. cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa are more successful than crosses between allopatric I. cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa. This difference in compatibility appears to reflect an asymmetric decrease in the strength of the barrier to seed set in sympatric I. cordatotriloba, which could be caused by I. lacunosa alleles that have introgressed into I. cordatotriloba. We further demonstrated that changes to sympatric I. cordatotriloba have decreased its ability to produce seeds with allopatric populations of the same species, in line with our second prediction. Thus, in a manner analogous to cascade reinforcement, we suggest that introgression associated with hybridization not only influences between-species isolation but can also contribute to isolation within a species.\n\nImpact StatementBiological diversity depends on traits that prevent different species from successfully interbreeding. However, these reproductive barriers are often imperfect, leading to hybrid matings and possible genetic exchange between species where they occur together. When this happens, the reproductive barriers that separate species can themselves evolve to become stronger or weaker. Understanding the effects of hybridization on reproductive barriers is key to predicting the potential for future hybridization between species and ultimately whether hybridizing species will diverge, persist, or merge in regions where they co-occur. Here we hypothesize and show that hybridization in only one direction causes unidirectional changes to reproductive barrier strength and that geographically restricted hybridization causes local changes to barrier strength that can affect interbreeding within a species. Specifically, we found that gene flow from one species of morning glory into another likely caused a reproductive barrier to decrease in regions where they co-occur. The decreased reproductive barrier is caused by changes in only the species that received gene flow. We also found that the locally reduced barriers in the species that received gene flow affected reproductive compatibility between populations within that species. Thus, a breakdown of barriers between species can cause a build-up of barriers within a species. Our work demonstrates critical and rarely explored interactions at species boundaries.",

CaMKII is a widely expressed enzyme whose activation by oxidation of regulatory domain methionines (ox-CaMKII) contributes to cardiovascular disease, asthma, and cancer. Here we integrate comparative genomic and experimental data to show that CaMKII activation by ROS arose more than half-a-billion years ago on the vertebrate stem lineage where it constituted a bridge between ROS and increased intracellular Ca2+ release, exercise responsive gene transcription, and improved performance in skeletal muscle. These enhancements to fight-or-flight physiology were likely key in facilitating a well-evidenced shift in the behavioural ecology of our immediate chordate ancestors, and, in turn, the evolutionary success of vertebrates. Still, the ox-CaMKII innovation for augmenting performance must be considered a critical evolutionary trade-off, as it rendered us more susceptible to common and often fatal diseases linked to excessive ROS.",

    "abstract": "A major function of the gut microbiota is to provide colonization resistance, wherein pathogens are inhibited or suppressed below infectious level. However, the fraction of gut microbiota required for colonization resistance remains unclear. We used culturomics to isolate a gut microbiota culture collection comprising 1590 isolates belonging to 102 species. Estimated by metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples used for culture, this culture collection represents 50.73% of taxonomic diversity and 70% functional capacity. Using whole genome sequencing we characterized species representatives from this collection, and predicted their phenotypic traits, further characterizing isolates by defining nutrient utilization profile and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. When screened using a co-culture assay, 66 species in our culture collection inhibited C. difficile. Several phenotypes, particularly, growth rate, production of SCFAs, and the utilization of mannitol, sorbitol or succinate correlated with C. difficile inhibition. We used a combinatorial community assembly approach to formulate defined bacterial mixes inhibitory to C. difficile. When 256 combinations were tested, we found both species composition and blend size to be important in inhibition. Our results show that the interaction of bacteria with each other in a mix and with other members of gut commensals must be investigated for designing defined bacterial mixes for inhibiting C. difficile in vivo.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic treatment causes instability of gut microbiota and the loss of colonization resistance, allowing pathogens such as C. difficile to colonize, causing recurrent infection and mortality. Although fecal microbiome transplantation has shown to be an effective treatment for C. difficile infection (CDI), a more desirable approach would be the use of a defined mix of inhibitory gut bacteria. C. difficile-inhibiting species and bacterial combinations we identify herein improve our understanding of the ecological interactions controlling colonization resistance against C. difficile, and could aid the design of defined bacteriotherapy as a non-antibiotic alternative against CDI.",

    "abstract": "Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.\n\nAuthor summaryDivisive normalization (DN) is a computational building block throughout sensory processing in the brain. We currently lack an understanding of what role this normalization mechanism plays when processing complex stimuli like natural images. Here, we use modern machine learning methods to build a general DN model that is directly informed by data from primary visual cortex (V1). Contrary to high-predictive deep learning models, our DN-based models parameters offer a straightforward interpretation of the nature of normalization. Within the receptive field, we found that neurons responding strongly to a specific orientation are preferentially normalized by other neurons that are highly active for similar orientations, rather than being normalized by all neurons as it is currently assumed by textbook models.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPeripubertal exposure to the phthalate metabolite mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) in rodents causes testicular inflammation, spermatocyte apoptosis, and disruption of the blood-testis barrier. The MEHP-induced inflammation response includes an infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils to the testes, although the cause and purpose of this response is unknown. Recently, a population of testicular macrophages phenotypically distinct from those resident in the interstitium was described in mice. Testicular peritubular macrophages aggregate near the spermatogonial stem cell niche and are believed to stimulate their differentiation. We hypothesized that if testicular peritubular macrophages do indeed stimulate spermatogonial differentiation, MEHP exposure would result in an increase of peritubular macrophages to stimulate the replacement of lost spermatocytes. Male rats were exposed to 700 mg/kg MEHP or corn oil (vehicle control) via oral gavage at PND 28 and euthanized at 48 hours, 1 week, or 2 weeks later. Tubules were stained with immunofluorescent markers for macrophages and undifferentiated spermatogonia. Peritubular macrophages were observed in rat testis similar to those previously described in mice: MHC-II+ cells on the surface of seminiferous tubules with heterogeneous morphology. Quantification of MHC-II+ cells revealed that, unlike in the mouse, their numbers did not increase through puberty. MEHP increased macrophage presence by six-fold 48-hours after exposure and remained elevated by two-fold two weeks after exposure. An increase of differentiating spermatogonia occurred two weeks after MEHP exposure. Taken together, our results suggest that peritubular macrophages play a crucial role in the testis response to acute injury and the subsequent recovery of spermatogenesis.\\n\\nSummary SentencePhthalate-induced testicular injury results in an increase of specialized peritubular macrophages that may assist in the recovery of spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Intragenesis is an important alternative to transgenesis to produce modified plants containing native DNA only. A key point to develop such a strategy is the availability of regulatory sequences controlling the expression of the gene of interest. With the aim of finding apple gene promoters either inducible by the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora (Ea) or moderately constitutive, we focused on polyphenoloxidase genes (PPO). These genes encode oxidative enzymes involved in many physiological processes and have been previously shown to be up-regulated during the Ea infection process. We found ten PPO and two PPO-like sequences in the apple genome and characterized the promoters of MdPPO16 (pPPO16) and MdKFDV02 PPO-like (pKFDV02) for their potential as Ea-inducible and low-constitutive regulatory sequences respectively. Expression levels of reporter genes fused to these promoters and transiently or stably expressed in apple were quantified after various treatments. Unlike pKFDV02 which displayed a variable activity, pPPO16 allowed a fast and strong expression of transgenes in apple following Ea infection in a Type 3 Secretion System dependent manner. Altogether our results indicate that pKFDV02 did not keep its promises as a constitutive and weak promoter whereas pPPO16, the first Ea-inducible promoter cloned from apple, can be a useful component of intragenic strategies to create fire blight resistant apple genotypes.\n\nKey messagepPPO16, the first Ea-inducible promoter cloned from apple, can be a useful component of intragenic strategies to create fire blight resistant apple genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Active implantable microscale reservoir-based drug delivery systems enabled novel and effective drug delivery concepts for both systemic and localized drug delivery applications. These systems typically consist of a drug reservoir and an active pumping mechanism for precise delivery of drugs. Here we present a stand-alone, refillable, scalable, and fully implantable microreservoir platform to be integrated with micropumps as a storing component of active implantable drug delivery microsystems. The microreservoir was fabricated with 3D-printing technology, enabling miniature, scalable, and planar structure, optimized for subcutaneous implantation especially in small animals (e.g., mouse), while being readily scalable for larger animals and human translation. Three different capacities of the microreservoir (1 L, 10 L, and 100 L) were fabricated and characterized all with 3 mm thickness. The microreservoir consists of two main parts: a cavity for long-term drug storage with an outlet microtubing (250 m OD, 125 m ID), and a refill port for transcutaneous refills through a septum. The cavity membrane is fabricated with thin Parylene-C layers using a polyethylene glycol sacrificial layer, minimizing restoring force and hence backflow, as fluid is discharged. This feature enables integration to normally-open mechanisms and improves pumping efficiency when integrated to normally-closed pumps. The results of in vitro optimization and characterization of the cavity membrane show 95% extraction percentage of the cavity with insignificant (2%) backflow due to restoring force of the membrane. The refill port septum thickness is minimized down to 1 mm by a novel pre-compression concept, while capable of ~65000 injections with 30 Ga non-coring needles without leakage under 100 kPa (4x greater than physiological backpressure). To demonstrate integrability of the microreservoir to an active micropump, the 10 L microreservoir was integrated to a micropump recently developed in our laboratory, making an implantable drug delivery microsystem. Two different microsystems were subcutaneously implanted in two mice, and the outlet microtubing was implanted into the round window membrane niche for infusion of a known ototoxic compound (sodium salicylate) at 50 nL/min for 20 min. Real-time shifts in distortion product otoacoustic emission thresholds and amplitudes were measured during the infusion. The in vivo results show a mean shift of 22.1 dB after 20 min for the most basal region, matching with syringe pump results. A biocompatibility experiment was performed on the microsystem for six months to assess design and fabrication suitability for chronic subcutaneous implantation and clinical translational development. The results demonstrate very favorable signs of biocompatibility for long-term implantation. Although tested here on mice for a specific inner ear application, this low-cost design and fabrication methodology is scalable for use in larger animals and human for different applications/delivery sites.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic organisms have evolved mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of cells bearing genetic aberrations. This is especially crucial for the germline, because fecundity, and fitness of progeny would be adversely affected by an excessively high mutational incidence. The process of meiosis poses unique problems for mutation avoidance, due to the requirement for SPO11-induced programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) in recombination-driven pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Mouse meiocytes bearing unrepaired meiotic DSBs or unsynapsed chromosomes are eliminated before completing meiotic prophase I. In previous work, we showed that checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2; CHEK2), a canonical DNA damage response protein, is crucial for eliminating not only oocytes defective in meiotic DSB repair (e.g. Trip13Gt mutants), but also asynaptic Spo11-/- oocytes that accumulate a threshold level of spontaneous DSBs. However, rescue of such oocytes by Chk2 deficiency was incomplete, raising the possibility that a parallel checkpoint pathway(s) exists. Here, we show that mouse oocytes lacking both TAp63 and TRP53 protects nearly all Spo11-/- and Trip13Gt/Gt oocytes from elimination. We present evidence that checkpoint kinase I (CHK1; CHEK1), which is known to signal to TRP53, also becomes activated by persistent DSBs in oocytes, and to an increased degree when CHK2 is absent. The combined data indicate that nearly all oocytes reaching a threshold level of unrepaired DSBs are eliminated by a semi-redundant pathway of CHK1/CHK2 signaling to TRP53/TAp63.",

Many Paenibacillus species are known to be engaged in complex bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions, which in other species were shown to necessitate quorum sensing communication. However, to date no quorum sensing systems have been described in Paenibacillus. Here we show that the type strain P. polymyxa ATCC 842 encodes at least 16 peptide-based communication systems. Each of these systems is comprised of a pro-peptide that is secreted to the growth medium and processed to generate a mature short peptide. Each peptide has a cognate intracellular receptor of the RRNPP family, and we show that external addition of P. polymyxa communication peptides leads to reprogramming of the transcriptional response. We found that these quorum sensing systems are conserved across hundreds of species belonging to the Paenibacillaceae family, with some species encoding more than 25 different peptide-receptor pairs, representing a record number of quorum sensing systems encoded in a single genome.",

    "abstract": "When a neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with an appetitive reward, two different types of conditioned approach responses may develop: a sign-tracking response directed toward the neutral cue, or a goal-tracking response directed toward the location of impending reward delivery. Sign-tracking responses have been postulated to result from attribution of incentive value to conditioned cues, while goal-tracking reflects the assignment of only predictive value to the cue. We therefore hypothesized that sign-tracking would be more sensitive to manipulations of incentive value, while goal-tracking would be more responsive to changes in the predictive value of the cue. We tested sign- and goal-tracking before and after devaluation of a food reward using lithium chloride, and tested whether either response could be learned under negative contingency conditions that precluded any serendipitous reinforcement of the behavior that might support instrumental learning. We also tested the effects on sign- and goal-tracking of blocking the predictive value of a cue using simultaneous presentation of a pre-conditioned cue. We found that sign-tracking was sensitive to outcome devaluation, while goal-tracking was not. We also confirmed that both responses are Pavlovian because they can be learned under negative contingency conditions. Goal-tracking was completely blocked by a pre-conditioned cue, while sign-tracking was only partially reduced. These results indicate that sign- and goal-tracking follow different rules of reinforcement learning and suggest a need to revise current models of associative learning to account for these differences.",

    "abstract": "Extended phenotypes are traits that exist outside the physical body of the organism. Despite their potential role in the lives of both the organisms that express them and other organisms that can be influenced by extended phenotypes, the consistency and covariance with morphological and behaviour traits of extended phenotypes is rarely evaluated, especially in wild organisms. We repeatedly measured an extended phenotype that directly influences an organisms prey acquisition, the web structure, of wild orb-weaving spiders (Micrathena vigorsii), which re-build their webs each day. We related web structure traits to behavioural traits and body size (length). Both web diameter and web density were repeatably different among individuals, while reaction to a predation threat was slightly so, but response to a prey stimulus and web symmetry were not. There was a syndrome between morphology and web structure traits, where larger spiders spun webs that were wider, had webs with increased thread spacing, and the spider tended to react more slowly to a predation threat. When a spider built a relatively larger web it was also relatively a less dense and less symmetrical web. The repeatability of web construction and relationship with spider body size we found may be common features of intra-population variation in web structure in spiders. Individual variation along the morphology and web structure syndrome could represent variation in individual foraging strategies, or age-based correlated changes. By estimating the consistency and covariances of extended phenotypes we can begin to evaluate what maintains their variation and how they might evolve.",

    "abstract": "In single-molecule localization based super-resolution microscopy (SMLM), a fluorophore stochastically switches between fluorescent- and dark-states, leading to intermittent emission of fluorescence, a phenomenon known as blinking. Intermittent emissions create multiple localizations belonging to the same molecule, resulting in blinking-artifacts within SMLM images. These artifacts are often interpreted as true biological assemblies, confounding quantitative analyses and interpretations. Multiple methods have been developed to eliminate these artifacts, but they either require additional experiments, arbitrary thresholds, or specific photo-kinetic models. Here we present a method, termed Distance Distribution Correction (DDC), to eliminate blinking-caused repeat localizations without any additional calibrations. The approach relies on the finding that the true pairwise distance distribution of different fluorophores in an SMLM image can be naturally obtained from the imaging sequence by using distances between localizations separated by a time much longer than the average fluorescence survival time. We show that using the true pairwise distribution we can define and then maximize the likelihood of obtaining a particular set of localizations void of blinking-artifacts, generating an accurate reconstruction of the underlying cellular structure. Using both simulated and experimental data, we show that DDC surpasses all previous existing blinking-artifact correction methodologies, resulting in drastic improvements in obtaining the closest estimate of the true spatial organization and number of fluorescent emitters in a wide range of applications. The simplicity and robustness of DDC will allow it to become the field standard in SMLM imaging, enabling the most accurate reconstruction and quantification of SMLM images to date.",

Independently, many of these factors are known to play an important role in, but not fully define, the compatibility between the model snail B. glabrata, and S. mansoni. Here, we demonstrate association between four, previously characterized humoral immune molecules; BgFREP3, BgTEP1, BgFREP2 and Biomphalysin. We also identify unique immune determinants in the plasma of S. mansoni-resistant B. glabrata that explain the incompatible phenotype. These factors coordinate to initiate haemocyte-mediated deestruction of S. mansoni sporocysts via production of reactive oxygen species. The inclusion of BgFREP2 in a BgFREP3-initiated complex that also includes BgTEP1 almost completely explains resistance to S. mansoni in this model. Our study unifies many independent lines of investigation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the snail immune system in the context of infection by this important human parasite.",

Through recruiting {beta}Heavy-Spectrin and MyosinV to the apical membrane, Crumbs maintains the Rab6-, Rab11- and Rab30-dependent trafficking and regulates the lipid phosphatases Pten and Ocrl. Crumbs knock-down results in increased apical levels of PI(4,5)P2 and formation of a novel, Moesin- and PI(4,5)P2-enriched apical membrane sac containing microvilli-like structures.

    "abstract": "Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigms are used to characterize the nature of motivational behaviors in response to stimuli as either directed toward the cue (i.e., sign-tracking) or the site of reward delivery (i.e., goal-tracking). Recent evidence has shown that activity of the endocannabinoid system increases dopaminergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic system, and other studies have shown that sign-tracking behaviors are dependent on dopamine. Therefore, we hypothesized that administration of a cannabinoid agonist would increase sign-tracking and decrease goal-tracking behaviors. Forty-seven adult male Sprague Dawley rats were given a low, medium, or high dose of the cannabinoid agonist CP-55,940 (N=12 per group) or saline (N=11) before Pavlovian conditioned approach training. A separate group of rats (N=32) were sacrificed after PCA training for measurement of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) using in situ hybridization. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, CP-55,940 dose-dependently decreased sign-tracking and increased goal-tracking behavior. CB1 expression was higher in sign-trackers compared to goal-trackers in the prelimbic cortex, but there were no significant differences in CB1 or FAAH expression in the infralimbic cortex, dCA1, dCA3, dorsal dentate gyrus, or amygdala. These results demonstrate that cannabinoid signaling can specifically influence behavioral biases toward sign- or goal-tracking. Pre-existing differences in CB1 expression patterns, particularly in the prelimbic cortex, could contribute to individual differences in the tendency to attribute incentive salience to reward cues.",

    "abstract": "Logopenic Progressive Aphasia (LPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome characterised by sentence repetition and naming difficulties arising from left-lateralised temporoparietal atrophy. Clinical descriptions of LPA largely concentrate on profiling language deficits, however, accumulating evidence points to the presence of cognitive deficits, even on tasks with minimal language demands. Although non-linguistic cognitive deficits in LPA are thought to scale with disease severity, patients at discrete stages of language dysfunction display overlapping cognitive profiles, suggesting individual-level variation in cognitive performance, independent of primary language dysfunction. To address this issue, we used principal component analysis to decompose individual-level variation in cognitive performance in 43 well-characterised LPA patients who underwent multi-domain neuropsychological assessments and structural neuroimaging. The principal component analysis solution revealed the presence of two, statistically independent factors, providing stable and clinically intuitive explanations for the majority of variance in cognitive performance in the syndrome. Factor 1 reflected  speech production and verbal memory deficits which typify LPA. Systematic variations were also confirmed on a second, orthogonal factor mainly comprising visuospatial and executive processes. Adopting a case-comparison approach, we further demonstrate that pairs of patients with comparable Factor 1 scores, regardless of their severity, diverge considerably on visuo-executive test performance, underscoring the inter-individual variability in cognitive profiles in comparably  logopenic patients. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that speech production and verbal memory factor scores correlated with left middle frontal gyrus, while visuospatial and executive factor scores were associated with grey matter intensity of right-lateralised temporoparietal, middle frontal regions and their underlying white matter connectivity. Importantly, LPA patients with poorer visuospatial and executive factor scores demonstrated greater right-lateralised temporoparietal and frontal atrophy. Our findings demonstrate the inherent variation in cognitive performance at an individual- and group-level in LPA, suggesting the presence of a genuine co-occurring cognitive impairment that is independent of language function and disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory GABA-ergic neurotransmission is fundamental for the adult vertebrate central nervous system and requires low chloride ion concentration in neurons. This basic ionic-homeostatic mechanism relies on expression and function of KCC2, a neuroprotective ionic transporter that extrudes neuronal chloride. Importantly, no other transporter can rescue KCC2 deficit, and attenuated expression of KCC2 is strongly associated with circuit malfunction in chronic pain, epilepsy, neuro-degeneration, neuro-trauma, and other neuro-psychiatric illnesses. To isolate Kcc2 gene expression-enhancing compounds, we screened 1057 cell growth-regulating compounds in cultured primary cortical neurons. We identified kenpaullone (KP), which enhanced Kcc2/KCC2 expression and function in cultured rodent and human neurons by inhibiting GSK3{beta}. KP effectively reduced pathologic pain in preclinical mouse models of nerve constriction injury and bone cancer. In nerve-injury pain, KP restored Kcc2 expression and GABA-evoked chloride reversal potential in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Delta-catenin, a phosphorylation-target of GSK3{beta} in neurons, activated the Kcc2 promoter via Kaiso transcription factor. Validating this new pathway in-vivo, transient spinal over-expression of delta-catenin mimicked KP analgesia. With relevance for pathologic pain, our discoveries of a newly repurposed compound and a novel genetically-encoded mechanism that each enhance Kcc2 gene expression enable us to re-normalize disrupted inhibitory neurotransmission through genetic re-programming.",

    "abstract": "Land colonization was a major event in the history of life. Among animals, insects exerted a staggering terrestrialization success, due to traits usually associated with post-embryonic life stages, while the egg stage has been largely overlooked in comparative studies. In many insects, after blastoderm differentiation, the extraembryonic serosal tissue wraps the embryo and synthesizes the serosal cuticle, an extracellular matrix that lies beneath the eggshell and protects the egg against water loss. In contrast, in non-insect hexapods such as springtails (Collembola) the early blastodermal cells synthesize a blastodermal cuticle. Here, we investigate the relationship between blastodermal cuticle formation and egg resistance to desiccation in the springtails Orchesella cincta and Folsomia candida, two species with different oviposition environments and developmental rates. The blastodermal cuticle becomes externally visible in O. cincta and F. candida at 22 and 29% of embryogenesis, respectively. To contextualize, we describe the stages of springtail embryogenesis, exemplified by F. candida. Our physiological assays then showed that blastodermal cuticle formation coincides with an increase in egg viability in a dry environment, significantly contributing to hatching success. However, protection differs between species: while O. cincta eggs survive at least 2 hours outside a humid environment, the survival period recorded for F. candida eggs is only 15 minutes, which correlates with this species\u2019 requirement for humid microhabitats. We suggest that the formation of this cuticle protects the eggs, constituting an ancestral trait among hexapods that predated and facilitated the process of terrestrialization that occurred during insect evolution.Research HighlightsThe formation of the blastodermal cuticle produced during early embryogenesis coincides with a higher protection against water loss in springtail (Collembola) eggs.Orchesella cincta eggs are more resistant to drought than Folsomia candida ones.The formation of a protective egg cuticle would be an ancestral trait among hexapods that facilitated their process of terrestrialization.Graphical AbstractGraphical Abstract legend: Eggs when laid uptake water but are also prone to water loss. Late eggs acquire some protection against water loss, but at different levels, depending on the species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) progression and myeloma-associated bone disease (MBD) are highly dependent on the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, in particular on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs from MM patients exhibit an abnormal transcriptional profile, suggesting that epigenetic alterations could be governing the tumor-promoting functions of MSCs and their prolonged osteoblast (OB) suppression in MM. In this study, we analyzed the DNA methylome of BM-derived MSCs from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma and symptomatic MM at diagnosis in comparison with their normal counterparts. DNA methylation alterations were found at each of the myeloma stage in association with deregulated expression levels of Homeobox genes involved in osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, these DNA methylation changes were recapitulated in vitro by exposing MSCs from healthy individuals to MM plasma cells. Pharmacological targeting of DNMTs and G9a with the dual inhibitor CM-272, reverted the expression of aberrantly methylated osteogenic regulators and promoted OB differentiation of MSCs from myeloma patients. Most importantly, in a mouse model of bone marrow-disseminated MM, administration of CM-272 prevented tumor-associated bone loss and reduced tumor burden. Our results demonstrated that not only was aberrant DNA methylation a main contributor to bone formation impairment found in MM patients, but also its targeting by CM-272 was able to reverse MM-associated bone loss.\\n\\nKEY POINTS- Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma and myeloma patients exhibit an aberrant DNA methylome compared to their healthy counterparts.\\n- These DNA methylation changes are associated with an altered expression of genes of the Homeobox loci that orchestrate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal precursors.\\n- MM plasma cell-exposed healthy MSCs recapitulate the DNA methylation alterations observed in MSCs isolated from myeloma patients.\\n- Dual targeting of DNMTs and the histone methyltransferase G9a with CM-272 not only controls MM tumor burden but also prevents myeloma-associated bone loss.",

    "abstract": "One-quarter of extant Eukaryotic species are herbivorous insects, yet the genomic basis of this extraordinary adaptive radiation is unclear. Recently-derived herbivorous species hold promise for understanding how colonization of living plant tissues shaped the evolution of herbivore genomes. Here, we characterized exceptional patterns of evolution coupled with a recent (<15 mya) transition to herbivory of mustard plants (Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis thaliana) in the fly genus Scaptomyza, nested within the paraphyletic genus Drosophila. We discovered a radiation of mustard-specialized Scaptomyza species, comparable in diversity to the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. Stable isotope, behavioral, and viability assays revealed these flies are obligate herbivores. Genome sequencing of one species, S. flava, revealed that the evolution of herbivory drove a contraction in gene families involved in chemosensation and xenobiotic metabolism. Against this backdrop of losses, highly targeted gains (\\\"blooms\\\") were found in Phase I and Phase II detoxification gene sub-families, including glutathione S-transferase (Gst) and cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) genes. S. flava has more validated paralogs of a single Cyp450 (N=6 for Cyp6g1) and Gst (N=5 for GstE5-8) than any other drosophilid. Functional studies of the Gst repertoire in S. flava showed that transcription of S. flava GstE5-8 paralogs was differentially regulated by dietary mustard oils, and of 22 heterologously expressed cytosolic S. flava GST enzymes, GSTE5-8 enzymes were exceptionally well-adapted to mustard oil detoxification in vitro. One, GSTE5-8a, was an order of magnitude more efficient at metabolizing mustard oils than GSTs from any other metazoan. The serendipitous intersection of two genetic model organisms, Drosophila and Arabidopsis, helped illuminate how an insect genome was remodeled during the evolutionary transformation to herbivory, identifying mechanisms that facilitated the evolution of the most diverse guild of animal life.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe origin of land plants >400 million years ago (mya) spurred the diversification of plant-feeding (herbivorous) insects and triggered an ongoing chemical co-evolutionary arms race. Because ancestors of most herbivorous insects first colonized plants >200 mya, the sands of time have buried evidence of how their genomes changed with their diet. We leveraged the serendipitous intersection of two genetic model systems: a close relative of yeast-feeding fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), the \\\"wasabi fly\\\" (Scaptomyza flava), that evolved to consume mustard plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. The yeast-to-mustard dietary transition remodeled the flys gene repertoire for sensing and detoxifying chemicals. Although many genes were lost, some underwent duplications that encode the most efficient detoxifying enzymes against mustard oils known from animals.",

    "abstract": "The global dissemination of a ciprofloxacin-resistant (cipR) S. sonnei clone outlines the mobility of this important agent of diarrheal disease, and threatens the utility of ciprofloxacin as a first-line antimicrobial for shigellosis. Here, we aimed to track the emergence of cipR S. sonnei in Vietnam to understand how novel antimicrobial resistant (AMR) Shigella clones become established in new locations. From 2014 to 2016, we isolated and genome sequenced 79 S. sonnei from children hospitalized with dysenteric diarrhea in southern Vietnam. The novel cipR S. sonnei clone displaced the resident ciprofloxacin-susceptible lineage while acquiring resistance against third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, and aminoglycosides. This process was not the result of a single clonal expansion, as we identified at least thirteen independent acquisitions of ESBL-encoding plasmids. The frequency and diversity of the variable AMR repertoire in an expanding clonal background of S. sonnei is unprecedented and we speculated that it was facilitated by horizontal gene transfer from commensal organisms in the human gut. Consequently, we characterized non-Shigella Enterobacteriaceae from Shigella-infected and healthy children by shotgun metagenomics. We identified a wide array of AMR genes and plasmids in the commensal Enterobacteriaceae, including an E. coli isolated from a Shigella-infected child with an identical ESBL plasmid to that characterized in the infecting S. sonnei. We confirmed that these AMR plasmids could be exchanged between commensal E. coli and S. sonnei and found that supplementation of ciprofloxacin into the conjugation media significantly increased the conjugation frequency of IncI/blaCTX-M-15, IncB/O/blaCTX-M-27 and IncF/blaCTX-M-27 plasmids. In a setting with high antimicrobial use and a high prevalence of AMR commensals, cipR S. sonnei may be propelled towards pan-resistance by adherence to outdated international treatment guidelines. Our work highlights the role of the gut microbiota in transferring resistance plasmids into enteric pathogens and provides essential data to restrict the use of ciprofloxacin globally.",

The critical first step in analysis is event detection, so called \"idealisation\", where noisy raw data are turned into discrete records of protein movement. To date there have been practical limitations in patch-clamp data idealisation; high quality idealisation is typically laborious and becomes infeasible and subjective with complex biological data containing many distinct native single ion channel proteins gating simultaneously. Here we show a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory architecture can automatically idealise complex single molecule activity more accurately and faster than traditional methods. There are no parameters to set; baseline, channel amplitude or numbers of channels for example. We believe this approach could revolutionise the unsupervised automatic detection of single-molecule transition events in the future.",

    "abstract": "Vaccine development for mutating pathogens is challenged by their fast evolution, the complexity of immunodominance, and the heterogeneous immune history of individuals. Mathematical models are critical for predicting successful vaccine conditions or designing potent antibodies. Existing models are limited by their abstract and poorly structural representations of antigen epitopes. Here, we propose a structural lattice-based model for antibody-antigen affinity. An efficient algorithm is given that predicts the best binding structure of an antibodys amino acid sequence around an antigen with shortened computational time. This structural representation contains key physiological properties, such as affinity jumps and cross-reactivity, and successfully reflects the topology of antigen epitopes, such as pockets and shielded residues. It is suitable for large simulations of affinity maturation. We perform in silico immunizations via germinal center simulations and show that our model can explain complex phenomena like recognition of the same epitope by unrelated clones. We show that the use of cocktails of similar epitopes promotes the development of cross-reactive antibodies. This model opens a new avenue for optimizing multivalent vaccines with combined antigen cocktails or sequential immunizations, and to reveal reasons for vaccine success or failure on a structural basis.",

Motion artefacts are an inevitable problem during such experiments and are routinely corrected for in x and y dimensions. However, axial (z) shifts of several microns can also occur, leading to intensity fluctuations in structures such as synapses that are small compared to the axial point-spread function of the microscope. Here we present a simple strategy to correct z-motion artefacts arising over the course of a time-series experiment in a single optical plane. Displacement in z was calculated using dye-filled blood vessels as an anatomical marker, providing high contrast images and accuracy to within [~]0.1 {micro}m. The axial profiles of ROIs corresponding to synapses were described using a Moffat function and this \\\"ROI-spread function\\\" used to correct activity traces on an ROI-by-ROI basis. We demonstrate the accuracy and utility of the procedures in simulation experiments using fluorescent beads and then apply them to correcting measurements of synaptic activity in populations of vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons expressing the synaptic reporter SyGCaMP6f. Correction of z-motion artefacts had a substantial impact on the apparent correlation between synaptic activity and running speed, demonstrating the importance of correcting for these artefacts for the interpretation of in vivo imaging experiments in awake mice.\\n\\nSummary of Key PointsO_LIMotion artefacts associated with motor behaviour are an inevitable problem of multiphoton imaging in awake behaving animals, particularly imaging synapses.\\nC_LIO_LICorrection of axial motion usually requires volumetric imaging resulting in slower rates of acquisition.\\nC_LIO_LIWe describe a method that is easy to implement to correct z-motion artefacts that allows population imaging of synaptic activity while scanning a single plane in a standard multiphoton microscope.\\nC_LIO_LIThe method uses a reference volume acquired in two colour channels - an activity reporter and an anatomical marker of blood vessels.

    "abstract": "The determination of individual cell trajectories through a high-dimensional cell-state space is an outstanding challenge, with relevance towards understanding biological changes ranging from cellular differentiation to epigenetic (adaptive) responses of diseased cells to drugging. We report on a combined experimental and theoretic method for determining the trajectories that specific highly plastic BRAFV600E mutant patient-derived melanoma cancer cells take between drug-naive and drug-tolerant states. Recent studies have implicated non-genetic, fast-acting resistance mechanisms are activated in these cells following BRAF inhibition. While single-cell highly multiplex omics tools can yield snapshots of the cell state space landscape sampled at any given time point, individual cell trajectories must be inferred from a kinetic series of snapshots, and that inference can be confounded by stochastic cell state switching. Using a microfludic-based single-cell integrated proteomic and metabolic assay, we assayed for a panel of signaling, phenotypic, and metabolic regulators at four time points during the first five days of drug treatment. Dimensional reduction of the resultant data set, coupled with information theoretic analysis, uncovered a complex cell state landscape and identified two distinct paths connecting drug-naive and drug-tolerant states. Cells are shown to exclusively traverse one of the two pathways depending on the level of the lineage restricted transcription factor MITF in the drug-naive cells. The two trajectories are associated with distinct signaling and metabolic susceptibilities, and are independently druggable.

We found that disrupting hub activity profoundly changed the function the default-mode network (DMN), and this change was associated with altered DMN-related behavior. Suppressing hub activity also impacted the topological architecture of the whole-brain network in network resilience, segregation and small worldness, but not network integration. This study has established a system that allows for mechanistically dissecting the relationship between local regions and brain network properties.

    "abstract": "Increases in temperature over recent decades have led to a significant reduction in the populations of tsetse flies (Glossina spp) in parts of the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. If this is true for other parts of Africa, populations of tsetse may actually be going extinct in some parts of the continent. Extinction probabilities for tsetse populations have not so far been estimated as a function of temperature. We develop a time-homogeneous branching process model for situations where tsetse flies live at different levels of fixed temperatures. We derive a probability distribution pk(T) for the number of female offspring an adult female tsetse is expected to produce in her lifetime, as a function of the fixed temperature at which she is living. We show that pk(T) can be expressed as a geometric series: its generating function is therefore a fractional linear type. We obtain expressions for the extinction probability, expected number of female offspring per female tsetse, and time to extinction. No tsetse population can escape extinction if subjected, for extended periods, to temperatures outside the range 16 {degrees}C - 32{degrees}C. Extinction probability increases more rapidly as temperatures approach and exceed the upper and lower limits. If the number of females is large enough, the population can still survive even at high temperatures (28{degrees}C - 31{degrees}C). Small decreases or increases in constant temperature in the neighbourhoods of 16{degrees}C and 31{degrees}C, respectively, can drive tsetse populations to extinction. Further study is needed to estimate extinction probabilities for tsetse populations in field situations where temperatures vary continuously.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTsetse flies (Glossina spp) are the vectors of the African sleeping sickness. We derived an expression for the extinction probability, and mean time to extinction, of closed populations of the flies experiencing different levels of fixed temperatures. Temperatures play a key role in tsetse population dynamics: no tsetse populations can escape extinction at constant temperatures < 16{degrees}C > 32{degrees}C. The effect of temperature is more severe if tsetse populations are already depleted. Increasingly high temperatures due to climate change may alter the distribution of tsetse populations in Africa. The continent may witness local extinctions of tsetse populations in some places, and appearances in places hitherto too cold for them.",

    "abstract": "Previous clinical studies with the FDA-approved alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, showed apparent efficacy to reverse the symptoms and disabilities of the neuropathic condition, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome; also, the anatomic spread and intensity of this syndrome has a proliferative character and it was proposed that phenoxybenzamine may have an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory mode of action. A previous study gave evidence that phenoxybenzamine had anti-proliferative activity in suppression of growth in several human tumor cell cultures. The same report demonstrated that the drug possessed significant histone deacetylase inhibitory activity. Utilizing the Harvard/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Broad Institute genomic database, CLUE, the present study suggests that the gene expression signature of phenoxybenzamine in malignant cell lines is consistent with anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory activity and suppression of tumor expansion by several possible mechanisms of action. Of particular note, phenoxybenzamine demonstrated signatures that were highly similar to those with glucocorticoid agonist activity. Also, gene expression signatures of phenoxbenzamine were consistent with several agents in each case that were known to suppress tumor proliferation, notably, protein kinase C inhibitors, Heat Shock Protein inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, and glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors. Searches in CLUE also confirmed the earlier observations of strong similarities between gene expression signatures of phenoxybenzamine and several histone deacetylase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, vascular enlargement is associated with endothelial cell proliferation, release of cytokines and adhesion molecule expression. Interleukin (IL)-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by T helper-17 cells that is critically involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. IL-36, IL-36{beta} and IL-36{gamma} are also inflammatory cytokines up-regulated in psoriasis and induced by various stimuli, including IL-17A. In this study, we found that human keratinocytes are the main source of IL-36, in particular of IL-36{gamma}. This cytokine was strongly induced by IL-17A and efficiently activated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs), which expressed both IL-17 and IL-36 receptors, by inducing a molecular signaling, such as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and NF-{kappa}B P65 subunit. We highlighted the intense IL-17A- and IL-36{gamma}-dependent interplay between keratinocytes and HDMECs, likely active in the psoriatic lesions and leading to the establishment of a cytokine network responsible for the development and maintenance of the inflamed state. On HDMECs, IL-17A or IL-36{gamma} showed a synergic activity with TNF-, potently inducing inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release and ICAM-1 expression. We also investigated the involvement of IL-36{gamma} and VEGF-A, substantially reduced in lesional skin of psoriatic patients pharmacologically treated with the anti-IL-17A antibody Secukinumab. Importantly, keratinocyte-derived IL-36{gamma} represented an additional pro-angiogenic mediator of IL-17A. We observed that keratinocyte-derived VEGF-A influenced proliferation but not reduced inflammatory responses of HDMECs. On the other hand, inhibition of IL-36{gamma} released by IL-17A-treated keratinocytes impaired ICAM-1 expression in HDMECs. Taken together, our data demonstrated that IL-17A and IL-36{gamma} are highly involved in endothelial cells/keratinocytes crosstalk in inflammatory skin conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic Exchange in Trypanosoma cruzi is controversial not only in relation to its frequency but also in relation to its mechanism. A mechanism of parasexuality has been proposed based on laboratory hybrids, but population genomics strongly suggests meiosis. In addition, mitochondrial introgression has been reported several times in natural isolates although its mechanism is not clear. Moreover, hybrid DTUs (TcV and TcVI) have inherited at least part of the kinetoplastic DNA (kDNA = mitochondrial DNA) from both parents.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal findingsIn order to address such topics, we sequenced and analyzed fourteen nuclear DNA fragments and three kDNA maxicircle genes in three TcI stocks which are natural clones potentially involved in events of genetic exchange. We also deep-sequenced (a total of 6,146,686 paired-end reads) the hypervariable region of kDNA minicircles (mHVR) in such three strains. In addition, we analyzed the DNA content by flow cytometry to address cell ploidy. We observed that most polymorphic sites in nuclear loci showed a hybrid pattern in one cloned strain and the other two cloned strains were compatible as parental strains (or nearly related to the true parents). The three clones have almost the same ploidy and the DNA content was similar to the reference strain Sylvio (an almost diploid strain). Despite maxicircle genes evolve faster than nuclear housekeeping ones, we did not detect polymorphism in the sequence of three maxicircle genes showing mito-nuclear discordance. In addition, the hybrid stock shared 66% of its mHVR clusters with one putative parental and 47% with the another one. In contrast, the putative parental stocks shared less than 30% of the mHVR clusters among them.\\n\\nConclusions/significanceThe results suggest a reductive division, a natural hybridization, biparental inheritance of the minicircles in the hybrid and maxicircle introgression. The models including such phenomena and that would explain the relationships between these three clones are discussed.\\n\\nAuthor summaryChagas disease, an important public health problem in Latin America, is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite it is a widely studied parasite, several questions about the biology of genetic exchange remain. Meiosis has not been yet observed in laboratory, although inferred from population genomic studies. In addition, previous results suggest that the mitochondrial DNA (called kDNA) may be inherited from both parents in hybrids. Here, we analyzed a hybrid strain and the potential parents to address about the mechanisms of genetic exchange at nuclear and mitochondrial level. We observed that the hybrid strain has heterozygous patterns and DNA content compatible with an event of meiosis. In addition, we observed that the evolutionary histories of nuclear DNA and maxicircles (a part of the kDNA) were discordant and the three strains share identical DNA sequences. Mitochondrial introgression of maxicircle DNA from one genotype to another may explain this observation. In addition, we detected that the hybrid strain shared minicircles (another part of the kDNA) with both parental strains. Our results suggest that hybridization implied meiosis and biparental inheritance of the kDNA. Further research is required to address such phenomena in detail.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial flagella are large extracellular protein organelles that drive bacteria motility and taxis in response to environmental changes. Previous research has focused mostly on describing the flagellar assembly, its rotation speed and power output. However, whether flagella are permanent cell structures and, if not, the circumstances and timing of their production and loss during the bacterial life cycle remain poorly understood. Here we used the single polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus as our model and, using in vivo fluorescence imaging, revealed that the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB) in a population varies substantially across different bacterial growth phases. In the early-exponential phase, the PFB increases rapidly in respect to incubation time, mostly through widespread flagella production. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaks at around 76% and the partitioning of flagella between the daughter cells is 1:1 and strictly at the old poles. After entering the stationary phase, the PFB starts to decline, mainly because daughter cells stop making new flagella after cell division. Interestingly, we discovered that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, though cell division has long been suspended. Lack of glucose was found to be a major factor promoting flagellar disassembly. We also revealed that the active loss of flagella was initiated by breakage in the rod connecting the extracellular filament to the basal body formed by MS- and C-rings. Our results highlight the dynamic production and loss of flagellar filaments during the bacterial life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a probabilistic, graphical framework for modeling high-dimensional joint distributions with complex dependence structures. BNs can be used to infer complex biological networks using heterogeneous data from different sources with missing values. Despite extensive studies in the past, network structure learning from data is still a challenging open question in BN research. In this study, we present a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based three-stage approach, GRowth-based Approach with Staged Pruning (GRASP). A double filtering strategy was first used for discovering the overall skeleton of the target BN. To search for the optimal network structures we designed an adaptive SMC (adSMC) algorithm to increase the diversity of sampled networks which were further improved by a new stage to reclaim edges missed in the skeleton discovery step. GRASP gave very satisfactory results when tested on benchmark networks. Finally, BN structure learning using multiple types of genomics data illustrates GRASPs potential in discovering novel biological relationships in integrative genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural process underlying the comprehension of visual images and sentences remains a major open challenge in cognitive neuroscience. We previously demonstrated with fMRI and DTI that comprehension of visual images and sentences describing human activities recruits a common semantic system. The current research tests the hypothesis that this common semantic system will display similar neural dynamics during processing in these two modalities. To investigate these neural dynamics we recorded EEG from naive subjects as they saw simple narratives made up of a first visual image depicting a human event, followed by a second that was either a sequentially coherent narrative follow-up, or not, of the first image. In separate blocks of trials the same protocol was presented using sentences. Analysis of the EEG signal revealed common neural dynamics for semantic processing across image and sentence modalities. Late positive ERPs were observed in response to sequential incoherence for sentences and images, consistent with previous studies that examined coherence in these two modalities separately. Analysis of oscillatory power revealed increased gamma-band activity for sequential coherence, again consistent with previous studies showing gamma increases for coherence and matching in sentence and image processing. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that training a classifier on data from one modality (images or sentences) allowed reliable decoding of the sequential coherence of data from trials in the untrained modality, providing further support for a common underlying semantic system for images and sentences. Processing sequential coherence of successive stimuli is associated with neural dynamics that are common to sentence and visual image modalities and that can be decoded across modalities. These results are discussed in the context of EEG signatures of narrative processing and meaning, and more general neural mechanisms for structure processing.",
