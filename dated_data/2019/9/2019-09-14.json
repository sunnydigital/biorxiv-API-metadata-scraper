    "abstract": "The goal of the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program is to identify robust and reproducible pro-longevity interventions that are efficacious across genetically diverse cohorts in the Caenorhabditis genus. The project design features multiple experimental replicates collected by three different laboratories. Our initial effort employed fully manual survival assays. With an interest in increasing throughput, we explored automation with flatbed scanner-based Automated Lifespan Machines (ALMs). We used ALMs to measure survivorship of 22 Caenorhabditis strains spanning three species. Additionally, we tested five chemicals that we previously found extended lifespan in manual assays. Overall, we found similar sources of variation among trials for the ALM and our previous manual assays, verifying reproducibility of outcome. Survival assessment was generally consistent between the manual and the ALM assays, although we did observe radically contrasting results for certain compound interventions. We found that particular lifespan outcome differences could be attributed to protocol elements such as enhanced light exposure of specific compounds in the ALM, underscoring that differences in technical details can influence outcomes and therefore interpretation. Overall, we demonstrate that the ALMs effectively reproduce a large, conventionally scored dataset from a diverse test set, independently validating ALMs as a robust and reproducible approach towards aging-intervention screening.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum receives signals directly from peripheral sensory systems and indirectly from the neocortex. To reveal how these different types of signals are processed in the cerebellar cortex, in vivo whole-cell recordings from granule cells and unit recordings from Purkinje cells were performed in mice in which primary somatosensory cortex (S1) could be optogenetically inhibited. Tactile stimulation of the upper lip produced two-phase granule cell responses (with latencies of [~] 8 ms and 28 ms), for which only the late phase was S1 dependent. Complex spikes and the late phase of simple spikes in Purkinje cells were also S1 dependent. These results indicate that individual granule cells integrate convergent inputs from the periphery and neocortex, and send their outputs to Purkinje cells, which then combine those signals with climbing fiber signals from the neocortex.",

    "abstract": "Circadian output genes act downstream of the clock to promote rhythmic changes in behavior and physiology, yet their molecular and cellular functions are not well understood. Here we characterize an interaction between regulators of circadian entrainment, output and synaptic development in Drosophila that influences clock-driven anticipatory increases in morning and evening activity. We previously showed the JETLAG (JET) E3 Ubiquitin ligase resets the clock upon light exposure, while the PDZ protein DYSCHRONIC (DYSC) regulates circadian locomotor output and synaptic development. Surprisingly, we find that JET and DYSC antagonistically regulate synaptic development at the larval neuromuscular junction, and reduced JET activity rescues arrhythmicity of dysc mutants. Consistent with our prior finding that DYSC regulates SLOWPOKE (SLO) potassium channel expression, jet mutations also rescue circadian and synaptic phenotypes in slo mutants. Collectively, our data suggest that JET, DYSC and SLO promote circadian output in part by regulating synaptic morphology.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LILoss of DYSC differentially impacts morning and evening oscillators\\nC_LIO_LIReduced JET activity rescues the dysc and slo arrhythmic phenotype\\nC_LIO_LIReduced JET activity causes synaptic defects at the larval NMJ\\nC_LIO_LIJET opposes DYSC and SLO function at the NMJ synapse\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While results from many past studies have implicated the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in mediating the expression of sustained negative affect, recent studies have highlighted a more complex role for BNST that includes aspects of fear learning in addition to defensive responding. As BNST is thought to encode ambiguous or unpredictable threat, it seems plausible that it may be involved in encoding early cued fear learning, especially immediately following a first tone-shock pairing when the CS-US contingency is not fully apparent. To investigate this, we conducted in vivo electrophysiological recording studies to examine neural dynamics of BNST units during cued fear acquisition and recall. We identified two functionally distinct subpopulations of BNST neurons that encode the intertrial interval (ITI) and seem to contribute to within- and across-session fear learning. \\\"Ramping\\\" cell activity during cued fear acquisition parallels the increase in freezing expression as mice learn the CS-US contingency, while \\\"Phasic\\\" cells encode post-shock (USpost) periods (30 s following encounter with footshock) only during early trials. Importantly, the magnitude of Phasic unit responsivity to the first USpost period predicted not only freezing expression in response to the subsequent CS during acquisition, but also CS freezing evoked 24 hr later during CS retrieval. These findings suggest for the first time that BNST activity may serve as an instructive signal during cued fear learning.",

Here, we show that PV activity within the nucleus accumbens shell (sNAc) is required for producing anxiety-related avoidance when mice are under anxiogenic situations; sNAcPV neurons exhibited high excitability in chronically stressed mice model, which generated excessive maladaptive avoidance behavior in an anxiogenic context. We also discovered a novel GABAergic projections from the anterior dorsal bed nuclei of stria terminalis (adBNST) to sNAcPV neurons; optogenetic activation of these afferent terminals in sNAc produced an anxiolytic effect via GABA transmission. Next, we further demonstrated that chronic stressors attenuated the inhibitory synaptic transmission at adBNSTGABA [Formula] sNAcPV synapses, which in turn explains the hyperexcitability of sNAcPV neurons on stressed models; therefore, activation of these GABAergic afferents in sNAc rescued the excessive avoidance behavior related to anxious state.\\n\\nOur findings reveal the coordination between BNST and NAc through an inhibitory architecture in controlling of anxiety-related response and provide a neurobiological basis for therapeutic interventions in pathological anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for building tissues usually start with a non-biological blueprint, or rely on self-organization, which does not extend to organ-scales. This has limited the construction of large tissues that simultaneously encode fine-scale cell organization. Here we bridge scales by mimicking developmental dynamics using \\\"kinomorphs\\\", tissue scaffolds that undergo globally programmed shape and density changes to trigger local self-organization of cells in many locations at once. In this first report, we focus on mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM) compaction and division into leaflets that occurs in kidney collecting duct development. We start by creating single-cell resolution cell patterns in ECM-mimetic hydrogels that are >10x larger than previously described, by leveraging photo-lithographic technology. These patterns are designed to mimic the branch geometry of the embryonic kidney collecting duct tree. We then predict the shape dynamics of kinomorphs driven by cell contractility-based compaction of the ECM using kinematic origami simulations. We show that these dynamics spur centimeter-scale assembly of structurally mature ~50 m-diameter epithelial tubules that are locally self-organized, but globally programmed. Our approach prescribes tubule network geometry at ~5x smaller length-scales than currently possible using 3D printing, and at local cell densities comparable to in vivo tissues. Kinomorphs could be used to scaffold and \\\"plumb\\\" arrays of organoids in the future, by guiding the morphogenesis of epithelial networks. Such hybrid globally programmed/locally self-organized tissues address a major gap in our ability to recapitulate organ-scale tissue structure.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEngineers are attempting to build tissues that mimic human diseases outside of the body. Although stem cells can be coaxed to form small organoids with a diversity of cell types, they do not properly organize over large distances by themselves. We report a strategy to mimic developmental processes using dynamic materials that attempt to guide a cellular \\\"blueprint\\\" towards a more complex tissue endpoint. We call these materials kinomorphs, combining the Greek kino (propel, drive) and morfi (form, shape), since they seek to shepherd both the shape and developmental trajectory of cell collectives within them. Kinomorphs could pave the way towards organ-scale synthetic tissues built through a hybrid of engineering and self-organization strategies.",

    "abstract": "Watersheds are important for supplying fresh water, the quality of which depends on complex interplay involving physical, chemical and biological processes. As water percolates through the soil and underlying weathering rock en route to the river corridor, microorganisms mediate key geochemical transformations, yet the distribution and functional capacities of subsurface microbial communities remain little understood. We have studied metabolic capacities of microbial communities along a meadow to floodplain hillslope transect within the East-River watershed, Colorado, using genome resolved metagenomics and carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes. Very limited strain/species overlap was found at different depths below the ground surface and at different distances along the hillslope, possibly due to restricted hydraulic connectivity after early stages of snowmelt. Functions such as carbon fixation and selenate reduction were prevalent at multiple sites, although the lineages of organisms responsible tend to be location-specific. Based on its abundance, sulfur is significantly more important for microbial metabolism at the floodplain compared to on the hillslope. Nitrification and methylamine oxidation are likely only occurring within the floodplain, with nitrification capacity in shallow soil, and methylamine oxidation in deeper unsaturated sediment. Biogenic methane was detected in deep surface samples, but methanogenic organisms were not identified.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementIn a previous study within a hillslope to riparian zone transect of a sub-alpine watershed, the community structure was explored using ribosomal protein S3 genes, and the metabolic potential was hypothesized based on the presence of metabolism related genes. However, tying specific strains and species to metabolic functioning was not discussed as resolved genomes were not available.\n\nIn the current study, we use genome-resolved metagenomics along with carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes to explore the spatial distribution of biogeochemical processes. By linking taxonomy and function, using multiple functional genes indicative of full metabolic pathways, we detect heterogeneity in the distribution of metabolic potential and the organisms involved with depth and landscape position. Thus, we infer how microbiome genomic variation impacts biogeochemical cycling across the watershed.\n\nWe found very limited strain/species overlap at different depths below the surface and along the hillslope, possibly due to the restricted site to site hydraulic connectivity, and show that communities are largely distinct in their metabolic capacities. Both proximity to the river and the underlying Mancos shale apparently control species distribution and metabolic potential.\n\nFunctions such as carbon fixation and selenate reduction were prevalent at multiple sites, although the lineages of organisms responsible tend to be location-specific. Arsenate detoxification was found to be prevalent in the riparian zone whereas selenate reduction was detected within weathered Mancos shale. We conclude that important ecosystem functions are strongly associated with the riparian zone, some of which may have crucial implications as to water quality and human health.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCommunity assembly processes, environmental filtering and limiting similarity, determine functional traits values within communities. Because environment influences the number of viable functional strategies species might take, a strong effect of environmental filter often results in communities having species with similar trait values and narrow functional niches. On the other hand, limiting similarity lead to communities with broader functional spaces. The degree to community assembly processes influence wood trait variation has important implications for paleoclimate estimation using fossil wood since the main tenet of the approach is environmental driven trait convergence, and assumes a central role of environmental filtering. We used functional diversity (FD) to determine how three wood anatomical traits vary in 14 extant communities (272 species) growing under different climate regimes, and inferred the prevalence of environmental filtering/limiting similarity. We also calculated FD metrics for the El Cien Formation fossil woods and discussed the results in light of the current knowledge of the flora. We found lower anatomical diversity in communities growing in dry/cool places (smaller functional spaces and lower abundance of trait combinations), suggesting that strong wood anatomical trait convergence could be the result of stronger habitat filtering in these communities. A lower strength of environmental filter in warm/wet environments, likely results in an amplification of the role of other drivers that promote higher number of hydraulic strategies through niche partition in highly structured communities. More complex ecological structures in mild tropical places likely lead to a higher spread of wood trait values. This asymmetry in the strength of environmental filter along climate gradients, suggest that the imbalances in strength of the trait-climate convergence, should be incorporated in paleoclimate prediction models. FD approach can be used to recognize promising traits with narrow niches along climate gradients, and therefore a constant effect of environmental filter.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Airway mucus is essential for healthy lung defense1, but excessive mucus in asthma obstructs airflow, leading to severe and potentially fatal outcomes2-5. Current asthma therapies reduce allergic inflammation and relax airway smooth muscle, but treatments are often inadequate due to their minimal effects on mucus obstruction6,7. The lack of efficacious mucus-targeted treatments stems from a poor understanding of healthy mucus function and pathological mucus dysfunction at a molecular level. The chief macromolecules in mucus, polymeric mucins, are massive glycoproteins whose sizes and biophysical properties are dictated in part by covalent disulfide bonds that link mucin molecules into assemblies of 10 or more subunits8. Once secreted, mucin glycopolymers can aggregate to form plugs that block airflow. Here we show that reducing mucin disulfide bonds depolymerizes mucus in human asthma and reverses pathological effects of mucus hypersecretion in a mouse allergic asthma model. In mice challenged with a fungal allergen, inhaled mucolytic treatment acutely loosened mucus mesh, enhanced mucociliary clearance (MCC), and abolished airway hyperreactivity (AHR) to the bronchoprovocative agent methacholine. AHR reversal was directly related to reduced mucus plugging. Furthermore, protection in mucolytic treated mice was identical to prevention observed in mice lacking Muc5ac, the polymeric mucin required for allergic AHR in murine models9. These findings establish grounds for developing novel fast-acting agents to treat mucus hypersecretion in asthma10,11. Efficacious mucolytic therapies could be used to directly improve airflow, help resolve inflammation, and enhance the effects of inhaled treatments for asthma and other respiratory conditions11,12.",
