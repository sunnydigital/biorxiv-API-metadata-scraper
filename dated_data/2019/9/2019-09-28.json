    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for evaluating community diversity and evolutionary history. In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Irokis utility for exploring biological and ecological trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of metadata. The Iroki web application and documentation are available at https://www.iroki.net or through the VIROME portal (http://virome.dbi.udel.edu).

    "abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) plays a crucial role in learning, memory and spatial navigation. Only a small fraction of mature dentate granule cells (mDGCs) is active during behavior, while the large majority remains silent. To date, the properties of this active subset of neurons remain poorly investigated. Using fosGFP transgenic mice, we show ex vivo that activated mDGCs, from mice maintained in their home cage, exhibit a marked lower intrinsic excitability compared to the non-activated cells. Remarkably, activated mDGCs, from mice trained in a virtual environment, are more excitable than those from mice maintained in their home cage. Therefore, we show that activated mDGCs display different intrinsic properties and excitable states depending on the context of their activation. We propose that these properties could constitute a neural signature of cell assemblies recruited in different behavioral contexts.",

We investigate this question by letting participants play a communication game, where one player describes a pattern, and another player redraws it based on the description alone. We use this paradigm to compare two models of pattern description, one compositional (complex structures built out of simpler ones) and one non-compositional. We find that compositional patterns are communicated more effectively than non-compositional patterns, that a compositional model of pattern description predicts which patterns are harder to describe, and that this model can be used to evaluate participants drawings, producing human-like quality ratings. Our results suggest that natural language can tap into a compositionally structured pattern description language.",

    "abstract": "Over 1250 mutations in SCN1A, the Nav1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel gene, are associated with seizure disorders including GEFS+. To evaluate how a specific mutation, independent of genetic background, causes seizure activity we generated two pairs of isogenic human iPSC lines by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. One pair is a control line from an unaffected sibling, and the mutated control carrying the GEFS+ K1270T SCN1A mutation. The second pair is a GEFS+ patient line with the K1270T mutation, and the corrected patient line. By comparing the electrophysiological properties in inhibitory and excitatory iPSC-derived neurons from these pairs, we found the K1270T mutation causes cell type-specific alterations in sodium current density and evoked firing, resulting in hyperactive neural networks. We also identified differences associated with genetic background and interaction between the mutation and genetic background. Comparisons within and between dual pairs of isogenic iPSC-derived neuronal cultures provide a novel platform for evaluating cellular mechanisms underlying a disease phenotype and for developing patient-specific anti-seizure therapies.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with often a chronic course. Neuroimaging studies report brain abnormalities in both white and gray matter structures. However, the relationship between microstructural white matter differences and volumetric subcortical structures is not known.\\n\\nWe investigated 30 long-term treated patients with schizophrenia (mean age 51.1{+/-}7.9 years, illness duration 27.6{+/-}8.0 years) and 42 healthy controls (mean age 54.1{+/-}9.1 years) using 3 T diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging. The free-water imaging method was used to model the diffusion signal, and subcortical volumes were obtained from FreeSurfer. We applied multiple linear regression to investigate associations between (i) patient status and regional white matter microstructure, (ii) medication dose or clinical symptoms on white matter microstructure in patients, and (iii) for interactions between subcortical volumes and diagnosis for microstructural white matter regions showing significant patient-control differences.\\n\\nThe patients had significantly decreased free-water corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt), explained by decreased axial diffusivity and increased radial diffusivity (RDt) bilaterally in the anterior corona radiata (ACR) and the left anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) compared to controls. In the fornix, the patients had significantly increased RDt. In patients, positive symptoms were associated with localized increased free-water and negative symptoms with localized decreased FAt and increased RDt. There were significant interactions between patient status and several subcortical structures on white matter microstructure and the free-water compartment for left ACR and fornix, and limited to the free-water compartment for right ACR and left ALIC. The Cohens d effect sizes were medium to large (0.61 to 1.20, absolute values).\\n\\nThe results suggest a specific pattern of frontal white matter axonal degeneration and demyelination and fornix demyelination that is attenuated in the presence of larger structures of the limbic system in patients with chronic schizophrenia.

    "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) belong to a large group of organic pollutant which considers as a potential health hazard to living beings. Herein, naphthalene biodegradation potential by free and immobilized Pseudomonas putida strain KD10 and Pseudomonas sp. consortium were studied. Additionally, naphthalene 1, 2-dioxygenase (nahAc) was sequenced and analyzed, which reveals two altered amino acid residues. However, the altered amino acid residues are not present in the vicinity of the active site. The gas-phase binding free energy ({Delta}GLondon) of the mutant variant of naphthalene 1, 2-dioxygenase was -7.10 kcal mol-1 which closely resembles the wild type variant. Naphthalene biodegradation rate by Pseudomonas putida strain KD10 was 79.12 mg L-1 day-1 and it was significantly elevated up to 123 mg L-1 day-1 by the immobilized Pseudomonas sp. consortium. The half-life (t1/2) for naphthalene biodegradation was 3.1 days with the inhibition constant (ki), substrate saturation constant (ks) and maximum specific degradation rate constant (qmax) of 1268 mg L-1, 395.5 mg L-1 and 0.65 h-1, respectively, for the Pseudomonas putida strain KD10. However, the t1/2 value was significantly reduced to 2 days along with ki, ks and qmaxvalues of 1475 mg L-1, 298.8 mg L-1 and 0.71 h-1, respectively, by the immobilized Pseudomonas sp. consortium. The GC-MS data suggest that KD10 might follow D-gluconic acid mediated meta-cleavage pathway of catechol biodegradation. It is concluded that naphthalene biodegradation performance by immobilized Pseudomonas sp. consortium was superior to free or immobilized Pseudomonas putida KD10.

    "abstract": "The study of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using natural variation in inbred populations has yielded detailed information about the transcriptional regulation of complex traits. Studies on eQTL using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) led to insights on local and distant regulatory loci of transcript abundance. However, determining the underlying causal polymorphic genes or variants is difficult, but ultimately essential for the understanding of regulatory networks of complex traits. This requires insight into whether associated loci are single eQTL or a combination of closely linked eQTL, and how this QTL micro-architecture depends on the environment. We addressed these questions by mapping eQTL in N2 x CB4856 C. elegans RIL populations across three different environments (control, heat-stress, and recovery). To test for independent replication of the RIL eQTL, we used introgression lines (ILs). Both populations indicate that the overall heritability, number, and position of eQTL differed among environments. Across environments we were able to replicate 70% of the local- and 40% of the distant-eQTL using the ILs. Simulation models revealed that additive effects explain up to 60-93% of RIL/IL heritability across environments. Closely linked eQTL explained up to 40% of RIL/IL heritability in the control environment whereas only 7% in the heat-stress and recovery environments. In conclusion, we show that reproducibility of eQTL was higher for local vs. distant eQTL and that the environment affects the eQTL micro-architecture.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the correlation structure associated with multiple brain measurements informs about potential \\\"functional groupings\\\" and network organization. The correlation structure can be conveniently captured in a matrix format that summarizes the relationships among a set of brain measurements involving two regions, for example. Such functional connectivity matrix is an important component of many types of investigation focusing on network-level properties of the brain, including clustering brain states, characterizing dynamic functional states, performing participant identification (so-called \\\"fingerprinting\\\") understanding how tasks reconfigure brain networks, and inter-subject correlation analysis. In these investigations, some notion of proximity or similarity of functional connectivity matrices is employed, such as their Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation (by correlating the matrix entries). Here, we propose the use of a geodesic distance metric that reflects the underlying non-Euclidean geometry of functional correlation matrices. The approach is evaluated in the context of participant identification (fingerprinting): given a participants functional connectivity matrix based on resting-state or task data, how effectively can the participant be identified? Using geodesic distance, identification accuracy was over 95% on resting-state data, and exceeded the Pearson correlation approach by 20%. For whole-cortex regions, accuracy improved on a range of tasks by between 2% and as much as 20%. We also investigated identification using pairs of subnetworks (say, dorsal attention plus default mode), and particular combinations improved accuracy over whole-cortex participant identification by over 10%. The geodesic distance also outperformed Pearson correlation when the former employed a fourth of the data as the latter. Finally, we suggest that low-dimensional distance visualizations based on the geodesic approach help uncover the geometry of task functional connectivity in relation to that during resting-state. We propose that the use of the geodesic distance is an effective way to compare the correlation structure of the brain across a broad range of studies.",

    "abstract": "As developmental biologists in the age of genome editing, we now have access to an ever-increasing array of tools to manipulate endogenous gene expression. The auxin-inducible degradation system, allows for spatial and temporal control of protein degradation, functioning through the activity of a hormone-inducible Arabidopsis F-box protein, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1). In the presence of auxin, TIR1 serves as a substrate recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF), ubiquitinating auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation. Here, we optimize the Caenorhabditis elegans AID method, utilizing 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), an indole-free synthetic analog of the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We take advantage of the photostability of NAA to demonstrate via quantitative high-resolution microscopy that rapid degradation of target proteins can be detected in single cells within 30 minutes of exposure. Additionally, we show that NAA works robustly in both standard growth media and physiological buffer. We also demonstrate that K-NAA, the water-soluble, potassium salt of NAA, can be combined with microfluidics for targeted protein degradation in C. elegans larvae. We provide insight into how the AID system functions in C. elegans by determining that TIR1 interacts with C. elegans SKR-1/2, CUL-1, and RBX-1 to degrade target proteins. Finally, we present highly penetrant defects from NAA-mediated degradation of the Ftz-F1 nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-25, during C. elegans uterine-vulval development. Together, this work provides a conceptual improvement to the AID system for dissecting gene function at the single-cell level during C. elegans development.",

These guidelines have helped ensure that the emerging draft of the complete human proteome is highly accurate and with low numbers of false-positive protein identifications. Here, we describe an update to these guidelines based on consensus-reaching discussions with the wider HPP community over the past year. The revised 3.0 guidelines address several major and minor identified gaps. We have added guidelines for emerging data independent acquisition (DIA) MS workflows and for use of the new Universal Spectrum Identifier (USI) system being developed by the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI). In addition, we discuss updates to the standard HPP pipeline for collecting MS evidence for all proteins in the HPP, including refinements to minimum evidence. We present a new plan for incorporating MassIVE-KB into the HPP pipeline for the next (HPP 2020) cycle in order to obtain more comprehensive coverage of public MS data sets. The main checklist has been reorganized under headings and subitems and related guidelines have been grouped. In sum, Version 2.1 of the HPP MS Data Interpretation Guidelines has served well and this timely update to version 3.0 will aid the HPP as it approaches its goal of collecting and curating MS evidence of translation and expression for all predicted [~]20,000 human proteins encoded by the human genome.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/733576v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (18K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8765f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136235aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14aef76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af33d2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Synaptic strength depends on the number of cell-surface neurotransmitter receptors in dynamic equilibrium with intracellular pools. Dysregulation of this homeostatic balance occurs e.g. in myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease characterized by a decrease in the number of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Monoclonal antibody mAb35 mimics this effect. Here we use STORM nanoscopy to characterize the individual and ensemble dynamics of mAb35-crosslinked receptors in the clonal cell line CHO-K1/A5, which robustly expresses adult muscle-type nAChRs. Antibody labeling of live cells results in 80% receptor immobilization. The remaining mobile fraction exhibits a heterogeneous combination of Brownian and anomalous diffusion. Single-molecule trajectories exhibit a two-state switching behavior between free Brownian walks and anticorrelated walks within confinement areas. The latter act as permeable fences ([~]34 nm radius, [~]400 ms lifetime). Dynamic clustering, trapping and immobilization also occur in larger nanocluster zones (120-180 nm radius) with longer lifetimes (11 {+/-} 1 s), in a strongly cholesterol-sensitive manner. Cholesterol depletion increases the size and average duration of the clustering phenomenon; cholesterol enrichment has the opposite effect. The disclosed high proportion of mAb35-crosslinked immobile receptors, together with their anomalous, cholesterol-sensitive diffusion and clustering, provides new insights into the antibody-enhanced antigenic modulation that leads to physiopathological internalization and degradation of receptors in myasthenia.\\n\\nA preliminary version of this work has appeared in the biorXiv repository: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/744664v1.

We find that kNN-based methods perform remarkably well while yielding stable results almost over the entire range of k. We provide a GitHub repository (pievos101/kNN-Genome-Scans) containing R source code to demonstrate how to apply the proposed methods to real-world genomic data using the population genomics R-package PopGenome.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is extremely complex for both causal mechanism and clinical manifestation, requiring efforts to uncover its diversity and the corresponding mechanisms. Here, we applied a modelling analysis to investigate the regulation divergence among a large-scale cohort of AD patients. We found that transcription regulation tended to get degenerated in AD patients, which contributed to disease development and the detrimental clinical outcomes, mainly by disrupting protein degradation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic functions. To measure the accumulated effects, we came up with a new concept, regulation loss burden, which better correlated with AD related clinical manifestations and the ageing process. The epigenetic studies to multiple active regulation marks also supported a tendency of regulation loss in AD patients. Our finding can lead to a unified model as AD causal mechanism, where AD and its diversity are contributed by accumulated degeneration of transcriptional regulation.\\n\\nThe significance of this study is that: (1) it is the first system biology investigation to transcription regulation divergence among AD patients; (2) we observed an accumulated degeneration of transcription regulation, which well correlates with detrimental clinical outcomes; (3) transcriptional degeneration also contributes to the ageing process, where its correlation with ages is up to 0.78.",

    "abstract": "Animals use behavioural cues from others to make decisions in a variety of contexts. There is growing evidence, from a range of taxa, that information about the locations of food patches can spread through a population via social connections. However, it is not known whether information about the quality of potential food sources transmits similarly. We studied foraging behaviour in a population of wild songbirds with known social associations, and tested whether flock members use social information about the profitability of patches to inform their foraging decisions. We provided artificial patches (ephemeral bird feeders) that appeared identical but were either profitable (contained food) or unprofitable (contained no food). If information about patch profitability spreads via social associations, we predicted that empty feeders would only be sampled by individuals that are less connected to each other than expected by chance. In contrast, we found that individuals recorded at empty feeders were more closely associated with each other than predicted by a null model simulating random arrival of individuals, mirroring pattern of increased connectedness among individuals recorded at full feeders. We then simulated arrival under network-based diffusion of information, and demonstrate that the observed pattern at both full and empty feeders matches predictions derived from this post-hoc model. Our results suggest that foraging songbirds only use social cues about the location of potential food sources, but not their profitability. These findings agree with the hypothesis that individuals balance the relative economic costs of using different information, where the costs of personally sampling a patch upon arrival is low relative to the cost of searching for patches. This study extends previous work on information spread through avian social networks, by suggesting important links between how animals use information at different stages of the acquisition process and the emerging population-level patterns of patch use.",

    "abstract": "During pregnancy, maternal metabolic diseases and hormonal imbalance may alter fetal beta cell development and/or proliferation, thus leading to an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Although thyroid hormones play an important role in fetal endocrine pancreas development, the impact of maternal hypothyroidism on glucose homeostasis in adult offsprings remains poorly understood. Here, we show that when fed normal chow, adult mice born to hypothyroid mothers were more glucose-tolerant due to beta cell hyperproliferation and increased insulin sensitivity. However, following high fat feeding, these offsprings became profoundly hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant compared to controls from euthyroid mothers. Suggesting presence of epigenetic changes, altered glucose metabolism was maintained in a second generation of animals. As such, gestational hypothyroidism induces long-term and persistent alterations in endocrine pancreas function, which may have important implications for type 2 diabetes prevention in affected individuals.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEDiabetes and hypothyroidism are two major public health issues, affecting [~] 9 and 2 % of the population worldwide, respectively. As master metabolic gatekeepers, the thyroid hormones play an essential role in metabolism and fetal development. However, gestation increases demand on the thyroid axis in the mother, leading to hypothyroidism in 0.5 % of pregnancies. Maternal hypothyroidism is associated with deficits in fetal growth that may lead to long-term alterations in metabolism in the offspring. We therefore sought to investigate the effects of gestational hypothyroidism on glucose metabolism in adult offspring and their descendants, and how this may predispose to diabetes development.",

The model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lends itself to automated fluid-flow based sorting because of its ability to live in aqueous solutions. Here, we build upon previous developments to construct a microfluidic device capable of sorting individuals based on a variety of characteristics, with a specific application toward differentiating fluorescently marked individuals. We find that our new design generates highly repeatable pools of sorted individuals. In general, there tends to be a tradeoff between precision and speed that can be optimized based on several different factors. Importantly, sorting does not decrease offspring production, and individuals can be sorted multiple times for increased precision. We provide detailed parts lists, schematics and software to allow implementation of these methods in other laboratories. Our results demonstrate that custom-made sorter chips can be a flexible and versatile addition to the nematode experimental toolbox.",

In the present study, we sought to characterize Nurr1 as a causative factor in LID expression.\\n\\nMethodsWe used rAAV2/5 to overexpress Nurr1 or GFP in the parkinsonian striatum of LID-resistant Lewis or LID-prone Fischer-344 (F344) rats. In a second cohort, rats received the Nurr1 agonist amodiaquine (AQ) together with L-DOPA or ropinirole. All rats received a chronic DA agonist and were evaluated for LID severity. Finally, we performed single unit recordings and dendritic spine analyses in drug-naive rAAV-injected parkinsonian rats.\\n\\nResultsrAAV-GFP injected LID-resistant Lewis rats displayed mild LID and no induction of striatal Nurr1. However, Lewis rats transduced to overexpress Nurr1 developed severe LID. Nurr11 agonism with AQ exacerbated LID in F344 rats. We additionally determined that in L-DOPA-naive rats striatal rAAV-Nurr1 overexpression 1) increased firing activity in dopamine-depleted striatal direct pathway neurons, and 2) decreased spine density and thin-spine morphology on striatal medium spiny neurons, mimicking changes seen in dyskinetic rats. Finally, we provide post-mortem evidence of Nurr1 expression in the striatum of L-DOPA treated PD patients.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data demonstrate that ectopic induction of striatal Nurr1 is capable of inducing LID behavior and associated neuropathology, even in resistant subjects. These data support a direct role of Nurr1 in aberrant neuronal plasticity and LID induction, providing a potential novel target for therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "RationaleMany patients respond inadequately to antidepressant drug treatment; the search for alternate pharmacological treatment mechanisms is ongoing. Until the 1950s, opium was sometimes used to treat depression, but eventually abandoned due to addiction risk. Recent insights into opioid biology have sparked a renewed interest in the potential antidepressant properties of opioids.\\n\\nObjectiveWe studied how mu (MOR), kappa (KOR) and delta (DOR) opioid receptor ligands affect the dysregulation of motivated behavior (progressive ratio responding; PR), stress-coping behavior (forced swim test; FST) and hippocampal neurogenesis in rats, all induced by the back-translational interferon-alpha (IFN-)-induced depression model.\\n\\nMethodsMale Wistar rats (3-months old, 8/group) were treated with recombinant human IFN- (170,000 IU/kg, 3 times/week) or saline. Ligands of the MOR, KOR and DOR receptors were administered as follows: a single subcutaneous dose, 30min before PR and 1h before FST, of the MOR agonist morphine (full agonist; 5mg/kg), the partial agonist RDC 2944 (0.1mg/kg) and the antagonist, cyprodime (10mg/kg); of the KOR agonist, U50 488 (5mg/kg), the antagonist, DIPPA (10mg/kg); and the DOR agonist, SNC 80 (20mg/kg) and antagonist naltrindole (10mg/kg). After 4 days of treatment with the mitotic BrdU marker, hippocampi were harvested and analysed for neurogenesis. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, orally) served as control for assay sensitivity in the FST.\\n\\nResultsThe KOR antagonist, DIPPA, the DOR agonist SNC 80 and fluoxetine reversed the IFN--induced immobility increase in the FST. The MOR agonist, morphine, the KOR antagonist DIPPA, and the KOR agonist U50 488 reduced the IFN--induced increase in the breakpoint in the PR. The DOR agonist SNC 80 recovered the IFN--induced decrease in BrdU+ hippocampal cells.\\n\\nConclusionOpioid receptors mediate different aspects of the IFN--induced dysregulation of motivational and stress-coping behaviors and hippocampal neurogenesis in a back-translational model of depression. KORs and DORs appear to play more prominent roles in torpor-inertia-type behaviors, whereas DORs appear more involved in the regulation of neurogenesis.",

We hypothesized that admixture can enable rapid adaptive evolution in human populations by introducing novel genetic variants (haplotypes) at intermediate frequencies, and we tested this hypothesis via the analysis of whole genome sequences sampled from admixed Latin American populations in Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nResultsOur screen for admixture-enabled selection relies on the identification of loci that contain more or less ancestry from a given source population than would be expected given the genome-wide ancestry frequencies. We employed a combined evidence approach to evaluate levels of ancestry enrichment at (1) single loci across multiple populations and (2) multiple loci that function together to encode polygenic traits. We found cross-population signals of African ancestry enrichment at the major histocompatibility locus on chromosome 6, consistent with admixture-enabled selection for enhanced adaptive immune response. Several of the human leukocyte antigen genes at this locus (HLA-A, HLA-DRB51 and HLA-DRB5) showed independent evidence of positive selection prior to admixture, based on extended haplotype homozygosity in African populations. A number of traits related to inflammation, blood metabolites, and both the innate and adaptive immune system showed evidence of admixture-enabled polygenic selection in Latin American populations.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results reported here, considered together with the ubiquity of admixture in human evolution, suggest that admixture serves as a fundamental mechanism that drives rapid adaptive evolution in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is severely understudied, especially in invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusc pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis). With PCR, 3 and 5 RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis nervous system named Lst Inx1-8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluscan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and a functionally defined network for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigation of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.\\n\\nSummary StatementBy characterizing the gap junction gene innexin in Lymnaea stagnalis, we open opportunities for novel studies on the regulation, plasticity, and evolutionary function of electrical synapses throughout the animal kingdom.",

During domestication, azuki bean (Vigna angularis) and yard-long bean (Vigna unguiculata cv-gr. Sesquipedalis) have reduced or lost the sclerenchyma and lost the shattering behavior of seed pods. Here we performed fine-mapping with back-crossed populations and narrowed the candidate genomic region down to 4 kbp in azuki bean and 13 kbp in yard-long bean. Among genes located in these regions, we found MYB26 genes encoded truncated proteins in both the domesticated species. We also found in azuki bean and other legumes that MYB26 is duplicated and only the duplicated copy is expressed in seed pods. Interestingly, in Arabidopsis MYB26 is single copy and is specifically expressed in anther to initiate secondary wall thickening that is required for anther dehiscence. These facts indicated that, in legumes, MYB26 has been duplicated and acquired a new role in development of pod sclerenchyma.

    "abstract": "Hop (Humulus lupulus L. var Lupulus) is a diploid, dioecious plant with a history of cultivation spanning more than one thousand years. Hop cones are valued for their use in brewing, and around the world, hop has been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments. Efforts to determine how biochemical pathways responsible for desirable traits are regulated have been challenged by the large, repetitive, and heterozygous genome of hop. We present the first report of a haplotype-phased assembly of a large plant genome. Our assembly and annotation of the Cascade cultivar genome is the most extensive to date. PacBio long-read sequences from hop were assembled with FALCON and phased with FALCON-Unzip. Using the diploid assembly to assess haplotype variation, we discovered genes under positive selection enriched for stress-response, growth, and flowering functions. Comparative analysis of haplotypes provides insight into large-scale structural variation and the selective pressures that have driven hop evolution. Previous studies estimated repeat content at around 60%. With improved resolution of long terminal retrotransposons (LTRs) due to long-read sequencing, we found that hop is nearly 78% repetitive. Our quantification of repeat content provides context for the size of the hop genome, and supports the hypothesis of whole genome duplication (WGD), rather than expansion due to LTRs. With our more complete assembly, we have identified a homolog of cannabidiolic acid synthase (CBDAS) that is expressed in multiple tissues. The approaches we developed to analyze a phased, diploid assembly serve to deepen our understanding of the genomic landscape of hop and may have broader applicability to the study of other large, complex genomes.",

Here we sequenced and analyzed DNA and RNA from two locations from 30 full-term pregnancies. Implementing an allele specific approach to examine XCI, we report evidence that XCI in the human placenta is patchy, with large patches of either silenced maternal or paternal X chromosomes. Further, using similar measurements, we show that this is in contrast to adult tissues, which generally exhibit mosaic X-inactivation, where bulk samples exhibit both maternal and paternal X chromosome expression. Further, by comparing skewed samples in placenta and adult tissues, we identify genes that are uniquely silenced or expressed in the placenta compared to adult tissues highlighting the need for tissue-specific maps of XCI.",

    "abstract": "Identifying regulatory genetic effects in pluripotent cells provides important insights into disease variants with potentially transient or developmental origins. Combining existing and newly-generated data, we characterized 1,367 iPSC lines from 948 unique donors, collectively analyzed within the \\\"Integrated iPSC QTL\\\" (i2QTL) Consortium. The sample size of our study allowed us to derive the most comprehensive map of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in pluripotent human cells to date. We mapped the effects of nearby common genetic variants on five expression phenotypes, identifying cis-QTL at gene-, exon-level and transcript-, splicing-, alternative polyadenylation-ratio (APA) for a total of 18,556 genes. For gene-level, we further quantified the effects of rare and singleton variants, and the effect of distal variants that act in trans (trans-eQTL), which we replicated in independent samples. Our data are a valuable community resource, uncovering novel regulatory effects that have not previously been described in differentiated cells and tissues. Building on this regulatory map, we functionally explore GWAS signals for over 4,336 trait loci, finding evidence for colocalization with common and rare iPSC QTL for traits such as height and BMI, and diseases, such as cancer and coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome is a type of severe childhood epilepsy that responds poorly to current anti-epileptic drugs. In recent years, zebrafish disease models with Scn1Lab sodium channel deficiency have been generated to seek novel anti-epileptic drug candidates, some of which are currently undergoing clinical trials. However, the spectrum of neuronal deficits observed following Scn1Lab depletion in zebrafish larvae has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap and gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuron hyperexcitation in Scn1Lab-depleted larvae, we analyzed neuron activity in vivo using combined local field potential recording and transient calcium uptake imaging, studied the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and neurons as well as investigated neuron apoptosis. We found that Scn1Lab-depleted larvae displayed recurrent epileptiform seizure events, associating massive synchronous calcium uptakes and ictal-like local field potential bursts. Scn1Lab-depletion also caused a dramatic shift in the neuronal and synaptic balance toward excitation and increased neuronal death. Our results thus provide in vivo evidence suggesting that Scn1Lab loss of function causes neuron hyperexcitation as the result of disturbed synaptic balance and increased neuronal apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Galdieria maxima is a polyextremophilic alga capable of diverse metabolic processes. Ammonia is widely used in culture media typical of laboratory growth. Recent reports that this species can grow on wastes promote the concept that G. maxima might have biotechnological utility. Accordingly, there is a need to know the range of pH levels that can support G. maxima growth in a given nitrogen source. Here, we examined the combined effect of pH and nitrate/ammonium source on the growth and long-term response of the photochemical process to a pH gradient in different G. maxima strains. All were able to use differing nitrogen sources, despite both the growth rate and photochemical activity were significantly affected by the combination with the pH. All strains acidified the NH4+-medium (pH<3); only G. maxima IPPAS P507 showed reduced capacity in lowering the pH from 6.5. pH was a limiting factor in nitrate uptake at pH[&ge;]6.5; noteworthy, at pH 5 on nitrate G. maxima ACUF551 showed a good growth performance, despite the alkalization of the medium.",

    "abstract": "Host genetics plays an important role in determining the outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. We previously found that Collaborative Cross mouse strains differ in their susceptibility to Mtb, and that the CC042/GeniUnc (CC042) strain suffered from a rapidly progressive disease and failed to produce the protective cytokine, IFN{gamma}, in the lung. Here, we used parallel genetic and immunological approaches to investigate the basis of CC042 susceptibility. Using a population derived from a CC001/Unc (CC001) x CC042 intercross, we mapped four QTL underlying Tuberculosis ImmunoPhenotypes (Tip1-4). These included 2 major effect QTL on Chromosome 7 (Tip1 and Tip2) that were associated with bacterial burden. Tip2, along with Tip3 (Chromosome 15) and Tip4 (Chromosome 16) also correlated with IFN{gamma} production following infection, whereas Tip1 appeared to control an IFN{gamma}-independent mechanism of bacterial control. Further immunological characterization revealed that CC042 animals recruited relatively few antigen-specific T cells to the lung and these T cells failed to express the Integrin alpha L (L; i.e., CD11a), which contributes to T cell activation and migration. These defects could be explained by a CC042 private variant in the Itgal gene, which encodes CD11a, and is found within the Tip2 interval. This 15bp deletion leads to aberrant mRNA splicing and is predicted to result in a truncated protein product. The ItgalCC042 genotype was associated with all measured disease traits, indicating that this variant is a major determinant of susceptibility in CC042. The combined effect of functionally distinct Tip variants likely explains the profound susceptibility of CC042 and highlights the multigenic nature of TB control in the Collaborative Cross.\\n\\nImportance statementThe variable outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection observed natural populations is difficult to model in genetically homogenous small animal models. The newly-developed Collaborative Cross (CC) represents a reproducible panel of genetically-diverse mice that display a broad range of phenotypic responses to infection. We explored the genetic basis of this variation, focusing on a CC line that is highly susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection. This study identified multiple quantitative trait loci associated with bacterial control and cytokine production, including one that is caused by a novel loss-of-function mutation in the Itgal gene that is necessary for T cell recruitment to the infected lung. These studies verify the multigenic control of mycobacterial disease in the CC panel, identify genetic loci controlling diverse aspects of pathogenesis, and highlight the utility of the CC resource.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder of largely unknown etiology. While several genetic risk factors have been identified, the involvement of epigenetics in the pathophysiology of PD is mostly unaccounted for. We conducted a histone acetylome-wide association study in PD, using brain tissue from two independent cohorts of cases and controls. Immunoblotting revealed increased acetylation at several histone sites in PD, with the most prominent change observed for H3K27, a marker of active promoters and enhancers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) further indicated that H3K27 hyperacetylation in the PD brain is a genome-wide phenomenon, with a strong predilection for genes implicated in the disease, including SNCA, PARK7, PRKN and MAPT. Integration of the ChIP-seq with transcriptomic data revealed that the correlation between promoter H3K27 acetylation and gene expression is attenuated in PD patients, suggesting that H3K27 acetylation may be decoupled from transcription in the PD brain. Our findings strongly suggest that dysregulation of histone acetylation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PD and identify novel epigenetic signatures associated with the disease.",

    "abstract": "Impediments to DNA replication threaten genome stability. The homologous recombination (HR) pathway is involved in the restart of blocked replication forks. Here, we used a new method to study at the molecular level the restart of replication in response to DNA topoisomerase I poisoning by camptothecin (CPT). We show that HR-mediated restart at the global genomic level occurs by a BIR-like mechanism that requires Rad52, Rad51 and Pol32. The Mus81 endonuclease, previously proposed to cleave blocked forks, is not required for replication restart in S phase but appears to be essential to resolve fork-associated recombination intermediates in G2/M as a step necessary to complete replication. We confirmed our results using an independent system that allowed us to conclude that this mechanism is independent of the accumulation of DNA supercoiling and DNA-protein crosslinks normally caused by CPT. Thus, we describe here a specific function for Mus81 in the processing of HR-restarted forks required to complete DNA replication.",
