    "abstract": "Depleting visceral sensory nerves affects pancreatic islet function, glucose metabolism and diabetes onset, but how islet endocrine cells interact with sensory neurons has not been studied. Here we show that the pancreatic islet is innervated by vagal sensory axons expressing substance P, calcitonin-gene related peptide, and serotonin receptor 5HT3R. Vagal neurons projecting to the pancreas terminate in the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract. These neurons respond to chemical but not mechanical stimulation of the pancreas. By recording activity from nodose neurons in vivo and from sensory axons in living pancreas slices, we show that sensory nerves respond to serotonin secreted from stimulated beta cells. Serotonin is co-released with insulin and therefore conveys information about the secretory state of beta cells via vagal afferent nerves. Our study thus establishes that pancreatic islets communicate with the brain using the neural route and identifies serotonin signaling as a peripheral transduction mechanism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe etiology of Parkinsons disease (PD) is largely unknown. Genome-wide transcriptomic studies in bulk brain tissue have identified several molecular signatures associated with the disease. While these studies have the potential to shed light into the pathogenesis of PD, they are also limited by two major confounders: RNA post mortem degradation and heterogeneous cell type composition of bulk tissue samples. We performed RNA sequencing following ribosomal RNA depletion in the prefrontal cortex of 49 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts. Using cell-type specific markers, we estimated the cell-type composition for each sample and included this in our analysis models to compensate for the variation in cell-type proportions.\\n\\nResultsRibosomal RNA depletion results in substantially more even transcript coverage, compared to poly(A) capture, in post mortem tissue. Moreover, we show that cell-type composition is a major confounder of differential gene expression analysis in the PD brain. Correcting for cell-type proportions attenuates numerous transcriptomic signatures that have been previously associated with PD, including vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, immune and mitochondrial function. Conversely, pathways related to endoplasmic reticulum, lipid oxidation and unfolded protein response are strengthened and surface as the top differential gene expression signatures in the PD prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nConclusionsDifferential gene expression signatures in PD bulk brain tissue are significantly confounded by underlying differences in cell-type composition. Modeling cell-type heterogeneity is crucial in order to unveil transcriptomic signatures that represent regulatory changes in the PD brain and are, therefore, more likely to be associated with underlying disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the mouse retina, two types of cone photoreceptors (cones) provide input to more than a dozen types of cone bipolar cells (CBCs). This transmission is modulated by a single horizontal cell (HC) type, the only interneuron in the outer retina. Horizontal cells form feedback synapses with cones and feedforward synapses with CBCs. However, the exact computational role of HCs is still debated. Along with performing global signaling within their laterally coupled network, HCs also provide local, cone-specific feedback. Specifically, it has not been clear which synaptic structures HCs use to provide local feedback to cones and global forward signaling to CBCs.\\n\\nHere, we reconstructed in a serial block-face electron microscopy volume the dendritic trees of five HCs as well as cone axon terminals and CBC dendrites to quantitatively analyze their connectivity. In addition to the fine HC dendritic tips invaginating cone axon terminals, we also identified \\\"bulbs\\\", short segments of increased dendritic diameter on the primary dendrites of HCs. These bulbs are located well below the cone axon terminal base and make contact to other cells mostly identified as other HCs or CBCs. Using immunolabeling we show that HC bulbs express vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters and co-localize with GABA receptor {gamma}2 subunits. Together, this suggests the existence of two synaptic strata in the mouse OPL, spatially separating cone-specific feedback and feedforward signaling to CBCs. A biophysics-based computational model of a HC dendritic branch supports the hypothesis that the spatial arrangement of synaptic contacts allows simultaneous local feedback and global feedforward signaling.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesA drug can treat multiple diseases, indicating that the treatment of the drug has certain patterns. In this paper, we studied the treatment pattern of drugs from a new perspective based on the action of drug and multi-layer network model (STAM). Diseases affect the gene expression in related tissues and each disease corresponds to a tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (TSPPI) network. Therefore, a drug is associated with a multi-layer TSPPI network associated with diseases it treats. Single tissue-specific PPI network cannot consider all disease-related information, leading to find the potential treatment pattern of drugs difficultly. Research on multi-layer networks can effectively solve this disadvantage. Furthermore, proteins usually interact with other proteins in PPI to achieve specific functions, such as causing disease. Hence, studying the drug treatment patterns is equivalent to study common module structures in the multi-layer TSPPI network corresponding to drug-related diseases. Knowing the treatment patterns of the drug can help to understand the action mechanisms of the drug and to identify new indications of the drug.\\n\\nMethodsIn this paper, we were based on the action of drug and multi-layer network model to study the treatment patterns of drugs. We named our method as STAM. As a case of our proposed method STAM, we focused on a study to trichostatin A (TSA) and three diseases it treats: leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Based on the therapeutic effects of TSA on various diseases, we constructed a tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (TSPPI) network and applied a multi-layer network module mining algorithm to obtain candidate drug-target modules. Then, using the genes affected by TSA and related to the three diseases, we employed Gene Ontology (GO), the modules significance, co-expression network and literatures to filter and analyze the identified drug-target modules. Finally, two modules (named as M17 and M18) were preserved as the potential treatment patterns of TSA.\\n\\nResultsThe processed results based on the above framework STAM demonstrated that M17 and M18 had strong potential to be the treatment patterns of TSA. Through the analysis of the significance, composition and functions of the selected drug-target modules, we validated the feasibility and rationality of our proposed method STAM for identifying the drug treatment pattern.\\n\\nConclusionThis paper studied the drug treatment pattern from a new perspective. The new method STAM used a multi-layer network model, which overcame the shortcomings of the single-layer network, and combined the action of drug. Research on drug treatment model provides new research ideas for disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has gained great momentum with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy, in which patients T lymphocytes are genetically manipulated to recognize tumor-specific antigens to increase tumor elimination efficiency. Improved CAR T cell immunotherapy requires a better understanding of the interplay between CAR T cell doses and tumor burden, administration protocol, toxicity, resistance to immunotherapy, among other features. We developed a three-compartment mathematical model to describe tumor response to CAR T cell immunotherapy in immunodeficient mouse models. It encompasses interactions between tumor cells, effector and long-term memory CAR T cells such as tumor induced immunosuppression effects, conversion of memory T cells into effector T cells in the presence of tumor cells, and individual specificities considered as uncertainties in the parameters of the model. The model was able to represent two different immunotherapy scenarios with different CAR receptors and tumor targets reported in the literature. Further in silico studies considering different dosing quantities and tumor burden showed that the proposed model can represent the three possible therapy outcomes: tumor elimination, equilibrium, and escape. We found that therapy effectiveness may also depend on small variations in the parameter values, regarded as intrinsic individual specificities, as T cell proliferation capacity, as well as immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment factors. These issues may significantly reduce the chance of tumor elimination. In this way, the developed model provides potential use for assessing different CAR T cell protocols and associated efficacy without further in vivo experiments.",

    "abstract": "Dietary composition and antibiotic use are known to have major impacts on the structure and function of the gut microbiome, often resulting in dysbiosis. Despite this, little research has been done to explore the role of host diet as a determinant of antibiotic-induced microbiome disruption.\n\nHere, we utilize a multi-omic approach to characterize the impact of Western-style diet consumption on ciprofloxacin-induced changes to gut microbiome community structure and transcriptional activity. We found that mice consuming a Western-style diet experienced a greater expansion of Firmicutes following ciprofloxacin treatment than those eating a control diet. At the transcriptional level, we found that ciprofloxacin induced a reduction in the abundance of TCA cycle transcripts on both diets, suggesting that carbon metabolism plays a key role in the response of the gut microbiome to this antibiotic. Despite this shared response, we observed extensive differences in the response of the microbiota to ciprofloxacin on each diet. In particular, at the whole-community level we detected an increase in starch degradation, glycolysis, and pyruvate fermentation following antibiotic treatment in mice on the Western diet, which we did not observe in mice on the control diet. Similarly, we observed diet-specific changes in the transcriptional activity of two important commensal bacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, involving diverse cellular processes such as nutrient acquisition, stress responses, and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. These findings demonstrate that host diet plays a key role in determining the extent of disruption of microbiome composition and function induced by antibiotic treatment.\n\nImportanceWhile both diet and antibiotics are individually known to have profound impacts on gut microbiome composition, little work has been done to examine the effect of these two factors combined. A number of negative health outcomes, including diabetes and obesity, are associated with diets high in simple sugars in fats but low in host-indigestible fiber, and some of these outcomes may be mediated by the gut microbiome. Likewise, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and the resulting dysbiosis is associated with many of the same detrimental side effects. Previous work has shown that nutrient availability, as influenced by host diet, plays an important role in determining the extent of antibiotic-induced disruption to the gut microbiome. Due to the growing incidence of disorders related to antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, it is essential to determine how the prevalence of high fat and sugar \"Western\"-style diets impacts the response of the microbiome to antibiotics.",

However, due to complex and uncertain brain connectivity features in the cognitive domains, it remains challenging to quantify functional brain connectomic changes during non-pharmacological interventions for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. We present a new quantitative functional brain network analysis of fMRI data based on the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G). This neural network-based model can effectively learn low-dimensional Gaussian distributions from the original high-dimensional sparse functional brain networks, quantify uncertainties in link prediction, and discover the intrinsic dimensionality of brain networks. Using the Wasserstein distance to measure probabilistic changes, we discovered that brain regions in the default mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal attention systems had relatively large variations during non-pharmacological training, which might provide distinct biomarkers for fine-grained monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration.",

Cell type enrichment patterns varied greatly among neuroinflammatory-related genes, which are known to play roles in alcohol dependence and neurodegeneration. Differential expression analysis identified cell type-specific genes with altered expression in alcoholics. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including both protein-coding and non-coding, were detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia.\\n\\nConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first single cell transcriptome analysis of alcohol-associated gene expression in any species, and the first such analysis in humans for any addictive substance.

    "abstract": "Foot strike pattern affects ankle joint work and Triceps Surae muscle-tendon dynamics during running. Whether these changes in muscle-tendon dynamics also affect Triceps Surae muscle energy consumption is still unknown. In addition, as the Triceps Surae muscle accounts for a substantial amount of the whole body metabolic energy consumption, changes in Triceps Surae energy consumption may affect whole body metabolic energy consumption. However, direct measurements of muscle metabolic energy consumption during dynamic movements is hard. Model-based approaches can be used to estimate individual muscle and whole body metabolic energy consumption based on Hill type muscle models. In this study, we use an integrated experimental and dynamic optimization approach to compute muscle states (muscle forces, lengths, velocities, excitations and activations) of 10 habitual mid-/forefoot striking and 9 habitual rearfoot striking runners while running at 10 and 14 km/h. The Achilles tendon stiffness of the musculoskeletal model was adapted to fit experimental ultrasound data of the Gastrocnemius medialis muscle during ground contact. Next, we calculated Triceps Surae muscle and whole body metabolic energy consumption using four different metabolic energy models provided in literature. Neither Triceps Surae metabolic energy consumption (p > 0.35), nor whole body metabolic energy consumption (p > 0.14) was different between foot strike patterns, regardless of the energy model used or running speed tested. Our results provide new evidence that mid-/forefoot and rearfoot strike pattern are metabolically equivalent.",

We examined what to do and how far to look, as a simple optimal control problem, where forward momentum is controlled to compensate for a step change in terrain height, and steady gait regained with no loss of time relative to nominal walking. We modeled planar, human-like walking with pendulum-like legs, and found the most economical control to be quite stereotypical. It starts by gaining momentum several footfalls ahead of an upward step, in anticipation of the momentum lost atop that step, and then ends with another speed-up to regain momentum thereafter. A similar pattern can be scaled to a variety of conditions, including both upward or downward steps, yet allow for considerably reduced overall energy and peak power demands, compared to compensation without anticipation. We define a \"persistence time\" metric from the transient decay response after a disturbance, to describe how momentum is retained between steps, and how far ahead a disturbance should be planned for. Anticipatory control of momentum can help to economically negotiate uneven terrain.",

    "abstract": "We propose an upgraded version of our previously designed open-source lipid bilayer amplifier. This improved amplifier is now suitable both for the use in introductory courses in biophysics and neurosciences at the undergraduate level and for scientific research. Similar to its predecessor, the OpenPicoAmp-100k is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. It consists of the high-speed headstage, followed by voltage-gain amplifier with built-in 6-order Bessel filter. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 100 kHz in the presence of 100 pF input membrane capacitance and is capable of measuring ion channel current with amplitudes from sub-pA and up to {+/-}4 nA. At the full bandwidth and with a 1 G{Omega} transimpedance gain, the amplifier shows 12 pArms noise with an open input and 112 pArms noise in the presence of 100 pF input capacitance, while at the 5 kHz bandwidth (typical in single-channel experiments) noise amounts to 0.45 pArms and 2.11 pArms, respectively. Using an optocoupler circuit producing TTL-controlled current impulses and using 50% threshold analysis we show that at full bandwidth the amplifier has deadtimes of 3.5 {micro}s and 5 {micro}s at signal-to-noise ratios(SNR) of 9 and 1.7, respectively. Near 100% of true current impulses longer than 5 {micro}s and 6.6 {micro}s are detected at these two respective SNRs, while false event detection rate remains acceptably low. The wide bandwidth of the amplifier was confirmed in bilayer experiments with alamethicin, for which open ion channel current events shorter that 10 {micro}s could be resolved.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) has emerged in hospitals due to the use of several agents administered in combination or sequentially to the same individual. We reported earlier MDR in Candida lusitaniae during therapy with amphotericin B (AmB), azoles and candins. We used here comparative genomic approaches between the initial susceptible isolate and 4 other isolates with different MDR profiles. From a total of 18 non-synonymous SNPs (NSS) in genome comparisons with the initial isolate, six could be associated with MDR. One of the SNPs occurred in a putative transcriptional activator (MRR1) resulting in a V668G substitution in isolates resistant to azoles and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). We demonstrated by gene editing that MMR1 acted by upregulation of MFS7 (a multidrug transporter) in the presence of the V668G substitution. MFS7 itself mediated not only azole resistance but also 5-FC resistance, which represents a novel resistance mechanism for this drug class. Three other distinct NSS occurred in FKS1 (a glucan synthase that is targeted by candins) in three candin-resistant isolates. Lastly, two other NSS in ERG3 and ERG4 (ergosterol biosynthesis) resulting in non-sense mutations were revealed in AmB-resistant isolates, one of which accumulated the 2 ERG NSS. AmB-resistant isolates lacked ergosterol and exhibited sterol profiles consistent with ERG3 and ERG4 defects. In conclusion, this genome analysis combined with genetics and metabolomics helped to decipher the resistance profiles identified in this clinical case. MDR isolates accumulated 6 different mutations conferring resistance to all antifungal agents used in medicine. This case study illustrates the capacity of C. lusitaniae to rapidly adapt under drug pressure within the host.\\n\\nImportanceAntifungal resistance is an inevitable phenomenon when fungal pathogens get exposed to antifungal drugs. These drugs can be grouped in 4 distinct classes (azoles, candins, polyenes, pyrimidine analogs) and are used in different clinical settings. Failures in therapy implicates the sequential or combined use of these different drug classes, which can result in some cases in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR is particularly challenging in the clinic since it drastically reduces possible treatment alternatives. In this study, we report the rapid development of MDR in Candida lusitaniae in a patient, which became resistant to all known antifungal agents used up to now in medicine. To understand how MDR developed in C. lusitaniae, whole genome sequencing followed by comparative genome analysis was undertaken in sequential MDR isolates. This helped to detect all specific mutations linked to drug resistance and explained the different MDR patterns exhibited by the clinical isolates.",

However, conventional ELISA is still not sensitive enough to detect ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer, cardiovascular risk, neurological disorders, and infectious diseases. Herein we show a mechanism utilizing the CRISPR/Cas13a-based signal export amplification strategy, which double-amplifies the output signal by T7 RNA polymerase transcription and CRISPR/Cas13a collateral cleavage activity. This process is termed the CRISPR/Cas13a signal amplification linked immunosorbent assay (CLISA). The proposed method was validated by detecting an inflammatory factor, human interleukin-6 (human IL-6), and a tumor marker, human vascular endothelial growth factor (human VEGF), which achieved limit of detection (LOD) values of 45.81 fg/mL (2.29 fM) and 32.27 fg/m (0.81 fM), respectively, demonstrating that CLISA is at least 102-fold more sensitive than conventional ELISA.",

We examined whether substance use risk factors, including dimensional measures of psychopathology (externalizing, internalizing) and family history of substance use disorder, were associated with developmental differences in inhibitory control performance and BOLD activation at both the trial-level and within individual antisaccade epochs (cue, preparation, and response). Among substance use risk factors, only externalizing psychopathology predicted developmental differences in inhibitory control, where high externalizing predicted lower correct response rates and faster latencies were observed in early adolescence, but normalized by late adolescence. Neuroimaging results revealed high externalizing was associated with developmentally-stable hypo-activation in the left middle frontal gyrus (trial-level), but divergent developmental patterns of posterior parietal cortex activation (cue epoch).

    "abstract": "After the presentation of a visual stimulus, cortical visual processing cascades from low-level sensory features in primary visual areas to increasingly abstract representations in higher-level areas. It is often hypothesized that the reverse process underpins the human ability to generate mental images. Under this hypothesis, visual information feeds back from high-level areas as abstract representations are used to construct the sensory representation in primary visual cortices. Such reversals of information flow are also hypothesized to play a central role in later stages of perception. According to predictive processing theories, ambiguous sensory information is resolved using abstract representations coming from high-level areas through oscillatory rebounds between different levels of the visual hierarchy. However, despite the elegance of these theoretical models, to this day there is no direct experimental evidence of the reversion of visual information flow during mental imagery and perception. In the first part of this paper, we provide direct evidence in humans for a reverse order of activation of the visual hierarchy during imagery. Specifically, we show that classification machine learning models trained on brain data at different time points during the early feedforward phase of perception are reactivated in reverse order during mental imagery. In the second part of the paper, we report an 11Hz oscillatory pattern of feedforward and reversed visual processing phases during perception. Together, these results are in line with the idea that during perception, the high-level cause of sensory input is inferred through recurrent hypothesis updating, whereas during imagery, this learned forward mapping is reversed to generate sensory signals given abstract representations.",

ClpXP is an important target for drug development against infectious diseases. Although structures are available for isolated ClpX and ClpP rings, it remains unknown how symmetry mismatched ClpX and ClpP work in tandem for processive substrate translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-bound ClpXP complex from Neisseria meningitidis at 2.3 to 3.3 [A] resolution. The structures allow development of a model in which the cyclical hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to concerted motions of ClpX loops that lead to directional substrate translocation and ClpX rotation relative to ClpP. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that AAA+ molecular machines generate translocating forces by a common mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Aseptic technique has historically served as a fundamental practice in microbiology, helping maintain culture purity and integrity. This technique has been widely encouraged and employed for use with cultures of heterotrophic bacteria as well as freshwater and marine algae. Yet, recent observations have suggested these approaches may bring their own influences. We observed variations in growth amongst replicate experimental cyanobacterial cultures upon flaming of the culture tube opening during sample transfer and collection. Investigation revealed the pH of culture media had decreased from the initial pH established during media preparation. Flaming of sterile culture media alone confirmed a significant decrease, by as much as 1.7 pH units, and correlated with increased flaming events over time. We hypothesized that the causative factor was the introduction of carbon dioxide into the media. To test this hypothesis, qualitative and quantitative analyses were used to identify the primary driver of pH decline. We further assessed the direct effects of flaming and subsequent pH changes on Microcystis aeruginosa cultures, showing flame-driven pH changes and/or the introduction of carbon dioxide influenced experimental results. Our observations provide a cautionary tale of how classic and well-accepted approaches may not always provide the results promised, suggesting new approaches may be necessary in research areas assessing pH or carbon related-effects on microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Host plasma membrane protein SERINC5 is incorporated into budding retrovirus particles where it blocks subsequent entry into susceptible target cells. Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7+ endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV) glycoproteins were sensitive to SERINC5, but only with particular retroviral cores. Resistance to SERINC5 by particular glycoproteins did not correlate with reduced SERINC5 incorporation into particles or with the route of viral entry. These findings indicate that some non-retroviruses may be sensitive to SERINC5 and that, in addition to the viral glycoprotein, the retroviral core influences sensitivity to SERINC5.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe importance of SERINC5 for inhibition of retroviruses is underscored by convergent evolution among three non-monophyletic retroviruses, each of which encodes a structurally unrelated SERINC5 inhibitor. One of these retroviruses causes tumors in mice, a second anemia in horses, and a third causes AIDS. SERINC5 is incorporated into retrovirus particles where it blocks entry into target cells, via a mechanism that is dependent on the viral glycoprotein. Here we demonstrate that retroviruses pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several non-retroviruses are also inhibited by SERINC5, suggesting that enveloped viruses other than retroviruses may also be inhibited by SERINC5. Additionally, we found that sensitivity to SERINC5 is determined by the retrovirus core, as well as by the glycoprotein. By better understanding how SERINC5 inhibits viruses we hope to extend fundamental understanding of virus replication and of the native role of SERINC5 in cells, and perhaps to advance the development of new antiviral strategies.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequence of Tricholoma matsutake was revealed as the one of the large fungal genomes published up to date at 189.0 Mbp with 15,305 predicted genes. The unusual size of this fungal genome contained frequent colonization of transposable elements (TEs) occupying more than half of the entire genome. We identified that 702 genes were surrounded by TEs and 83.2% of those genes were never transcribed at any development stage. This observation corroborated that the insertion of transposable elements alters the transcription of the genes neighboring TEs.\\n\\nRepeat-induced point mutation such as C to T hypermutation with a bias over CpG dinucleotides was also recognized in this genome, representing a typical defense mechanism against TEs during evolution. Many transcription factor genes were activated in both primordia and fruiting body, which indicates that many regulatory processes are shared during developmental stages. Small secreted protein genes (<300 aa) were dominantly transcribed in hyphae, where symbiotic interactions occur with hosts. Comparative analysis with 37 Agaricomycetes genomes revealed that IstB-like domain (PF01695) was conserved in taxonomically diverse mycorrhizal genomes, where the T. matsutake genome contained four copies of this domain. Three of the IstB-like genes were overexpressed in hyphae. In the CAZyme analysis, reduced CAZyme genes were found as other ectomycorrhizal genomes including a lot of loss of glycoside hydrolase genes. Also, auxiliary activity genes were dominantly transcribed in primordia. The T. matsutake genome sequence provides insight into the large genome size and clues to understand unusual fungal genome expansion.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with adaptive immune functions against viruses and other genetic parasites by leveraging small non-coding RNAs for nuclease-dependent degradation of their nucleic acid targets. In contrast to all other types of CRISPR-Cas systems, the mechanisms and biological roles of type IV systems have remained largely overlooked. Here, we describe a previously uncharted diversity of type IV gene cassettes, distributed across diverse prokaryotic genome backgrounds, and propose their classification into subtypes and variants. Congruent with recent findings, type IV modules were primarily found on plasmid-like elements. Remarkably, via a comprehensive analysis of their CRISPR spacer content, these systems were found to exhibit a strong bias towards the targeting of other plasmids. Our data indicate that the functions of type IV systems have diverged from those of other host-related CRISPR-Cas immune systems to adopt a yet unrecognised role in mediating conflicts between plasmids that compete to monopolize their hosts. Furthermore, we find evidence for cross-talk between certain type IV and type I CRISPR-Cas systems that co-exist intracellularly, thus providing an answer to the enigmatic absence of adaptation modules in these systems. Collectively, our results lead to the expansion and reclassification of type IV systems and provide novel insights into the biological function and evolution of these elusive systems.",

But bilinguals language control needs are themselves influenced by key dimensions of the bilingual experience - variation in the age of bilingualism-onset, relative language proficiency, exposure and immersion has indeed been shown to have differential effects on bilingual neurostructural profiles. An under-studied dimension of bilingualism that could also generate differing bilingual language control needs is the extent of similarity between bilinguals language pairs, referred to in the present study as Relative Language Distance (RLD). The goal of the present study was to explore whether the experience of managing \\\"close\\\" and \\\"distant\\\" languages has any impact at all on bilingual brain structure. To this end, exploratory morphometric analysis of grey matter volumes was carried out on three groups, all very similar in their bilingual profiles except for the factor of RLD - high-distance Cantonese-English (hd-CE), intermediate distance Hindi-English (id-HE) and low-distance Dutch-English (ld-DE) speakers. The results after controlling for contribution of other bilingual dimensions revealed significant bilateral putaminal volume differences between the groups that varied along the relative language distance gradient in the pattern of CE>HE>DE. This might be attributable to the differing articulatory control needs that variation in L1-L2 RLD generates. The present study reveals how the dimension of Relative Language Distance could impact bilingual brain structure.",

Bearing a Cre-LoxP induced exonic disruption of the murine Gaa gene, this model is also not amenable to genome-editing based therapeutic approaches. We report the early onset of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a novel murine IOPD model generated utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed recombination to harbor the orthologous Gaa mutation c.1826dupA (p.Y609*), which causes human IOPD. We demonstrate the dual sgRNA approach with a single-stranded oligonucleotide donor is highly specific for the Gaac.1826 locus without genomic off-target effects or rearrangements. Cardiac and skeletal muscle were deficient in Gaa mRNA and enzymatic activity and accumulated high levels of glycogen. The mice demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness but did not experience early mortality. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 generated Gaac.1826dupA murine model recapitulates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness of human IOPD, indicating its utility for evaluation of novel therapeutics.",

An open question, in particular where higher-level areas are involved, is how much tuning measured with one stimulus set reveals about tuning to a new set. Here we ask this question by estimating tuning to hue in macaque V4 from a set of natural scenes and a set of simple color stimuli. We found that hue tuning was strong in each dataset but was not correlated across the datasets, a finding expected if neurons have strong mixed selectivity. We also show how such mixed selectivity may be useful for transmitting information about multiple dimensions of the world. Our finding suggest that tuning in higher visual areas measured with simple stimuli may thus not generalize to naturalistic stimuli.\n\nNew & NoteworthyVisual cortex is often investigated by mapping neural tuning to variables selected by the researcher such as color. How much does this approach tell us a neurons general  role in vision? Here we show that for strongly hue-tuned neurons in V4, estimating hue tuning from artificial stimuli does not reveal the hue tuning in the context of natural scenes.

    "abstract": "Effector proteins delivered inside plant cells are powerful weapons for bacterial pathogens, but this exposes the pathogen to potential recognition by the plant immune system. Therefore, the effector repertoire of a given pathogen must be balanced for a successful infection. Ralstonia solanacearum is an aggressive pathogen with a large repertoire of secreted effectors. One of these effectors, RipE1, is conserved in most R. solanacearum strains sequenced to date. In this work, we found that RipE1 triggers immunity in N. benthamiana, which requires the immune regulator SGT1, but not EDS1 or NRCs. Interestingly, RipE1-triggered immunity induces the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and the overexpression of several genes encoding phenylalanine-ammonia lyases (PALs), suggesting that the unconventional PAL-mediated pathway is responsible for the observed SA biosynthesis. Surprisingly, RipE1 recognition also induces the expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes and JA biosynthesis, suggesting that both SA and JA may act cooperatively in response to RipE1. Finally, we found that RipE1 expression leads to the accumulation of glutathione in plant cells, which precedes the activation of immune responses. R. solanacearum encodes another effector, RipAY, which is known to inhibit immune responses by degrading cellular glutathione. Accordingly, we show that RipAY inhibits RipE1-triggered immune responses. This work shows a strategy employed by R. solanacearum to counteract the perception of its effector proteins by the plant immune system.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWTo elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for a variety of phenotypic traits encompassing binary, continuous, count, and survival outcomes, we propose a novel and flexible method to test for mediation that can simultaneously accommodate multiple genetic variants and different types of outcome variables. Specifically, we employ the intersection-union test approach combined with likelihood ratio test to detect mediation effect of multiple genetic variants via some mediator (for example, the expression of a neighboring gene) on outcome. We fit high-dimensional generalized linear mixed models under the mediation framework, separately under the null and alternative hypothesis. We leverage Laplace approximation to compute the marginal likelihood of outcome and use coordinate descent algorithm to estimate corresponding parameters. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the validity of our proposed method and substantial, up to 97%, power gains over alternative methods. Applications to real data for the study of Chlamydia trachomatis infection further showcase advantages of our method. We believe our proposed method will be of value and general interest in this post-GWAS era to disentangle the potential causal mechanism from DNA to phenotype for new drug discovery and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is carried out by a multi-protein machine called the replisome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replisome is composed of over 30 different proteins arranged into multiple subassemblies, each performing distinct activities. Synchrony of these activities is required for efficient replication and preservation of genomic integrity. How this is achieved is particularly puzzling at the lagging strand, where current models of the replisome architecture propose turnover of the canonical lagging strand polymerase, Pol {delta}, at every cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Here we established single-molecule fluorescence microscopy protocols to study the binding kinetics of individual replisome subunits in live S. cerevisiae. Our results show long residence times for most subunits at the active replisome, supporting a model where all subassemblies bind tightly and work in a coordinated manner for extended periods, including Pol {delta}, hence redefining the architecture of the active eukaryotic replisome.",

Overexpression of ELO2 increased complex sphingolipid with longer acyl chain, thus improved membrane integrity and osmotic tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for prenatal depression, there exists controversy over the adverse effects of SSRI use on fetal development. Few studies have adequately isolated outcomes due to SSRI exposure and those due to maternal psychiatric conditions. Here, we directly investigated the outcomes of exposure to widely-used SSRIs fluoxetine and citalopram on the developing nervous system of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, using an integrative experimental approach. We exposed tadpoles to low doses of citalopram and fluoxetine during a critical developmental period and found that the different groups of tadpoles displayed opposing behavioral effects. While both groups showed reduced schooling behavior, the fluoxetine group showed increased seizure susceptibility and reduced startle habituation. In contrast, the citalopram treated tadpoles had decreased seizure susceptibility and increased habituation. Both groups had abnormal dendritic morphology in the optic tectum, a brain area important for all three behaviors tested. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of tectal neurons showed no differences in synaptic function across groups; however, tectal cells from fluoxetine-treated tadpoles had decreased voltage gated K+ currents while cells in the citalopram group had increased K+ currents. Both the behavior and electrophysiological findings indicate that cells and circuits in the fluoxetine treated optic tecta are hyperexcitable, while the citalopram group exhibits decreased excitability. Taken all together, these results show that early developmental exposure to SSRIs is sufficient to induce neurodevelopmental effects, however these effects can be complex and vary depending on the SSRI used. This may explain some of the discrepancies across human studies, and further underscores the importance of serotonergic signaling for the developing nervous system.",

    "abstract": "The present study enumerates the effectiveness of ethanolic leaf extract of A. indica against circulating microfilariae (mf) of D. immitis in vivo of Canis familiaris. An ethanolic extract was prepared from the leaves of A. indica (EEA) and treated on dogs infected with the filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, the causative agent of canine cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis. Before treatment, all the infected dogs were vigilantly supervised for any natural fluctuation of mf count. Two doses; 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight/twice a day; both for 15 days were selected for in vivo tests along with a control group which received an empty capsule during the study period. The highest reduction of circulating mf was counted on day 60, showing mf reduction of 77.9% and 86.7% respectively for the two doses. Thereafter mf density increased with a minor change and maintained reduction of 49.5% and 64.1% on day 180 respectively. Additionally, no appreciable side effects in the treated dogs were recorded as evident from serum toxicity parameter analyses. In conclusion, the ethanolic formulation of A. indica leaves possesses considerable effectiveness against D. immitis in vivo with no toxic modification in the host after exposure. Thus, EEA appears to be a good alternative remedy against heartworm infection in infected dogs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRCTLacustrine goby (Gobiopterus lacustris) belongs to a genus of gobies that are small in size and endemic to freshwater, brackish waters or coastal environments around the Indian and Pacific oceans. To date, there are no genomic or transcriptomic studies on G. lacustris. Here, we constructed gonadal transcriptomes of G. lacustris for the first time and identified genes that may be involved in gonadal development and reproduction. In total, 60,657,644 and 52,016,136 clean reads were obtained from ovary and testis, respectively, using Illumina sequencing. Reads were assembled into 62,573 unigenes with N50 value of 3,082 bp and a mean length of 1,869 bp. A total of 47,891 (76.53%) unigenes were annotated in at least one of the seven databases that were used in this study. In addition, 38,550 SSRs (simple sequence repeat, microsatellite) were identified from 20,517 SSR containing sequences. Gene expression patterns in the testis and ovary were compared, and 10,954 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were identified. Of these genes, 2,383 were up-regulated in the testis and 8,571 were up-regulated in the ovary. RT-qPCR analysis of 14 selected genes showed patterns consistent with the transcriptome results. Numerous DEGs involved in gonadal development and gametogenesis were identified, including foxl2, dmrt1, cyp19a1a, inha, inhb, sycp2, zglp1, tdrp, zps and esra. Using GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, pathways involving regulation of gonadal development and gametogenesis also identified. This work represents the first gonadal transcriptomic analysis of G. lacustris and provides a valuable dataset for future research on the genes involved in reproduction of G. lacustris.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of blood glucose is an invasive, painful and costly practice in diabetes. Consequently, the search for a more cost-effective (reagent-free), non-invasive and specific diabetes monitoring method is of great interest. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy has been used in diagnosis of several diseases, however, applications in the monitoring of diabetic treatment are just beginning to emerge. Here, we used ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to evaluate saliva of non-diabetic (ND), diabetic (D) and diabetic 6U-treated of insulin (D6U) rats to identify potential salivary biomarkers related to glucose monitoring. The spectrum of saliva of ND, D and D6U rats displayed several unique vibrational modes and from these, two vibrational modes were pre-validated as potential diagnostic biomarkers by ROC curve analysis with significant correlation with glycemia. Compared to the ND and D6U rats, classification of D rats was achieved with a sensitivity of 100%, and an average specificity of 93.33% and 100% using bands 1452 cm-1 and 836 cm-1, respectively. Moreover, 1452 cm-1 and 836 cm-1 spectral bands proved to be robust spectral biomarkers and highly correlated with glycemia (R2 of 0.801 and 0.788, P < 0.01, respectively). Both PCA-LDA and HCA classifications achieved an accuracy of 95.2%. Spectral salivary biomarkers discovered using univariate and multivariate analysis may provide a novel robust alternative for diabetes monitoring using a non-invasive and green technology.",

    "abstract": "Resistance associated mutations (RAMs) threaten the long-term success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) outcomes for HIV-1 treatment. HIV-1 Integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have proven to be a viable option for highly specific HIV-1 therapy. The INSTI, Dolutegravir is recommended by the World Health Organization for use as first-line cART. This study aims to understand how RAMs affect the stability of IN, as well as the binding of the drug Dolutegravir to the catalytic pocket of the protein. Molecular modelling of HIV-1C IN was performed using the SWISS-MODEL webserver; with quality assessment performed using internal methods and external software tools. The site directed mutator webserver was used to predict destabilizing and/or stabilizing effects of known RAMs while FoldX confirmed any changes in protein energy upon introduction of mutation. Interaction analysis between neighbouring residues was done using PyMOL. Three randomly selected mutations were chosen for molecular dynamic simulation studies using Gromacs. Trajectory analysis included Root mean square deviation and fluctuation, Radius of gyration, Principal component analysis and Interaction analysis between Dolutegravir and protein residues. The structural quality assessment indicated high reliability of the HIV-1C IN tetrameric structure, with more than 90% confidence in modelled regions. Change in free energy for the G140S mutant indicated a stabilizing effect and simulation analysis showed it to affect structural stability and flexibility of the protein structure. This was further supported by the drug being expelled from the G140S mutant active site, as indicated by interaction analysis. Our findings suggest the G140S mutant has a strong effect on the HIV-1C IN protein structure and Dolutegravir binding and should be validated using laboratory-based experiments. This approach can be applied to determine the effect of other mutations/variants on HIV-1C integrase drug binding.",

APOBEC family proteins are highly homologous so it is especially difficult to investigate the biology of A3B alone in cancer cells. To investigate A3B function in myeloma cells easily and comprehensively, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate A3B reporter cells that contain 3xFLAG tag and IRES-EGFP sequences integrated at the end of the A3B gene. These reporter cells stably express 3xFLAG tagged A3B and the reporter EGFP and this expression is enhanced under known stimuli, such as PMA. Conversely, shRNA knockdown of A3B decreased EGFP fluorescence and 3xFLAG tagged A3B protein levels. We screened a series of anticancer treatments using these cell lines and identified that most conventional therapies, such as antimetabolites or radiation, exacerbated endogenous A3B expression, but recent molecular targeting drugs, including bortezomib, lenalidomide and elotuzumab, did not. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of ATM, ATR and DNA-PK suppressed the EGFP expression upon treatment with antimetabolites. These results suggest that DNA damage response triggers A3B expression through ATM, ATR and DNA-PK signaling.",

    "abstract": "Satellite DNAs are among the most abundant repetitive DNAs found in eukaryote genomes, where they participate in a variety of biological roles, from being components of important chromosome structures to gene regulation. Experimental methodologies used before the genomic era were not sufficient despite being too laborious and time-consuming to recover the collection of all satDNAs from a genome. Today, the availability of whole sequenced genomes combined with the development of specific bioinformatic tools are expected to foster the identification of virtually all of the \\\"satellitome\\\" from a particular species. While whole genome assemblies are important to obtain a global view of genome organization, most assemblies are incomplete and lack repetitive regions. Here, we applied short-read sequencing and similarity clustering in order to perform a de novo identification of the most abundant satellite families in two Drosophila species from the virilis group: Drosophila virilis and D. americana. These species were chosen because they have been used as a model to understand satDNA biology since early 70s. We combined computational tandem repeat detection via similarity-based read clustering (implemented in Tandem Repeat Analyzer pipeline - \\\"TAREAN\\\") with data from the literature and chromosome mapping to obtain an overview of satDNAs in D. virilis and D. americana. The fact that all of the abundant tandem repeats we detected were previously identified in the literature allowed us to evaluate the efficiency of TAREAN in correctly identifying true satDNAs. Our results indicate that raw sequencing reads can be efficiently used to detect satDNAs, but that abundant tandem repeats present in dispersed arrays or associated with transposable elements are frequent false positives. We demonstrate that TAREAN with its parent method RepeatExplorer, may be used as resources to detect tandem repeats associated with transposable elements and also to reveal families of dispersed tandem repeats.",
