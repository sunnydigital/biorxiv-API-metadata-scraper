    "abstract": "Bacterial endosymbionts evolve under strong host-driven selection. Factors influencing host evolution might affect symbionts in similar ways, potentially leading to correlations between the molecular evolutionary rates of hosts and symbionts. Although there is evidence of rate correlations between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, similar investigations of hosts and symbionts are lacking. Here we demonstrate a correlation in molecular rates between the genomes of an endosymbiont (Blattabacterium cuenoti) and the mitochondrial genomes of their hosts (cockroaches). We used partial genome data for multiple strains of B. cuenoti to compare phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary rates for 55 cockroach/symbiont pairs. The phylogenies inferred for B. cuenoti and the mitochondrial genomes of their hosts were largely congruent, as expected from their identical maternal and cytoplasmic mode of inheritance. We found a correlation between evolutionary rates of the two genomes, based on comparisons of root-to-tip distances and on comparisons of the branch lengths of phylogenetically independent species pairs. Our results underscore the profound effects that long-term symbiosis can have on the biology of each symbiotic partner.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed spatial navigation is fundamental for mobile animals and is generally attributed to Place Cells (PCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) of the Hippocampus. It was proposed recently that GCs optimally encode transitions in spatiotemporal sequences. However, a single scale of transitions exhibits unfavorable runtimes when planning long sequences. This issue is approached by observing a relationship to binary search and data structures to optimally accelerate it. Then, this insight is extended to biologically plausible neural representations. The resultant data structure is a scale-space that learns approximate transitions and has an optimal scale-increment of [Formula] between subsequent scales. Also, the results generalize beyond navigation and, thus, describe a general-purpose cortical data structure. Applied to navigation, it resembles multi-resolution path planning, a technique widely deployed in mobile robotics. In addition, the scale-space can be used to find short-cuts, shown in a simulated Morris water maze experiment. Finally, the results provoke a novel understanding of Theta Phase Precession (TPP).",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesEpigenetic mechanisms influence the development and maintenance of complex phenotypes and may also contribute to the evolution of species-specific phenotypes. With respect to skeletal traits, little is known about the gene regulation underlying these hard tissues or how tissue-specific patterns are associated with bone morphology or vary among species. To begin exploring these topics, this study evaluates one epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, in skeletal tissues from five nonhuman primate species which display anatomical and locomotor differences representative of their phylogenetic groups.\n\nMaterials and MethodsFirst, we test whether intra-specific variation in skeletal DNA methylation is associated with intra-specific variation in femur morphology. Second, we identify inter-specific differences in DNA methylation and assess whether these lineage-specific patterns may have contributed to species-specific morphologies. Specifically, we use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip to identify DNA methylation patterns in femur trabecular bone from baboons (n=28), macaques (n=10), vervets (n=10), chimpanzees (n=4), and marmosets (n=6).\n\nResultsSignificant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with a subset of morphological variants, but these likely have small biological effects and may be confounded by other variables associated with morphological variation. Conversely, several species-specific DMPs were identified, and these are found in genes enriched for functions associated with complex skeletal traits.\n\nDiscussionOverall, these findings reveal that while intra-specific epigenetic variation is not readily associated with skeletal morphology differences, some inter-specific epigenetic differences in skeletal tissues exist and may contribute to evolutionarily distinct phenotypes. This work forms a foundation for future explorations of gene regulation and skeletal trait evolution in primates.",

    "abstract": "How is semantic information stored in the human mind and brain? Some philosophers and cognitive scientists argue for vectorial representations of concepts, where the meaning of a word is represented as its position in a high-dimensional neural state space. At the intersection of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, a class of very successful distributional word vector models has developed that can account for classic EEG findings of language, i.e., the ease vs. difficulty of integrating a word with its sentence context. However, models of semantics have to account not only for context-based word processing, but should also describe how word meaning is represented. Here, we investigate whether distributional vector representations of word meaning can model brain activity induced by words presented without context. Using EEG activity (event-related brain potentials) collected while participants in two experiments (English, German) read isolated words, we encode and decode word vectors taken from the family of prediction-based word2vec algorithms. We find that, first, the position of a word in vector space allows the prediction of the pattern of corresponding neural activity over time, in particular during a time window of 300 to 500 ms after word onset. Second, distributional models perform better than a human-created taxonomic baseline model (WordNet), and this holds for several distinct vector-based models. Third, multiple latent semantic dimensions of word meaning can be decoded from brain activity. Combined, these results suggest that empiricist, prediction-based vectorial representations of meaning are a viable candidate for the representational architecture of human semantic knowledge.",

The upper part of the bloom was dominated by aerobic phototrophic Cyanobacteria, the middle and lower parts were dominated by anoxygenic purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiales) and green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiales), respectively. We found multiple uncultured phototrophic lineages and present metagenome-assembled genomes of two uncultured organisms within the Chlorobiales. Apparently, those Chlorobiales populations were affected by Microviridae viruses. We suggest a sulfur cycle within the bloom in which elemental sulfur produced by phototrophs is reduced to sulfide by Desulfuromonas sp. These findings improve our understanding of the ecology and ecophysiology of phototrophic blooms and their impact on biogeochemical cycles.",

In congenital myelin disorders, OL dysfunction or death results in loss of myelin. This causes progressive and irreversible impairment to motor and cognitive functions, and is amongst the most disabling neurological disorder.\n\nNeonatal engraftment by glial progenitor cells (GPCs) allows the robust myelination of congenitally dysmyelinated brain, thereby preserving brain function and quality of life of patients. However, endogenous sources of glial progenitors are hard to obtain without causing secondary injury, while use of exogenous sources such as embryonic stem cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells face considerable ethical and safety issues.\n\nTo circumvent such hurdles, we asked whether NG2+ cells in the bone marrow could be a potential cell source for GPCs. We successfully generated glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) from 3 donors using a 14- day induction protocol. The generated hBMSC-GPCs were highly enriched in OPC marker expression, including OLIG2, PDGFR, NG2, SOX10 and O4, and showed efficient differentiation into myelinogenic oligodendrocytes when transplanted into postnatal day 7 (P7) myelin-deficient shiverer mice. Remyelination of the shiverer mouse brain significantly extended lifespan and improved motor function.\n\nThe novel induction protocol described here provides a method for fast, simple and effective glial therapy for myelin disorders, overcoming existent hurdles of cell source restriction and time frame requirement.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/658997v8_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104a62corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@399a67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c81ee1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16374da_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights- Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be programmed to myelinating glia (GPCs, glial progenitor cells), via a novel 14-day in vitro induction protocol\n- Transplantation of these hBM-GPCs robustly remyelinated myelin deficient shiverer mice.\n- hBM-GPC transplant significantly extended lifespan, increased body weight and improved motor function",

    "abstract": "The complex microconnectivity of the mammalian brain underlies its computational abilities, and its vulnerability to injury and disease. It has been challenging to illuminate the features of this synaptic network due in part to the small size and exceptionally dense packing of its elements. Here we describe a rapid and accessible super-resolution imaging and image analysis workflow--SEQUIN--that identifies, quantifies, and characterizes central synapses in animal models and in humans, enabling automated volumetric imaging of mesoscale synaptic networks without the laborious production of large histological arrays. Using SEQUIN, we identify delayed cortical synapse loss resulting from diffuse traumatic brain injury. Similar synapse loss is observed in an Alzheimer disease model, where SEQUIN mesoscale mapping of excitatory synapses across the hippocampus identifies region-specific synaptic vulnerability to neurodegeneration. These results establish a novel, easily implemented and robust nano-to-mesoscale synapse quantification and molecular characterization method. They furthermore identify a mechanistic link--synaptopathy--between Alzheimer neurodegeneration and its best-established epigenetic risk factor, brain trauma.",

    "abstract": "Dioecious weeds (separate sexes) may benefit from a maximized outcrossing and optimal sex-specific resource allocation but there are costs associated with the evolution of this breeding system which can be exploited for long-term management of dioecious weeds. That is, seed production in dioecious species is contingent upon the co-occurrence and co-flowering of the two genders and can be further complicated by biases in sex ratio. We therefore explored the sex ratio and dimorphism in secondary sex characters in three populations of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) from California, Kansas and Texas and tested if water stress can change the sex expression and/or the synchrony of flowering (anthesis) between male and female plants. Sex ratio (proportion of males) was balanced and did not deviate from 1:1 in all experiments and populations (California, Kansas, Texas) when plants received normal watering. Male and female plants of A. palmeri did not differ in timing of emergence, plant height and relative growth rate. While the initiation of flowering (emergence of inflorescence) occurred earlier in males than females, females preceded males in timing of anthesis. Water stress delayed anthesis in males to a larger extent than females giving rise to an anthesis mismatch as large as seven days between the two sexes. Water stress induced a female sex expression in Kansas population giving rise to a female to male ratio of 1.78 which significantly differed from the equal 1:1 sex ratio. Our data provide the first evidence of sex lability and environment sex determination (ESD) in A. palmeri, suggesting manipulation of sex expression and phenological asynchrony as novel tools for ecological management of dioecious weeds.",

    "abstract": "Background and purposeBipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Several polymorphisms have been found to be implicated in the pathogenesis of BD, however, these loci have small effect sizes that fail to explain the high heritability of the disease. Here, we provide more insights into the genetic basis of BD by identifying the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their associated pathways and biological processes in post-mortem brain tissues of patients with BD.\\n\\nMethodsEight datasets were eligible for the differential expression analysis. We used six datasets for the discovery of the gene signature and used the other two for independent validation. We performed the multi-cohort analysis by a random-effect model using R and MetaIntegrator package.\\n\\nResultsThe initial analysis resulted in the identification of 126 DEGs (30 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated). We refined this initial signature by a forward search process and resulted in the identification of 22 DEGs (6 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated). We validated the final gene signature in the independent datasets and resulted in an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.756 and 0.76, respectively. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) which identified several biological processes and pathways related to BD including Ca transport, inflammation and DNA damage response.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings support the previous findings that link BD pathogenesis to abnormalities in glial inflammation and calcium transport and also identify several other biological processes not previously reported to be associated with the development of the disease. Such findings will improve our understanding of the genetic basis underlying BD and may have future clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Through the corpus callosum, interhemispheric communication is mediated by callosal projection (CP) neurons. Using retrograde labeling, we identified a population of layer 6 (L6) excitatory neurons as the main conveyer of transcallosal information in the monocular zone of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Distinct from L6 corticothalamic (CT) population, V1 L6 CP neurons contribute to an extensive reciprocal network across multiple sensory cortices over two hemispheres. Receiving both local and long-range cortical inputs, they encode orientation, direction, and receptive field information, while are also highly spontaneous active. The spontaneous activity of L6 CP neurons exhibits complex relationships with brain states and stimulus presentation, distinct from the spontaneous activity patterns of the CT population. The anatomical and functional properties of these L6 CP neurons enable them to broadcast visual and nonvisual information across two hemispheres, and thus play a major role in regulating and coordinating brain-wide activity events.",

Here, we have defined active promoters and enhancers for major cell types of the human brain. Whereas psychiatric disorders were primarily associated with regulatory regions in neurons, idiopathic Alzheimers disease (AD) variants were largely confined to microglia enhancers. Interactome maps connecting GWAS variants in cell type-specific enhancers to gene promoters revealed an extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer harboring AD-risk variants ablated BIN1 expression in microglia but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the genes likely to be influenced by non-coding variants in AD and suggest the probable brain cell types in which they function.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIdentification of cell type-specific regulatory elements in the human brain enables interpretation of non-coding GWAS risk variants.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease is characterized by a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, which are associated with altered neuronal activity in the beta band (13-30 Hz). Assessing beta band activity typically involves transforming the time-series to get the power of the signal in the frequency-domain. Such transformation assumes that the time-series can be reduced to a combination of steady-state sine-and cosine waves. However, recent studies have suggested that this approach masks relevant biophysical features in the beta band activity--for example, that the beta band exhibits transient bursts of high-amplitude activity.\\n\\nIn an exploratory study we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record cortical beta band activity to characterize how spontaneous cortical beta bursts manifest in Parkinsons patients ON and OFF dopaminergic medication, and compare this to matched healthy controls. From three minutes of MEG data, we extracted the time-course of beta band activity from the sensorimotor cortex and characterized high-amplitude epochs in the signal to test if they exhibited burst like properties. We then compared the rate, duration, inter-burst interval, and peak amplitude of the high-amplitude epochs between the Parkinsons patients and healthy controls.\\n\\nOur results show that Parkinsons patients OFF medication had a 6-17% lower beta bursts rate compared to healthy controls, while both the duration and the amplitude of the bursts were the same for Parkinsons patients and healthy controls and medicated state of the Parkinsons patients. These data thus support the view that beta bursts are fundamental underlying features of beta band activity, and show that changes in cortical beta band power in PD can be explained primarily by changes in the underlying burst rate. Importantly, our results also revealed a relationship between beta bursts rate and motor symptom severity in PD: a lower burst rate scaled with increased in severity of bradykinesia and postural/kinetic tremor. Beta burst rate might thus serve as neuromarker for Parkinsons disease that can help in the assessment of symptom severity in Parkinsons disease or evaluate treatment effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Biological aging is the dominant risk factor for most chronic diseases. Development of anti-aging interventions offers the promise of preventing many such illnesses simultaneously. Cellular stress resistance is an evolutionarily conserved feature of longevity. Here, we identify compounds that induced resistance to the superoxide generator paraquat (PQ), the heavy metal cadmium (Cd), and the DNA alkylator methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Some rescue compounds conferred resistance to a single stressor, while others provoked multiplex resistance. Induction of stress resistance in fibroblasts was predictive of longevity extension in a published large-scale longevity screen in C. elegans. Transcriptomic analysis implicated Nrf2 signaling in stress resistance provided by two protective compounds, cardamonin and AEG 3482. Molecules that conferred stress resistance also induced cellular inflammatory pathways, and other core pathways such as AMPK signaling. Small molecules identified in this work may represent attractive candidates to evaluate for their potential pro-health and pro-longevity effects in mammals.",

An exception are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) which can leave the ER even when misfolded and are routed to the vacuole/lysosome for degradation by largely unknown mechanisms linked to post-ER quality control. Using yeast as model organism, we show that Gas1*, an ER-exported misfolded GPI-AP, is diverted from the secretory pathway to endosomes for transport to the vacuole. However, Gas1* is not sorted into endosomal intraluminal vesicles but internalizes directly from the vacuolar membrane. There, the vacuolar protease Pep4, but not any other known vacuolar protease, is required for Gas1* internalization. Our data reveal novel and unexpected mechanisms for invaginations from the vacuolar membrane.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIER-exited misfolded GPI-anchored proteins are routed to the vacuole via endosomes but do not internalize into intraluminal vesicles\\nC_LIO_LIInternalization occurs directly from the vacuolar membrane into intravacuolar mobile structures\\nC_LIO_LIInternalization from the vacuolar membrane depends on the proteolytic activity of the vacuolar protease Pep4\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation depends on proper attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules prior to anaphase onset. The Ipl1/Aurora B kinase corrects improper attachments by phosphorylating kinetochore components and so releasing aberrant kinetochore-microtubule interactions. The localization of Ipl1 to kinetochores in budding yeast depends upon multiple pathways, including the Bub1/Bub3 pathway. We show here that in meiosis, Bub3 is crucial for correction of attachment errors. Depletion of Bub3 results in reduced levels of kinetochore-localized Ipl1, and concomitant massive chromosome mis-segregation caused by incorrect chromosome-spindle attachments. Depletion of Bub3 also results in shorter metaphase I and metaphase II due to premature localization of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores, which antagonizes Ipl1-mediated phosphorylation. We propose a new role for the Bub1-Bub3 pathway in maintaining the balance between kinetochore-localization of Ipl1 and PP1, a balance that is essential for accurate meiotic chromosome segregation and timely anaphase onset.\\n\\nSummaryCairo et al show that in S. cerevisiae meiosis, spindle checkpoint proteins Bub1 and Bub3 have an essential role in preventing chromosome mis-segregation and setting the normal duration of anaphase I and anaphase II onset by regulating the kinetochore-localization of Ipl1 and PP1.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) modulate the responses of the Basolateral amygdala (BLA) to stress, and are associated respectively with the development of stress resilience and vulnerability. We characterized the persistent effects of repeated NPY and CRF treatment on the structure and function of BLA principal neurons (PN) in a novel organotypic slice culture (OTC) model of rat BLA, and examined the contributions of specific NPY receptor subtypes to these neural and behavioral effects. In BLA principal neurons within the OTCs, repeated NPY treatment caused persistent attenuation of excitatory input and induced dendritic hypotrophy via Y5 receptors; conversely, CRF increased excitatory input and induced hypertrophy of BLA PNs. Repeated treatment of OTCs with NPY followed by an identical treatment with CRF, or vice versa inhibited or reversed all structural changes in OTCs. These structural responses to NPY or CRF required calcineurin or CaMKII, respectively. Finally, repeated intra-BLA injections of NPY or a Y5 receptor agonist increased social interaction and recapitulated structural changes in BLA neurons seen in OTCs, while a Y5 receptor antagonist prevented NPYs effects both on behavior and on structure. These results implicate the Y5 receptor in the long-term, anxiolytic-like effects of NPY in the BLA, consistent with an intrinsic role in stress buffering, and highlight a remarkable mechanism by which BLA neurons may adapt to different levels of stress. Moreover, BLA OTCs offer a robust model to study mechanisms associated with resilience and vulnerability to stress in BLA.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWithin the basolateral amygdala (BLA), Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is associated with buffering the neural stress response induced by CRF, and promoting stress resilience. We used a novel organotypic slice culture (OTC) model of BLA, complemented with in vivo studies, to examine the cellular mechanisms associated with the actions of NPY. In OTCs, repeated NPY treatment reduces the complexity of the dendritic extent of anxiogenic BLA principal neurons, making them less excitable. NPY, via activation of Y5 receptors, additionally inhibits and reverses the increases in dendritic extent and excitability induced by the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). This NPY-mediated neuroplasticity indicates that resilience or vulnerability to stress may thus involve neuropeptide-mediated dendritic remodeling in BLA PNs.",
