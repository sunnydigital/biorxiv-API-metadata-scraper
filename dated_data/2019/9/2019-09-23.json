It is therefore important to understand how their metabolism is regulated to better define the components involved in the development of various human diseases. In the present work, we described the development and validation of an HPTLC method allowing the separation and quantification of free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, non-esterified fatty acids, and triglycerides.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are folded into loops. It is thought that these are formed by cohesin complexes via extrusion, either until loop expansion is arrested by CTCF or until cohesin is removed from DNA by WAPL. Although WAPL limits cohesins chromatin residence time to minutes, it has been reported that some loops exist for hours. How these loops can persist is unknown. We show that during G1-phase, mammalian cells contain acetylated cohesinSTAG1 which binds chromatin for hours, whereas cohesinSTAG2 binds chromatin for minutes. Our results indicate that CTCF and the acetyltransferase ESCO1 protect a subset of cohesinSTAG1 complexes from WAPL, thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops, and that ESCO1, like CTCF, contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping. Our data are consistent with a model of nested loop extrusion, in which acetylated cohesinSTAG1 forms stable loops between CTCF sites, demarcating the boundaries of more transient cohesinSTAG2 extrusion activity.",

Hence, we initiated a functional genomics study by applying RNA-seq. Testicular biopsies collected from donors with Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA), Obstructive Azoospermia (OA), Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens (CBAVD), and Varicocele (VA) conditions. Strong association of 100+ genes with human spermatogenesis and NOA has been detected via NGS-based transcriptomic analysis. In addition, 20 RNA molecules have been short-listed for potential diagnostic applications (non-obstructive azoospermia vs. obstructive azoospermia, varicocele or normal). A hierarchical list of several genes and alternatively spliced mRNAs, transcribed differentially in NOA, is reported - based on a  strength of association. Such association with NOA, spermatogenesis or both is a new finding for many genes as revealed by a comparison with a newly prepared comprehensive list of genes having such association with human spermatogenesis/NOA. Many top-ranking genes involved in viral gene expression were up-regulated in testes from NOA-patients, while those associated with an antiviral mechanism were down-regulated. A tangential finding: while most well-established control mRNAs did not qualify, two new ones worked best in RT-qPCR experiments. Needle-aspiration of testicular biopsies, followed by the use of short-listed promising candidate biomarkers (i.e., 16 mRNA & 4 chimeric transcripts) and control mRNAs in RT-qPCR-based diagnostic assays, may help to avoid open surgeries in future.",

    "abstract": "Muscle tissue shows circadian variation, but whether and how the intracellular circadian clock per se regulates muscle growth remains unclear. By measuring muscle growth over 12 h periods, here we show that muscle grows more during the day than at night. Inhibition of muscle contraction reduces growth to a similar extent in day and night, but does not ablate the circadian variation in growth. Muscle protein synthesis is higher during the day compared to night, whereas markers of protein degradation are higher at night. Mechanistically, the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin inhibits the extra daytime growth, but no effect on muscle growth at night was detected. Conversely, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 increases muscle growth at night, but has no effect during the day, irrespective of activity. Ablation of contractile activity rapidly reduces muscle protein synthesis both during the day and at night and leads to a gradual increase in Murf gene expression without ablating circadian variation in growth. Removal of circadian input by exposure to either permanent light or permanent darkness reduces muscle growth. We conclude that circadian variation in muscle growth is independent of the presence of, or changes in, physical activity and affects both protein synthesis and degradation in distinct circadian phases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVector-borne diseases are important causes of mortality and morbidity in humans and livestock, particularly for poorer communities and countries in the tropics. Large-scale programs against these diseases, for example malaria, dengue and African trypanosomiasis, include vector control, and assessing the impact of this intervention requires frequent and extensive monitoring of disease vector abundance. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases are low.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe developed a system that allows the identification of monitoring sites where pre-intervention densities of vectors are predicted to be high, and travel cost to sites is low, highlighting the most efficient locations for longitudinal monitoring. Using remotely sensed imagery and an image classification algorithm, we mapped landscape resistance associated with on- and off-road travel for every gridded location (3m and 0.5m grid cells) within Koboko district, Uganda. We combine the accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine the most efficient locations for longitudinal data collection. Our modelled predictions were validated against empirical measurements of travel-time and existing maps of road networks. We applied this approach in northern Uganda where a large-scale vector control program is being implemented to control human African trypanosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse flies. Our accessibility surfaces indicate a high performance when compared to empirical data, with remote sensing identifying a further ~70% of roads than existing networks.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceBy integrating such estimates with predictions of tsetse abundance, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal placement of sentinel monitoring sites for evaluating control programme efficacy, moving from a nuanced, ad-hoc approach incorporating intuition, knowledge of vector ecology and local knowledge of geographic accessibility, to a reproducible, quantifiable one.\n\nAuthor SummaryAssessing the impact of vector control programmes requires longitudinal measurements of the abundance of insect vectors within intervention areas. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases of disease are low. Efficient monitoring involves a prior selection of monitoring sites that are easy to reach and produce rich information on vector abundance. Here, we used image classification and cost-distance algorithms to produce estimates of accessibility within Koboko district, Uganda, where vector control is contributing to the elimination of sleeping sickness, a neglected tropical disease (NTD). We combine an accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine locations which are associated with low cost (lowest travel time) and potential for longitudinal data collection (high pre-intervention abundance). Our method could be adapted for use in the planning and monitoring of tsetse- and other vector-control programmes. By providing methods to ensure that vector control programmes operate at maximum efficiency, we can ensure that the limited funding associated with some of these NTDs has the largest impact.",

Its theoretical basis allows accurate predictions of offspring sex ratios in many species, but the mechanisms by which sex allocation is controlled are poorly understood. Using previously published data we investigated if alternative splicing, combined with differential expression, were involved with sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. We found that sex allocation is not controlled by alternative splicing but changes in gene expression, that were identified to be involved with oviposition, were shown to be similar to those involved in sperm motility, and capacitation. Genes involved in Cholesterol efflux, a key component of capacitation, along with calcium transport, trypsin and MAPKinase activity were regulated in ovipositing wasps. The results show evidence for regulation of sperm motility and of capacitation in an insect which, in the context of the physiology of the N. vitripennis spermatheca, could be important for sex allocation.",

    "abstract": "We developed a low-cost method for the production of Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries that allows up to 14 times more libraries for high-throughput Illumina sequencing to be generated for the same cost. We call this new method Hackflex. Quality of library preparation was tested by constructing libraries from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA using either Hackflex, standard Nextera Flex or a variation of standard Nextera Flex in which the bead-linked transposase is diluted prior to use. In order to test the library quality for genomes with a higher and a lower GC content, library construction methods were also tested on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus ATCC25923, respectively. We demonstrated that Hackflex can produce high quality libraries and yields a highly uniform coverage, equivalent to the standard Nextera Flex kit. We show that strongly size selected libraries produce sufficient yield and complexity to support de novo microbial genome assembly, and that assemblies of the large insert libraries can be much more contiguous than standard libraries without strong size selection. We introduce a new set of sample barcodes that are distinct from standard Illumina barcodes, enabling Hackflex samples to be multiplexed with samples barcoded using standard Illumina kits. Using Hackflex, we were able to achieve a per sample reagent cost for library prep of A$7.22 (USD$5.60), which is 9.87 times lower than the Standard Nextera Flex protocol at advertised retail price. An additional simple modification and further simplification of the protocol by omitting the wash step enables a further price reduction to reach an overall 14-fold cost saving. This method will allow researchers to construct more libraries within a given budget, thereby yielding more data and facilitating research programs where sequencing large numbers of libraries is beneficial.",

How TCR signalling pathways regulate Nr4a receptors and their sensitivities to different physiological types of TCR signalling (e.g. tonic versus activating) remains unknown. Here we utilise Nr4a1/Nur77-GFP and Nr4a3-Tocky mice to elucidate the signalling pathways that govern Nr4a receptor expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our findings reveal that Nr4a1-3 are Src family kinase-dependent. Moreover, Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 are abolished by calcineurin inhibitors and bind NFAT1, highlighting a necessary and sufficient role for NFAT in the control of Nr4a2 and Nr4a3, but redundancy for NFAT for Nr4a1. During T cell development, Nr4a1 is activated by tonic signalling during TCR-beta selection in the thymus, whilst Nr4a3 requires cognate peptide:MHC interactions for expression. Thus, due to differential sensitivity of Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 to TCR signalling pathways, T cells undergoing tonic versus activating TCR signalling events can be distinguished in vivo.",

Here, we characterize microbial community assembly in 52 Tsimane infant-mother pairs, using longitudinally collected stool and tongue swab samples profiled with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The Tsimane are an indigenous Bolivian population who practice infant care associated behaviors expected to increase mother-infant dispersal. Infant consumption of dairy products, vegetables, and chicha (a fermented drink inoculated with oral microbes) was significantly associated with gut microbiota composition. At both body sites, maternal microbes at higher relative abundance were more likely to be shared. Shared microbes were also higher in abundance in infants at both body sites, but decreased in average relative abundance with age and were not significantly higher by 12 months of age. Infant microbiotas were modeled using a neutral community model of assembly, which showed that the prevalence of more than two thirds of infant-colonizing microbes could be explained using neutral processes alone. The same method was applied to datasets from Finnish and Bangladeshi infants, confirming that the majority of microbes colonizing infants from different countries were neutrally distributed. Among the Tsimane infant and adult gut microbiota samples, neutral processes were less prominent in villages with more market access. These results underscore the importance of neutral processes during infant microbiota assembly, and suggest that cultural changes associated with market integration may be affecting traditional modes of microbiota assembly by decreasing the role of these neutral processes, perhaps through changes in diet, sanitation, or access to medical care.",

    "abstract": "Ventral visual cortex exhibits highly organized and selective patterns of functional activity associated with visual processing. However, this specialization decreases in normal aging, with functional responses to different visual stimuli becoming more similar with age, a phenomenon termed \"dedifferentiation\". The current study tested the hypothesis that age-related degradation of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a white matter pathway involved in visual perception, could account for dedifferentiation of both localized and distributed brain activity in ventral visual cortex. Participants included 281 adults, ages 20-89, from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging to measure white matter diffusivity, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional selectivity to viewing photographs from different categories (e.g., faces, houses). In general, decreased ILF anisotropy significantly predicted both focal and broad functional dedifferentiation. Specifically, there was a localized effect of structure on function, such that decreased anisotropy in a smaller mid-fusiform region of ILF predicted less selective (i.e., more dedifferentiated) response to viewing faces in a proximal face-responsive region of fusiform. On the other hand, the whole ILF predicted less selective response across broader ventral visual cortex for viewing animate (e.g., human faces, animals) versus inanimate (e.g., houses, chairs) images. This structure-function relationship became weaker with age and was no longer significant after age 70. These findings indicate that decreased white matter anisotropy is associated with maladaptive differences in proximal brain function and is an important variable to consider when interpreting age differences in functional selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Advances in neural recording methods enable sampling from populations of thousands of neurons during the performance of behavioral tasks, raising the question of how recorded activity relates to the theoretical models of computations underlying performance. In the context of decision making in rodents, patterns of functional connectivity between choice-selective cortical neurons, as well as broadly distributed choice information in both excitatory and inhibitory populations, were recently reported [1]. The straightforward interpretation of these data suggests a mechanism relying on specific patterns of anatomical connectivity to achieve selective pools of inhibitory as well as excitatory neurons. We investigate an alternative mechanism for the emergence of these experimental observations using a computational approach. We find that a randomly connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons generates single-cell selectivity, patterns of pairwise correlations, and indistinguishable excitatory and inhibitory readout weight distributions, as observed in recorded neural populations. Further, we make the readily verifiable experimental predictions that, for this type of evidence accumulation task, there are no anatomically defined sub-populations of neurons representing choice, and that choice preference of a particular neuron changes with the details of the task. This work suggests that distributed stimulus selectivity and patterns of functional organization in population codes could be emergent properties of randomly connected networks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhat can we learn about neural circuit organization and function from recordings of large populations of neurons? For example, in population recordings in the posterior parietal cortex of mice performing an evidence integration task, particular patterns of selectivity and correlations between cells were observed. One hypothesis for an underlying mechanism generating these patterns is that they follow from intricate rules of connectivity between specific neurons, but this raises the question of how such intricate patterns arise during learning or development. An alternative hypothesis, which we explore here, is that such patterns emerge from networks with broad spectra of eigenvalues, which is a generic property of certain random networks. We find that a random network model matches many features of experimental recordings, from single cells to populations. We suggest that such emergent selectivity could be an important principle in brain areas, in which a broad distribution of selectivity is observed.",

    "abstract": "M2 of influenza virus functions as proton channel during virus entry. In addition, an amphipathic helix in its cytoplasmic tail plays a role during budding. It targets M2 to the assembly site where it inserts into the inner membrane leaflet to induce curvature that causes virus scission. Since vesicularisation of membranes can be performed by a variety of amphiphilic peptides we used reverse genetics to investigate whether they can substitute for M2s helix.\\n\\nVirus could not be generated if M2s helix was deleted or replaced by a peptide predicted not to form an amphiphilic helix. In contrast, viruses could be rescued if the M2 helix was exchanged by helices known to induce membrane curvature. Infectious virus titers were marginally reduced if M2 contains the helix of the amphipathic lipid packing sensor, from the Epsin N-Terminal Homology domain or the non-natural membrane inducer RW16. Transmission EM of infected cells did not reveal unequivocal evidence that virus budding or membrane scission was disturbed in any of the mutants. Instead, individual virus mutants exhibit other defects in M2, such as reduced surface expression, incorporation into virus particles and ion channel activity. The protein composition and specific infectivity was also altered for mutant virions. We conclude that the presence of an amphiphilic helix in M2 is essential for virus replication, but other helices can replace its basic (curvature-inducing) function.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza is unique among enveloped viruses since it does not rely on the cellular ESCRT-machinery for budding. Instead viruses encode their own scission machine, the M2 protein. M2 is targeted to the edge of the viral assembly site where it inserts an amphiphilic helix into the membrane to induce curvature. Cellular proteins utilize a similar mechanism for scission of vesicles. We show that the helix of M2 can be replaced by helices from cellular proteins with only small effects on virus replication. No evidence was obtained that budding is disturbed, but individual mutants exhibit other defects in M2 which explain the reduced virus titers. In contrast, no virus could be generated if the helix of M2 is deleted or replaced by irrelevant sequences. These experiments support the concept that M2 requires an amphiphilic helix to induce membrane curvature, but its biophysical properties are more important than the amino acid sequence.",

    "abstract": "The MAT locus of Cryptococcus neoformans has a bipolar organization characterized by an unusually large structure, spanning over 100 kb. MAT genes have been characterized by functional genetics as being involved in sexual reproduction and virulence. However, classical gene replacement failed to achieve mutants for five MAT genes (RPL22, RPO41, MYO2, PRT1, RPL39), indicating that they are likely essential. In the present study, targeted gene replacement was performed in a diploid strain for both the  and a alleles of the ribosomal genes RPL22 and RPL39. Mendelian analysis of the progeny confirmed that both RPL22 and RPL39 are essential for viability. Ectopic integration of the RPL22 allele of opposite MAT identity in the heterozygous RPL22a/rpl22{Delta} or RPL22/rpl22a{Delta} mutant strains failed to complement their essential phenotype. Evidence suggests that this is due to differential expression of the RPL22 genes, and an RNAi-dependent mechanism that contributes to control RPL22a expression. Furthermore, via CRISPR/Cas9 technology the RPL22 alleles were exchanged in haploid MAT and MATa strains of C. neoformans. These RPL22 exchange strains displayed morphological and genetic defects during bilateral mating. These results contribute to elucidate functions of C. neoformans essential mating type genes that may constitute a type of imprinting system to promote inheritance of nuclei of both mating types.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) is a chemical-independent method that can reduce pathogens. Although soil microbes play essential roles in ASD, the relationship between the microbial community structure and disinfestation efficiency remains unclear. To this end, we investigated changes in the microbial community and pathogen density during a period of ASD under field conditions for 14 days in a greenhouse using three different substrates. Soil samples were collected at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after ASD treatment. The pathogen densities were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reactions, prokaryotic community analysis was conducted using unidirectional pyrosequencing, and the factors related to pathogen density were statistically analyzed. The pathogen density rapidly decreased by >90% at 3 days after treatment and then slowly decreased until day 14, but the rate of decrease differed among the substrates. The microbial communities became altered after 3 days and recovered to their original state on day 14. The dipyridyl reaction, microbial diversity, richness, and community structure were not correlated with pathogen density. The most negatively correlated operational taxonomic units with pathogen density were Clostridia and Bacilli, both belonging to Firmicutes. These results suggested that the growth of specific microbes, but not the changes in microbial community structure, might be important for ASD disinfestation efficiency.",

We proposed that it acts according to two successive steps: 1-canonical non-homologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) versus single-strand DNA (ssDNA) resection; 2- on ssDNA, gene conversion (GC) versus non-conservative single-strand annealing (SSA) or alternative end-joining (A-EJ).\\n\\nUsing intramolecular substrates, we systematically analysed the equilibrium between the different DSB repair pathways. We show that ablation of RAD51 stimulated both SSA and A-EJ but did not stimulate C-NHEJ, validating the two-step model. Moreover, we found that two ATP-mutant dominant-negative forms of RAD51 that stimulated non-conservative repair, failed to load into damaged chromatin, clarifying the role of ATP in RAD51-mediated HR, also. In contrast, another dominant-negative form of RAD51, which retains its DNA binding capacities, repressed SSA and A-EJ, revealing two separable functions of RAD51 i.e. GC and non-conservative repair inhibition. In vitro assays show that the binding of RAD51 on both complementary ssDNA is required to block both spontaneous and RAD52-induced strand annealing. Therefore, RAD51 represses non-conservative repair (SSA and A-EJ), by inhibiting the annealing step through ssDNA occupancy, independently of the catalytic strand-exchange activity required for GC.",

    "abstract": "Echo planar imaging (EPI) is a fast and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that supports data acquisition at spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for brain function studies. However, susceptibility artifacts are unavoidable distortions in EPI. These distortions are especially strong in high spatial resolution images and can lead to misrepresentation of brain function in fMRI experiments. A common method for correcting susceptibility artifacts is based on a registration scheme which uses two EPI images acquired using identical sequences but with inverse phase-encoding (PE) directions. In this paper, we present a new method for correcting susceptibility artifacts by integrating a T1-weighted (T1w) image into the inverse-PE based registration, since the T1w structural image is considered as a ground-truth measurement of the brain. Furthermore, the T1w image is used as a criterion to select automatically the regularization parameters of the proposed image registration. Evaluations on two high-resolution EPI-fMRI datasets, acquired at 3T and 7T scanners, confirm that the proposed method provides more robust and sharper corrections and runs faster compared with two other state-of-the-art inverse-PE based susceptibility artifact correction methods, i.e. HySCO and TOPUP.",

We have evaluated the performance of DAVI against existing state of the art tool-set and found that its accuracy and performance is comparable to existing tools used for benchmarking. We further demonstrate that while existing tools are based on data generated from a specific sequencing technology, the models proposed in DAVI are generic and can be used across different NGS technologies. Moreover, this approach is a migration from expert driven statistical models to generic, automated, self-learning models.",

    "abstract": "A small number of peptide growth factor ligands are used repeatedly in development and homeostasis to drive programs of cell differentiation and function. Cells and tissues must integrate inputs from these diverse signals correctly, while failure to do so leads to pathology, reduced fitness, or death. Previous work using the nematode C. elegans identified an interaction between the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathways in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. The molecular components required for this interaction, however, were not known. Here we report that INS-4, one of 40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs), is regulated by BMP signaling to modulate fat accumulation. Furthermore, we find that the IIS transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO, but not SKN-1/Nrf, acts downstream of BMP signaling in lipid homeostasis. Interestingly, BMP activity alters sensitivity of these two transcription factors to IIS-promoted cytoplasmic retention in opposite ways. Finally, we probe the extent of BMP and IIS interactions by testing two additional IIS functions, dauer formation and autophagy induction. Coupled with our previous work and that of other groups, we conclude that BMP and IIS pathways have at least three modes of interaction: independent, epistatic, and antagonistic. The molecular interactions we identify provide new insight into mechanisms of signaling crosstalk and potential therapeutic targets for IIS-related pathologies such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome.",

However, conventional gene annotations specify the boundaries of mRNAs, which significantly differ from the boundaries of primary transcripts. Moreover, transcript isoforms with distinct transcription start and end coordinates can vary between cell types. Therefore, new primary transcript annotations are needed to accurately interpret run-on data. We developed the primaryTranscriptAnnotation R package to infer the transcriptional start and termination sites of annotated genes from genomic run-on data. We then used these inferred co-ordinates to annotate transcriptional units identified de novo. Hence, this package provides the novel utility to integrate data-driven primary transcript annotations with transcriptional unit coordinates identified in an unbiased manner. Our analyses demonstrated that this new methodology increases the sensitivity for detecting differentially expressed transcripts and provides more accurate quantification of RNA polymerase pause indices, consistent with the importance of using accurate primary transcript coordinates for interpreting genomic nascent transcription data.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/WarrenDavidAnderson/genomicsRpackage/tree/master/primaryTranscriptAnnotation",

The aim of this study was to inform policy on preparedness planning for pandemic influenza based on the assessment of a wide range of scenarios and free from restrictive assumptions about timing and features of the next pandemic.\\n\\nWe carried out epidemiological modelling and health economic analysis of an extensive set of scenarios, each comprising a combination of pandemic, vaccine and immunisation programme characteristics in presence or absence of access to effective antivirals. Preparedness policies that incorporate mass immunisation were evaluated on the basis of there being a given chance of a pandemic each year.

Preparedness plans incorporating mass immunisation show positive net present value for a wide range of pandemic scenarios, predominantly in the absence of effective antivirals. Plans based on the responsive purchase of vaccine have greater benefit than plans reliant on the purchase and maintenance of a stockpile if immunisation can start without extensive delays. This finding is not dependent on responsively purchased vaccine being more effective than stockpiled vaccine, but rather is driven by avoiding the costs of storing and replenishing a stockpile.\\n\\nWhile emerging technologies for rapid vaccine development and production increase the prospects for mass immunisation to be an effective countermeasure, policies based on the responsive purchase of vaccine not tailored to the pandemic should be explored. Focus is also required on the pandemic intelligence, decision, contractual and logistical processes on which timely commencement of immunisation in a pandemic is reliant.",

Through interacting with extracellular matrix components and growth factors via one of its four domains, the CCN proteins are involved in critical biological processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, bone development, fibrogenesis, and tumorigenesis. We present here the crystal structure of the thrombospondin module 1 (TSP1) domain of CCN3 (previously known as Nov), which shares a similar three-stranded fold with the thrombospondin type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 and Spondin-1, but with variations in the disulfide connectivity. Moreover, the CCN3 TSP1 lacks the typical pi-stacked ladder of charged and aromatic residues on one side of the domain, as seen in other TSP1 domains. Using conservation analysis among orthologous domains, we show that a charged cluster in the centre of the domain is the most conserved site and predict it to be a potential functional epitope for heparan sulphate binding. This variant TSP1 domain has also been used to revise the sequence determinants of TSP1 domains and derive improved Pfam sequence profiles for identification of novel TSP1 domains in more than 10,000 proteins across diverse phyla.\\n\\nSynopsisThe first structure of a thrombospondin module 1 domain (TSP1) from a CCN family matricellular protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure shows a typical three-stranded fold, but with an incomplete pi-stacked structure that is usually found in these domains. The structure reveals highest conservation in the positively charged central segment, which we predict to be a binding site for heparan sulphates.

    "abstract": "Infants of HIV positive mothers can acquire HIV infection by various routes, but even in the absence of antiviral treatment, the majority of these infants do not become infected. There is evidence that maternal antibodies may provide some protection from infection, but gestational maternal antibodies have not yet been characterized in detail. One of the most studied vertically-infected infants is BG505, as the virus from this infant yielded an Envelope protein that was successfully developed as a stable trimer. Here, we isolated and characterized 39 HIV-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) from MG505, the mother of BG505, at a time point just prior to vertical transmission. These nAbs belonged to 21 clonal families, employed a variety of VH genes, many were specific for the HIV-1 Env V3 loop, and this V3 specificity correlated with measurable antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. The isolated nAbs did not recapitulate the full breadth of heterologous nor autologous virus neutralization by contemporaneous plasma. Notably, we found that the V3-targeting nAb families neutralized one particular maternal Env variant even though all tested variants had low V3 sequence diversity and were measurably bound by these nAbs. None of the nAbs neutralized the BG505 transmitted virus. Furthermore, the MG505 nAb families were found at relatively low frequencies within the maternal B cell repertoire: all less than 0.25% of total IgG sequences. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of HIV-1 nAbs that exist within a single mother, resulting in a collection of antibody specificities that can shape the transmission bottleneck.\\n\\nImportanceMother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1 offers a unique setting in which maternal antibodies both within the mother and passively-transferred to the infant are present at the time of viral exposure. Untreated HIV-exposed human infants are infected at a rate of 30-40%, meaning that some infants do not get infected despite continued exposure to virus. Since the potential of HIV-specific immune responses to provide protection against HIV is a central goal of HIV vaccine design, understanding the nature of maternal antibodies may provide insights into immune mechanisms of protection. In this study, we isolated and characterized HIV-specific antibodies from the mother of an infant whose transmitted virus has been well studied.",

These processes have been correlated to the poor outcome of different types of neoplasias as well as drug resistance development. Since EMT/MET are transitional processes, we have generated and validated a reporter cell line. Specifically, a far-red fluorescent protein was knocked-in in-frame with the mesenchymal gene marker VIMENTIN (VIM) in H2170 lung cancer cells. The vimentin reporter cells (VRCs) are a reliable model for studying EMT and MET showing cellular plasticity upon a series of stimulations. These cells are a robust platform to dissect the molecular mechanisms of these processes, and for drug discovery in vitro and in the future in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The first lineage specification of pluripotent mouse epiblast segregates neuroectoderm (NE) from mesoderm and endoderm (ME) by currently poorly understood mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the induction of any ME-gene programs critically relies on the T-box (Tbx) transcription factors Eomes and Brachyury that concomitantly repress pluripotency and NE gene programs. Tbx-deficient cells retain pluripotency and differentiate to NE lineages despite the presence of ME-inducing signals TGF{beta}/Nodal and WNT. Pluripotency and NE gene networks are additionally repressed by Tbx-induced ME factors, demonstrating a remarkable redundancy in program regulation to safeguard mutually exclusive lineage specification. Chromatin analyses revealed that accessibility of ME-gene enhancers depends on Tbx-binding, while NE-gene enhancers are accessible and activation-primed already at pluripotency state. This asymmetry of chromatin landscape thus explains the default differentiation of pluripotent cells to NE in the absence of ME-induction mediated through the activating and repressive functions of early Tbx factors Eomes and Brachyury.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol is a widely used drug, excessive consumption of which could lead to medical conditions with diverse symptoms. Ethanol abuse causes disinhibition of memory, attention, speech and locomotion across species. Dopamine signaling plays an essential role in ethanol dependent behaviors in animals ranging from C. elegans to humans. We devised an ethanol dependent assay in which mutants in the dopamine autoreceptor, dop-2, displayed a unique sedative locomotory behavior causing the animals to move in circles while dragging the posterior half of their body. We identify the posterior dopaminergic sensory neuron as being essential to modulate this behavior. We further demonstrate that in dop-2 mutants, ethanol exposure increases dopamine secretion and results in enhanced function of the DVA interneuron. DVA releases the neuropeptide NLP-12 and leads to the excitation of cholinergic motor neurons that affect movement. Thus, DOP-2 modulates dopamine levels at the synapse and regulates alcohol induced movement through NLP-12.",

    "abstract": "The question of how animals and humans can solve arbitrary problems and achieve arbitrary goals remains open. Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods have addressed these problems, but they generally lack the ability to flexibly reassign reward value to various states as the reward structure of the environment changes. Research on cognitive control has generally focused on inhibition, rule-guided behavior, and performance monitoring, with relatively less focus on goal representations. From the engineering literature, control theory suggests a solution in that an animal can be seen as trying to minimize the difference between the actual and desired states of the world, and the Dijkstra algorithm further suggests a conceptual framework for moving a system toward a goal state. He we present a purely localist neural network model that can autonomously learn the structure of an environment and then achieve any arbitrary goal state in a changing environment without re-learning reward values. The model clarifies a number of issues inherent in biological constraints on such a system, including the essential role of oscillations in learning and performance. We demonstrate that the model can efficiently learn to solve arbitrary problems, including for example the Tower of Hanoi problem.",

As PI3K is one of the most mutated pathways in cancer, we investigated the importance of oncogenic PI3K in this process. We analyzed tumor cell organization in ascites from carcinomas at diagnosis. In some malignant ascites, tumor cells grew as adhesive coherent masses. Ex-vivo patient-derived cell cultures with the addition of mesenchymal stem cells, as a model of tumoral stroma, favored the compaction of tumorospheres. Ascites-derived ovarian cancer cell lines frequently harbored PIK3CA mutations coexisting with other mutations. PI3K promoted the formation and maintenance of multicellular adhesive PIK3CA-mutant spheroids, promoting cell survival. Cultures in 3D conditions as opposed to cultures in cell monolayers increased chemotherapy resistance, which was overcome by PI3K inhibition. We identified a signaling pathway of interest for the treatment of cancer cells disseminated in serous cavities, limiting cancer progression.\n\nGraphical abstractSchematic representation of PI3K involvement in tumor cell aggregates from ascites. 1) Known involvement of PI3K in primary ovarian tumors. 2) PI3K participates in tumorosphere formation within the peritoneum (treatment with PI3K inhibitors causes a delay in the formation of clusters). 3) PI3K participates in the maintenance of tumorospheres and in resistance to conventional treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis.

    "abstract": "The origin of eukaryotes is one of evolutions most important transitions, yet it is still poorly understood. Evidence for how it occurred should be preserved in eukaryotic genomes. Based on phylogenetic trees from ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins, eukaryotes are typically depicted as branching together with or within archaea. This ribosomal affiliation is widely interpreted as evidence for an archaeal origin of eukaryotes. However, the extent to which the archaeal ancestry of genes for the cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotic cells is representative for the rest of the eukaryotic genome is unknown. Here we have clustered 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,443 bacteria and 212 archaea with 3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 eukaryotes spanning six eukaryotic supergroups to identify genes that link eukaryotes exclusively to bacteria and archaea respectively. By downsampling the bacterial sample we obtain estimates for the bacterial and archaeal proportions of genes among 150 eukaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic genomes possess a bacterial majority of genes. On average, eukaryotic genes are 56% bacterial in origin. The majority drops to 53% in eukaryotes that never possessed plastids, and increases to 61% in photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages, where the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids contributed additional genes to the eukaryotic genome, reaching 67% in higher plants. Intracellular parasites, which undergo reductive evolution in adaptation to the nutrient rich environment of the cells that they infect, relinquish bacterial genes for metabolic processes. In the current sample, this process of adaptive gene loss is most pronounced in the human parasite Encephalitozoon intestinalis with 86% archaeal and 14% bacterial derived genes. The most bacterial eukaryote genome sampled is rice, with 67% bacterial and 33% archaeal genes. The functional dichotomy, initially described for yeast, of archaeal genes being involved in genetic information processing and bacterial genes being involved in metabolic processes is conserved across all eukaryotic supergroups.",

Here, we applied a modelling analysis to investigate the regulation divergence among a large-scale cohort of AD patients. We found that transcription regulation tended to get degenerated in AD patients, which contributed to disease development and the detrimental clinical outcomes, mainly by disrupting protein degradation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial and synaptic functions. To measure the accumulated effects, we came up with a new concept, regulation loss burden, which better correlated with AD related clinical manifestations and the ageing process. The epigenetic studies to multiple active regulation marks also supported a tendency of regulation loss in AD patients. Our finding can lead to a unified model as AD causal mechanism, where AD and its diversity are contributed by accumulated degeneration of transcriptional regulation.\\n\\nThe significance of this study is that: (1) it is the first system biology investigation to transcription regulation divergence among AD patients; (2) we observed an accumulated degeneration of transcription regulation, which well correlates with detrimental clinical outcomes; (3) transcriptional degeneration also contributes to the ageing process, where its correlation with ages is up to 0.78.",

However, the current variety of small yellow croaker that is cultivated is not capable to coping with large fluctuations in temperature.

Here, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of the liver of small yellow croaker under heat and cold stress.

Sixteen of the differentially expressed unigenes were validated by qRT-PCR. Pathway enrichment analysis identified that the ER pathway, immune signaling pathway and metabolic response pathway were affected by temperature stress. The results of this study provide a comprehensive overview of temperature stress-induced transcriptional patterns in liver tissues of the small yellow croaker. In addition, these results can guide future molecular studies of heat and cold stress response in this species for improving the stock used for aquaculture.",

We performed experimental evolution from standing genetic variation with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, measuring individual locomotion in outcrossing populations for 240 generations. We find that, in our constant environment, locomotion bias shows no directional divergence, due to both stabilizing and disruptive selection on specific combinations of component traits. Despite phenotypic stasis, the genetic variance-covariance structure between component traits shows clear divergence from the ancestral state and extensive differentiation among replicated populations facing the same environment. Analysis of mutation accumulation experiments and genome-sequenced recombinant inbred lines from the experimental populations indicates that the evolution of the genetic variance-covariance structure is independent of de novo mutation or major effect QTL; being instead explained by the joint action of selection and drift in generating subtle linkage disequilibrium differences between small effect QTL among replicate populations. These findings indicate that phenotypic evolution is repeatable because of selection, even if the genetic structuring of component traits within lineages is mostly contingent upon drift history.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Susceptibility to AD is considerably determined by genetic factors which hitherto were primarily identified using case-control designs. Elucidating the genetic architecture of additional AD-related phenotypic traits, ideally those linked to the underlying disease process, holds great promise in gaining deeper insights into the genetic basis of AD and in developing better clinical prediction models. To this end, we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data in 931 participants of the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimers Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) sample to search for novel genetic determinants of AD biomarker variability. Specifically, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses on 16 traits, including 14 measures of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau-protein species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to confirming the well-established effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) on diagnostic outcome and phenotypes related to A{beta}42, we detected novel potential signals in the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) for CSF-A{beta}38 and CSF-A{beta}40 levels, and confirmed the previously described sex-specific association between SNPs in geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and CSF-tau. Utilizing the results from independent case-control AD GWAS to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) revealed that AD risk variants only explain a small fraction of CSF biomarker variability. In conclusion, our study represents a detailed first account of GWAS analyses on CSF-A{beta} and -tau related traits in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset. In subsequent work, we will utilize the genomics data generated here in GWAS of other AD-relevant clinical outcomes ascertained in this unique dataset.",

    "abstract": "Sequence capture followed by next-generation sequencing has broad applications in cost-effective exploration of biological processes at high resolution [1, 2]. Genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) over a time course can reveal the dynamics of differential gene expression. However, in many cases, only a limited set of genes are of interest, and are repeatedly used as markers for certain biological processes. Sequence capture can help generate high-resolution quantitative datasets to assess changes in abundance of selected genes. We previously used sequence capture to accelerate Resistance gene cloning [1, 3, 4], investigate immune receptor gene diversity [5] and investigate pathogen diversity and evolution [6, 7].\\n\\nThe plant immune system involves detection of pathogens via both cell-surface and intracellular receptors. Both receptor classes can induce transcriptional reprogramming that elevates disease resistance [8]. To assess differential gene expression during plant immunity, we developed and deployed quantitative sequence capture (CAP-I). We designed and synthesized biotinylated single-strand RNA bait libraries targeted to a subset of defense genes, and generated sequence capture data from 99 RNA-seq libraries. We built a data processing pipeline to quantify the RNA-CAP-I-seq data, and visualize differential gene expression. Sequence capture in combination with quantitative RNA-seq enabled cost-effective assessment of the expression profile of a specified subset of genes. Quantitative sequence capture is not limited to RNA-seq or any specific organism and can potentially be incorporated into automated platforms for high-throughput sequencing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNEAT1 is a highly and ubiquitously expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which serves as an important regulator of cellular stress response. However, the physiological role of NEAT1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is still poorly understood. In the current study, we addressed this by characterising the CNS function in the Neat1 knockout mouse model (Neat1-/- mice), using a combination of behavioural phenotyping, electrophysiology and expression analysis. RNAscope(R) in situ hybridisation revealed that in wild-type mice, Neat1 is expressed evenly across the CNS, with high expression in glial cells and low expression in neurons. Loss of Neat1 in mice results in an inadequate reaction to physiological stress manifested as hyperlocomotion and panic escape response. In addition, Neat1-/- mice display deficits in social interaction and rhythmic patterns of activity but retain normal motor function and memory. Neat1-/- mice do not present with neuronal loss, overt neuroinflammation or gross synaptic dysfunction in the brain. However, cultured Neat1-/- neurons are characterised by hyperexcitability and dysregulated calcium homeostasis, and stress-induced neuronal activity is also augmented in Neat1-/- mice in vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that Neat1 may act as a weak positive regulator of multiple genes in the brain. Furthermore, loss of Neat1 affects alternative splicing of genes important for the CNS function and implicated in neurological diseases. Overall, our data suggest that Neat1 is involved in stress signaling in the brain and fine-tunes the CNS functions to enable adaptive behaviour in response to physiological stress.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous populations of neural progenitors in the embryonic lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) generate all GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) found in the striatum. Here we investigate how this diversity in neural progenitors relates to diversity of adult striatal neurons and circuits. Using a combination of in utero electroporation to fluorescently pulse-label striatal neural progenitors in the LGE, brain slice electrophysiology, electrical and optogenetic circuit mapping and immunohistochemistry, we characterise a population of neural progenitors enriched for apical intermediate progenitors (aIPs) and a distinct population of other progenitors (OPs) and their neural offspring. We find that neural progenitor origin has subtle but significant effects on the properties of striatal SPNs. Although aIP and OP progenitors can both generate D1-expressing direct pathway as well as D2-expressing indirect pathway SPNs found intermingled in the striatum, the aIP derived SPNs are found in more medial aspects of the striatum, exhibit more complex dendritic arbors with higher spine density and differentially sample cortical input. Moreover, optogenetic circuit mapping of the aIP derived neurons show that they further integrate within striatal circuits and innervate both local D1 and D2 SPNs. These results show that it is possible to fluorescently pulse-label distinct neural progenitor pools within the LGE and provide the first evidence that neural progenitor heterogeneity can contribute to the diversity of striatal SPNs.",

    "abstract": "Biological intracellular transport is predominantly heterogeneous in both time and space, exhibiting varying non-Brownian behaviour. Characterisation of this movement through averaging methods over an ensemble of trajectories or over the course of a single trajectory often fails to capture this heterogeneity adequately. Here, we have developed a deep learning feedforward neural network trained on fractional Brownian motion, which provides a novel, accurate and efficient characterization method for resolving heterogeneous behaviour of intracellular transport both in space and time. Importantly, the neural network requires significantly fewer data points compared to established methods, such as mean square displacements, rescaled range analysis and sequential range analysis. This enables robust estimation of Hurst exponents for very short time series data, making possible direct, dynamic segmentation and analysis of experimental tracks of rapidly moving cellular structures such as endosomes and lysosomes. By using this analysis, we were able to interpret anomalous intracellular dynamics as fractional Brownian motion with a stochastic Hurst exponent.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and a leading cause of serious infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis, compromised immune systems, and severe burns. During infection, P. aeruginosa adhesion to host epithelial cells is enhanced by surface exposed translation elongation factor EF-Tu carrying a Lys5 trimethylation. This modification is incorporated by the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase EftM. Thus, EF-Tu modification by EftM may represent a novel target to restrict the establishment of P. aeruginosa infections in vulnerable individuals. Here, we extend our understanding of EftM action by defining the molecular mechanism of EF-Tu substrate recognition by this enzyme. First, following the observation that EftM can bind to EF-Tu lacking an N-terminal peptide (encompassing the Lys5 target site), an EftM homology model was generated and used in protein-protein docking studies to predict EftM:EF-Tu interactions. The predicted protein-protein interface was then experimentally validated using site-directed mutagenesis of residues in both proteins coupled with binding and methyltransferase activity assays. We also show that EftM is unable to methylate the isolated N-terminal EF-Tu peptide and that binding-induced conformational changes in EftM are likely needed to allow placement of the first 5-6 amino acids of EF-Tu into the conserved peptide binding channel. In this channel, a group of residues that are highly conserved in EftM family proteins position the N-terminal sequence to facilitate modification of Lys5. Our findings provide detailed insights into substrate recognition by this lysine methyltransferase, paving the way for a deeper understanding of EftMs mechanism of action on EF-Tu.",

In tetrapods, adjacent somite halves recombine to form a single vertebra through the process of \\\"resegmentation\\\". However, in teleost fishes, there is considerable mixing between cells of the anterior and posterior somite halves, without clear resegmentation. To determine whether resegmentation is a tetrapod novelty, or an ancestral feature of jawed vertebrates, we tested the relationship between somites and vertebrae in a cartilaginous fish, the skate (Leucoraja erinacea). Using cell lineage tracing, we show that skate trunk vertebrae arise through tetrapod-like resegmentation, with anterior and posterior halves of each vertebra deriving from adjacent somites. We further show that tail vertebrae also arise through resegmentation, despite a duplication of the number of vertebrae per body segment. These findings resolve axial resegmentation as an ancestral feature of the jawed vertebrate body plan.",

    "abstract": "Auditory distance perception and its neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood, mainly because 1) it is difficult to separate distance processing from intensity processing, 2) multiple intensity-independent distance cues are often available, and 3) the cues are combined in a context-dependent way. A recent fMRI study identified human auditory cortical area representing intensity-independent distance for sources presented along the interaural axis (Kopco et al., PNAS, 109, 11019-11024). For these sources, two intensity-independent cues are available, interaural level difference (ILD) and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR). Thus, the observed activations may have been contributed by not only distance-related, but also direction-encoding neuron populations sensitive to ILD. Here, the paradigm from the previous study was used to examine DRR-based distance representation for sounds originating in front of the listener, where ILD is not available. In a virtual environment, we performed behavioral and fMRI experiments, combined with computational analyses to identify the neural representation of distance based on DRR. The stimuli varied in distance (15-100 cm) while their received intensity was varied randomly and independently of distance. Behavioral performance showed that intensity-independent distance discrimination is accurate for frontal stimuli, even though it is worse than for lateral stimuli. fMRI activations for sounds varying in frontal distance, as compared to varying only in intensity, increased bilaterally in the posterior banks of Heschl's gyri, the planum temporale, and posterior superior temporal gyrus regions. Taken together, these results suggest that posterior human auditory cortex areas contain neuron populations that are sensitive to distance independent of intensity and of binaural cues relevant for directional hearing.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIPosterior auditory cortices (AC) are sensitive to frontally presented distance cues\\nC_LIO_LIThese effects are independent of intensity- and direction-related binaural cues\\nC_LIO_LIfMRI activations to frontal distance cues are found in the right and left AC\\nC_LIO_LIThe frontal reverberation-related auditory distance cues are behaviorally relevant\\nC_LI",

How the emerging plant balances two co-evolved genomes is still a matter of ongoing research. Here, we focus on satellite DNA (satDNA), the fastest turn-over sequence class in eukaryotes, aiming to trace its emergence, amplification and loss during plant speciation and allopolyploidisation. As a model, we used Chenopodium quinoa Willd. (quinoa), an allopolyploid crop with 2n=4x=36 chromosomes. Quinoa originated by hybridisation of an unknown female American Chenopodium diploid (AA genome) with an unknown male Old World diploid species (BB genome), dating back 3.3 to 6.3 million years. Applying short read clustering to quinoa (AABB), C. pallidicaule (AA), and C. suecicum (BB) whole genome shotgun sequences, we classified their repetitive fractions, and identified and characterised seven satDNA families, together with the 5S rDNA model repeat. We show unequal satDNA amplification (two families) and exclusive occurrence (four families) in the AA and BB diploids by read mapping as well as Southern, genomic and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. As C. pallidicaule harbours a unique satDNA profile, we are able to exclude it as quinoas parental species. Using quinoa long reads and scaffolds, we detected only limited evidence of interlocus homogenisation of satDNA after allopolyploidisation, but were able to exclude dispersal of 5S rRNA genes between subgenomes. Our results exemplify the complex route of tandem repeat evolution through Chenopodium speciation and allopolyploidisation, and may provide sequence targets for the identification of quinoas progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Terpenes, a group of structurally diverse compounds, are the biggest class of secondary metabolites. While the biosynthesis of terpenes by enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPSs) has been described in plants and microorganisms, few TPSs have been identified in insects, despite the presence of terpenes in multiple insect species. Indeed, in many insect species, it remains unclear whether terpenes are sequestered from plants or biosynthesised de novo. No homologs of plant TPSs have been found in insect genomes, though insect TPSs with an independent evolutionary origin have been found in Hemiptera and Coleoptera. In the butterfly Heliconius melpomene, the monoterpene (E)-{beta}-ocimene acts as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone, where it is transferred during mating from males to females to avoid re-mating by deterring males. To date only one insect monoterpene synthase has been described, in Ips pini (Coleoptera), and is a multifunctional TPS and isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (IDS). Here, we combine linkage mapping and expression studies to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of (E)-{beta}-ocimene. We confirm that H. melpomene has two enzymes that exhibit TPS activity, and one of these, HMEL037106g1 is able to synthesise (E)-{beta}-ocimene in vitro. Unlike the enzyme in Ips pini, these enzymes only exhibit residual IDS activity, suggesting they are more specialised TPSs, akin to those found in plants. Phylogenetic analysis shows that these enzymes are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs. The distinct evolutionary origin of TPSs in Lepidoptera suggests that they have evolved multiple times in insects.\\n\\nSignificance statementTerpenes are a diverse class of natural compounds, used by both plants and animals for a variety of functions, including chemical communication. In insects it is often unclear whether they are synthesised de novo or sequestered from plants. Some plants and insects have converged to use the same compounds. For instance, (E)-{beta}-ocimene is a common component of floral scent and is also used by the butterfly Heliconius melpomene as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. We describe two novel terpene synthases, one of which synthesises (E)-{beta}-ocimene in H. melpomene, unrelated not only to plant enzymes but also other recently identified insect terpene synthases. This provides the first evidence that the ability to synthesise terpenes has arisen multiple times independently within the insects.",

Besides the presence of recalcitrant polymers, the presence of compounds with antimicrobial properties is known to be important to explain wood durability. Based on the advancement in our understanding of fungal detoxification systems, a reverse chemical ecology approach was proposed to explore wood natural durability. A set of six glutathione transferases from the white-rot Trametes versicolor was used as targets to test wood extracts from seventeen French Guiana neotropical species. Fluorescent thermal shift assays allowed to quantify interactions between fungal glutathione transferases and these extracts. From these data, a model combining this approach and wood density predicts significantly wood natural durability of the tested species previously estimated by long-term soil bed tests. Overall, our findings confirm that detoxification systems could be used to explore the chemical environment encountered by wood decaying fungi and then wood natural durability.",

    "abstract": "At the end of mitosis, eukaryotic cells must segregate both copies of their replicated genome into two new nuclear compartments (1). They do this either by first dismantling and later reassembling the nuclear envelope in a so called \\\"open mitosis\\\", or by reshaping an intact nucleus and then dividing into two in a \\\"closed mitosis\\\" (2, 3). However, while mitosis has been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotes for over a century (4), it is not known how the double membrane of the nuclear envelope is split into two at the end of a closed mitosis without compromising the impermeability of the nuclear compartment (5). In studying this problem in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a classical model for closed mitosis (5), we use genetics, live cell imaging and electron tomography to show that nuclear fission is achieved via local disassembly of the nuclear envelope (NE) within the narrow bridge that links segregating daughter nuclei. In doing so, we identify a novel inner NE-localised protein Les1 that restricts the process of local NE breakdown (local NEB) to the bridge midzone and prevents the leakage of material from daughter nuclei. The mechanics of local NEB in a closed mitosis closely mirror those of NEB in open mitosis (3), revealing an unexpectedly deep conservation of nuclear remodelling mechanisms across diverse eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Propagation of neural activity in spatially structured neuronal networks has been observed in awake, anesthetized and sleeping brains. However, it remains unclear how traveling waves are coordinated temporally across recurrently connected brain structures, and how network connectivity affects spatiotemporal neural activity. Here we develop a computational model of a two-dimensional thalamocortical network that enables us to investigate traveling wave characteristics in space-time. We show that thalamocortical and intracortical network connectivity, excitation/inhibition balance, thalamocortical/corticothalamic delay can independently or jointly change the spatiotemporal patterns (radial, planar and rotating waves) and characteristics (speed, direction and frequency) of cortical and thalamic traveling waves. Simulations of our model further predict that increased thalamic inhibition induces slower cortical wave frequency, and enhanced cortical excitation increases cortical wave speed and oscillation frequencies. Overall, the model study provides not only theoretical insight into the basis for spatiotemporal wave patterns, but also experimental predictions that potentially control these dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCognition or sensorimotor control requires the coordination of neural activity across widespread brain circuits. Propagating waves of oscillatory neural activities have been observed at both macroscopic and mesoscopic levels, with various frequencies, spatial coverage, and modalities. However, a complete understanding how thalamocortical traveling waves are originated and temporally coordinated in the thalamus and cortex are still unclear. Furthermore, it remains unknown how the network connectivity, excitation/inhibition balance, thalamocortical or corticothalamic delay determine the spatiotemporal wave patterns and characteristics of cortical and thalamic traveling waves. Here we develop a computational model of a two-dimensional thalamocortical network to investigate the thalamic and neocortical traveling wave characteristics in space-time, which allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of thalamocortical network properties on the formation and maintenance of complex traveling wave patterns. Our computational model provides strong theoretical insight into the basis of spatiotemporal wave propagation, as well as experimental predictions that control these wave dynamics.",

To test this possibility, we administered probiotic Lactococcus lactis in the drinking water to mouse dams from day 10.5 of gestation and until pups reached postnatal day 1 (P1). Pups were assessed in a battery of behavioral tests starting at 10 weeks old. We found that females, but not males, exposed to probiotic during prenatal development spent more time in the center of the open field and also displayed decreased freezing time in cue associated learning, compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that probiotic exposure changes the densities of cortical neurons and increases the density of blood vessels in the cortical plate of P1 pups. Sex-specific differences were observed in the numbers of mitotic neural progenitor cells, which were increased in probiotic exposed female pups. In addition, we found that probiotics treatment throughout pregnancy significantly increased plasma oxytocin levels in mouse dams, but not in the offspring. These results suggest that exposure of naive, unstressed dams to probiotic may exert sex-specific long-term effects on cortical development and anxiety related behavior in the offspring.",

    "abstract": "The population dynamics of human-to-mosquito malaria transmission in the field has important implications for the genetics, epidemiology and control of malaria. The number of oocysts in oocysts positive mosquitoes developing from a single, naturally acquired infectious blood meal (herein referred to as parasite exposure) greatly influence the effectiveness of transmission blocking interventions but still remains poorly documented. During a year-long analysis of malaria parasite transmission in Burkina Faso we caught and dissected wild malaria vectors to assess Plasmodium oocysts prevalence and load (the number of oocysts counted in mosquitoes with detectable oocysts) and the prevalence of salivary gland sporozoites. This was compared to malaria endemicity in the human population assessed in cross-sectional surveys. Data was analyzed using a novel transmission mathematical model to estimate the per-bite transmission probability and the average parasite exposure of mosquitoes for each location. Observed oocysts load and estimated parasite exposure in naturally infected mosquitoes is substantially higher than previous estimates (ranging from 3.2 to 24.5 according to seasons and locations) and indicates a strong positive association between parasite exposure of mosquitoes and parasite prevalence in human. This work suggests that highly infected mosquitoes may have a greater influence on the epidemiology and genetics of the parasite and that novel partially effective transmission blocking interventions may become more effective at halting transmission as parasite exposure is diminished.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders arise from combined defects in processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and commissure formation. The evolutionarily conserved tumor-suppressor protein Scribble (Scrib) serves as a nexus to transduce signals for the establishment of apicobasal and planar cell polarity during these processes. Human SCRIB gene mutations are associated with neural tube defects and this gene is located in the minimal critical region deleted in the rare Verheij syndrome. In this study, we generated brain-specific conditional cKO mouse mutants and assessed the impact of the Scrib deletion on brain morphogenesis and behavior. We showed that embryonic deletion of Scrib in the telencephalon leads to cortical thickness reduction (microcephaly) and alteration of interhemispheric connectivity (corpus callosum and hippocampal commissure agenesis). We correlated these phenotypes with the identification of novel roles for Scrib, both cell- and non-cell-autonomous, on neuronal migration and axonal guidance respectively. Finally, we show that Scrib cKO mice have psychomotor deficits such as locomotor activity impairment and memory alterations. Altogether, we show that Scrib is essential for early brain development and that the outcomes of its brain-specific disruption support a direct or indirect participation of Scrib to neurodevelopmental pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Tools that predict the functional importance of genetic variation almost always rely on sequence conservation across deep evolutionary divergences as a primary discriminator. However, sequence conservation information is misleading when predicting the functional importance of pharmacogenetic variants related to off-target adverse drug reactions. Sequence conservation is largely maintained by evolutionary purifying selection, which has not been relevant for most drugs until very recently, especially for off-target effects. Here, we use a simple classification criteria to identify variants with off-target pharmacogenetic effects from the PharmGKB database. We show that off-target pharmacogenetic variation is predicted mostly to be benign by all state-of-the-art prediction tools we tested. Hence, off-target pharmacogenetic variants are overwhelmingly invisible to all predictive methodologies currently employed. Very different analytical approaches will be needed to address this important problem.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen a personal genome sequence is obtained for a given person, the sequence is compared to the human reference sequence to identify where it differs from the genome of that person. One application of this information is that it may identify how a specific person may react to particular drugs. However, when computationally predicting the functional importance of a genetic variant, the tools used rely heavily on sequence conservation information to make their prediction. From an evolutionary point of view, the use of drugs to treat diseases is a very recent activity - and one that has not had time to cause certain variants to either be selected for or removed from the population. This produces a blind-spot for tools that predict variant functional effects, especially for drugs with off-target interactions that may produce unanticipated effects.",

    "abstract": "The elemental composition of organisms relates to a suite of functional traits that change during development in response to environmental conditions. It may be a part of a phenomenon known as  developmental programming, which hypothetically creates phenotypes that are better adapted to their environments. However, associations between developmental speed and elemental body composition are not well understood. We compared body mass, elemental body composition, food uptake and fat metabolism of Drosophila melanogaster Oregon-R male fruit flies across the time gradient of their larval development. The results showed that flies with intermediate and rapid developmental speeds were heavier than slowly developing flies. Slowly developing flies had higher body carbon concentration than rapidly developing and intermediate flies. Rapidly developing flies had the highest body nitrogen concentration, while slowly developing flies had higher body nitrogen levels than flies with intermediate speed of development. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio was therefore lower in rapidly developing flies than in slow and intermediate flies. Feeding rates were lowest in the slowly developing flies. The amount of storage fats was highest in the intermediate group. This means that the growth of rapidly developing flies is not suppressed by stress and they actively convert the food they consume into growth with less emphasis on storage build-up, suggesting bet-hedging in the larval development. In contrast, flies in the intermediate developmental group had the greatest fat reserves which optimize fitness under many climatic conditions. Low food intake may slow down development and the accumulation of body fat reserves in slowly developing flies. However, at the cost of slower growth, their phenotype conceivably facilitates survival under higher stochasticity of their ephemeral environments spoiled by metabolic waste due to high density of conspecifics. Overall, this study suggests that bet-hedging may be a common developmental strategy in fruit flies to cope with environmental uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNon-typhoidal Salmonella enterica strains, including serovar Typhimurium (STm), are an emerging cause of invasive disease among children and the immunocompromised, especially in regions of sub-Saharan Africa. STm invades the intestinal mucosa through Peyers patch tissues before disseminating systemically. While vaccine development efforts are ongoing, the emergence of multidrug resistant strains of STm affirms the need to seek alternative strategies to protect high-risk individuals from infection.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn this report we investigated the potential of an orally administered O5 serotype-specific IgA monoclonal antibody (mAb), called Sal4, to protect mice against invasive Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection. Sal4 IgA was delivered to mice prior to or concurrently with STm challenge. Infectivity was measured as bacterial burden in Peyers patch tissues one day after challenge. Using this model, we defined the minimal amount of Sal4 IgA required to significantly reduce STm uptake into Peyers patches. The relative efficacy of Sal4 in dimeric and secretory IgA (SIgA) forms was compared, as was a second lower avidity O5-specific IgA mAb that we produced from STm immunized mice. To assess the role of isotype in oral passive immunization, we engineered a recombinant IgG1 mAb carrying the Sal4 variable regions and evaluated its ability to block invasion of STm into epithelial cells in vitro and Peyers patch tissues.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results demonstrate the potential of orally administered monoclonal IgA and SIgA, but not IgG, to passively immunize against invasive Salmonella. Nonethless, the prophylactic window of IgA/SIgA in the mouse was on the order of minutes, underscoring the need to develop formulations to protect mAbs in the gastric environment and to permit sustained release in the small intestine.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe bacterium Salmonella enterica is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing worlds. While the pathogen is most renowed as the causative agent of typhoid fever, the emergence of invasive non-typhoid strains like S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) are of great concern because of their propensity to cause severe disease in children under the age of five. In this report, we demonstrate in a mouse model that oral administration of a monoclonal antibody targeting the surface of STm is able to prevent the bacterium from infecting gastrointestinal tissues, the first step in the dissemination process. We show that IgA antibodies (which are normally found in the gut) were far superior than an equivalent IgG antibody (normally found in blood) at protecting the intestine from STm infection. These results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at the development of an orally administered antibody cocktail capable of providing temporary immunity to pathogens like S. enterica.",

However, how activity perturbation influences individual synapses, the network response and the underlying signalling mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we exploit a recently identified critical period in the development of the Drosophila larval locomotor circuit to show that activity perturbation differentially affects individual and identified synaptic pairings. Remarkably, we further show that activity-manipulation of a selective excitatory interneuron is sufficient to fully recapitulate the effects induced by network-wide activity disturbance; indicative that some neurons make a greater contribution to network tuning. We identify nitric oxide (NO)-signalling as a potential mediator of activity-dependent network tuning during the critical period. Significantly, the effect of NO-signalling to network tuning is dictated by the prior activity state of the network. Thus, this study provides mechanistic insight that is currently lacking into how activity during a critical period tunes a developing network.",

The characteristics of APS in pregnancy include vascular thrombosis, inflammation and impairment of trophoblast implantation. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has been suggested as one of the genetic factors that contribute to the development of this syndrome. miRNAs regulate gene expressions in a vast assortment of cellular biological mechanisms include the development of placental tissue. Hence, further investigation on the regulation of placental miRNA in APS is required. In this study, we aimed to profile miRNA expressions from placenta tissue of patients with APS. Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined for its targeted genes and pathways. Agilent microarray platform was used to measure placental microRNA expressions between normal placental tissue and those obtained from patients with APS. Differentially expressed miRNAs were detected using GeneSpring GX software 14.2 and sequences were mapped using TargetScan software to generate the predicted target genes. Pathway analysis for the genes was then performed on PANTHER and REACTOME software. Selected miRNAs and their associated genes of interest were validated using qPCR. Microarray findings revealed, 9 downregulated and 21 upregulated miRNAs expressed in placenta of patients with APS. Quantitative expressions of 3 selected miRNAs were in agreement with the microarray findings, however only miR-525-5p expression was statistically significant. Pathway analysis revealed that the targeted genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in several hypothesized signalling pathways such as the vascular endothelial (VE) growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory pathways. VE-cadherin, ras homolog member A (RHOA) and tyrosine kinase receptor (KIT) showed significant downregulation from the qPCR data while retinoblastoma gene (RET), dual specificity protein phosphatase 10 (DUSP10) and B-lymphocyte kinase (BLK) were significantly upregulated. These preliminary findings suggest the involvement of miRNAs and identified novel associated genes involvement in the mechanism of obstetric APS, particularly through the alteration of vascular-associated regulators and the inflammatory signalling cascade.",

    "abstract": "Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that results in a variety of systemic and local pathologies in envenomed victims and is responsible for around 138,000 deaths every year. Many snake venoms cause severe coagulopathy that makes victims vulnerable to suffering life-threating haemorrhage. The mechanisms of action of coagulopathic snake venom toxins are diverse and can result in both anticoagulant and procoagulant effects. However, because snake venoms consist of a mixture of numerous protein and peptide components, high throughput characterizations of specific target bioactives is challenging. In this study, we applied a combination of analytical and pharmacological methods to identify snake venom toxins from a wide diversity of snake species that perturb coagulation. To do so, we used a high-throughput screening approach consisting of a miniaturised plasma coagulation assay in combination with a venom nanofractionation approach. Twenty snake venoms were first separated using reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and a post-column split allowed a small fraction to be analyzed with mass spectrometry, while the larger fraction was collected and dispensed onto 384-well plates before direct analysis using a plasma coagulation assay. Our results demonstrate that many snake venoms simultaneously contain both procoagulant and anticoagulant bioactives that contribute to coagulopathy. In-depth identification analysis from seven medically-important venoms, via mass spectrometry and nanoLC-MS/MS, revealed that phospholipase A2 toxins are frequently identified in anticoagulant venom fractions, while serine protease and metalloproteinase toxins are often associated with procoagulant bioactivities. The nanofractionation and proteomics approach applied herein seems likely to be a valuable tool for the rational development of next-generation snakebite treatments by facilitating the rapid identification and fractionation of coagulopathic toxins, thereby enabling specific targeting of these toxins by new therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors.\\n\\nAuthor summarySnakebite is a neglected tropical disease that results in more than 100,000 deaths every year. Haemotoxicity is one of the most common signs of systemic envenoming observed after snakebite, and many snake venoms cause severe impairment of the blood coagulation that makes victims vulnerable to suffering life-threating hemorrhage. In this study, we applied a combination of analytical and pharmacological methods to identify snake venom toxins from a wide diversity of snake species that interfere with blood coagulation. Twenty snake venoms were screened for their effects on the blood coagulation cascade and based on the initial results and the medical relevance of the species, seven venoms were selected for in-depth analysis of the responsible toxins using advanced identification techniques. Our findings reveal a number of anticoagulant toxins that have not yet been reported before as such. The methodology described herein not only enables the identification of both known and unknown toxins that cause impairment of the blood coagulation, but offers a throughput platform to effectively screen for inhibitory molecules relevant for the development of next generation snakebite treatments.",

    "abstract": "Information on the buoyancy of eggs and larvae from deep-sea species is rare but necessary for explaining the position of non-swimming larvae in the water column. Due to embryonic morphology and ecology diversities, egg buoyancy has important variations within one species and among other ones. Nevertheless, it has hardly been explored if this buoyancy variability can be a strategy for deep-sea larvae to optimize their transport beyond their spawning areas. In the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, protozoea and mysis larvae of the commercial deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus were recently found in upper layers, but to present, earlier stages like eggs and nauplii have not been collected. Using a Lagrangian transport model and larval characteristics, we evaluate the buoyancy and hydrodynamic effects on the transport of A. antennatus larvae in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The transport models suggested that 75% of buoyant eggs released between 500 and 800 m depth (i.e., known spawning area), reached the upper water layers (0-75 m depth). Then, according to the modeled larval drifts, three spawning regions were defined in the studied area: 1) the northern part, along a continental margin crossed by large submarine canyons; 2) the central part, with two circular circulation structures (i.e., eddies); and 3) the southern part, with currents flowing through a channel. The number of larvae in the most upper layer (0-5 m depth) was higher if the larval transport model accounted for the ascent of eggs and nauplii (81%) instead of eggs reaching the surface before hatching (50%). The larvae reaching the most water upper layer (0-5 m depth) had higher rates of dispersal than the ones transported below the surface layer (deeper than 5 m depth). The results of larval dispersal simulations have implications for the understanding of A. antennatus larval ecology and for management decisions related to the shrimp fisheries in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear oncoprotein EBNA3C is essential for B-cell transformation and development of several B-cell lymphomas particularly those are generated in an immuno-compromised background. EBNA3C recruits ubiquitin-proteasome machinery for deregulating multiple cellular oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins. Although EBNA3C is found to be ubiquitinated at its N-terminal region and interacts with 20S proteasome, the viral protein is surprisingly stable in growing B-lymphocytes. EBNA3C can also circumvent autophagy-lysosomal mediated protein degradation and subsequent antigen presentation for T-cell recognition. Recently, we have shown that EBNA3C enhances autophagy, which serve as a prerequisite for B-cell survival particularly under growth deprivation conditions. We now demonstrate that proteasomal inhibition by MG132 induces EBNA3C degradation both in EBV transformed B-lymphocytes and ectopic-expression systems. Interestingly, MG132 treatment promotes degradation of two EBNA3 family oncoproteins - EBNA3A and EBNA3C, but not the viral tumor suppressor protein EBNA3B. EBNA3C degradation induced by proteasomal inhibition is partially blocked when autophagy-lysosomal pathway is inhibited. In response to proteasomal inhibition, EBNA3C is predominantly K63-linked polyubiquitinated, colocalized with the autophagy-lsyosomal fraction in the cytoplasm and participated within p62-LC3B complex, which facilitates autophagy-mediated degradation. We further show that the degradation signal is present at the first 50 residues of the N-terminal region of EBNA3C. Proteasomal inhibition reduces the colony formation ability of this important viral oncoprotein, increases transcriptional activation of both latent and lytic gene expression and induces viral reactivation from EBV transformed B-lymphocytes. Altogether, this study offers rationale to use proteasome inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategy against multiple EBV associated B-cell lymphomas, where EBNA3C is expressed.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes latent infection in B-lymphocytes and is associated with a number of human malignancies, both of epithelial and lymphoid origin. EBV encoded EBNA3 family of nuclear latent antigens comprising of EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C are unique to immunoblastic lymphomas. While EBNA3A and EBNA3C are involved in blocking many important tumor suppressive mechanisms, EBNA3B exhibits tumor suppressive functions. Although EBNA3 proteins, in particular EBNA3C, interact with and employ different protein degradation machineries to induce B-cell lymphomagenesis, these viral proteins are extremely stable in growing B-lymphocytes. To this end, we now demonstrate that proteasomal inhibition leads to specifically degradation of oncogenic EBNA3A and EBNA3C proteins, whereas EBNA3B remains unaffected. Upon proteasomal inhibition, EBNA3C degradation occurs via autophagy-lysosomal pathway, through labeling with K63-linked polyubiquitination and participating in p62-LC3B complex involved in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy substrate selection and degradation through autolysosomal process. We also demonstrate that the N-terminal domain is responsible for autophgy-lysosomal mediated degradation, while the C-terminal domain plays a crucial role in cytoplasmic localization. Fascinatingly, while proteasomal inhibition reduces EBNA3Cs oncogenic property, it induces both latent and lytic gene expressions and promotes viral reactivation from EBV transformed B-lymphocytes. This is the first report which demonstrates a viral oncoprotein degrades through autophagy-lysosomal pathway upon proteasomal inhibition. In sum, the results promise development of novel strategies specifically targeting proteolytic pathway for the treatment of EBV associated B-cell lymphomas, particularly those are generated in immunocompromised individuals.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the underpinnings of biological motor control is an important issue in movement neuroscience. Optimal control theory is a leading framework to rationalize this problem in computational terms. Previously, optimal control models have been devised either in deterministic or in stochastic settings to account for different aspects of motor control (e.g. average behavior versus trial-to-trial variability). While these approaches have yielded valuable insights about motor control, they typically fail explain a common phenomenon known as muscle co-contraction. Co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles contributes to modulate the mechanical impedance of the neuromusculoskeletal system (e.g. joint stiffness) and is thought to be mainly under the influence of descending signals from the brain. Here we present a theory suggesting that one primary goal of motor planning may be to issue feedforward (open-loop) motor commands that optimally specify both force and impedance, according to the noisy neuromusculoskeletal dynamics and to optimality criteria based on effort and variance. We show that the proposed framework naturally accounts for several previous experimental findings regarding the regulation of force and impedance via muscle co-contraction in the upper-limb. Optimal feedback (closedloop) control, preprogramming feedback gains but requiring on-line state estimation processes through long-latency sensory feedback loops, may then complement this nominal feedforward motor command to fully determine the limbs mechanical impedance. The stochastic optimal open-loop control theory may provide new insights about the general articulation of feedforward/feedback control mechanisms and justify the occurrence of muscle co-contraction in the neural control of movement.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThis study presents a novel computational theory to explain the planning of force and impedance (e.g. stiffness) in the neural control of movement. It assumes that one main goal of motor planning is to elaborate feedforward motor commands that determine both the force and the impedance required for the task at hand. These feedforward motor commands (i.e. that are defined prior to movement execution) are designed to minimize effort and variance costs considering the uncertainty arising from sensorimotor noise. A major outcome of this mathematical framework is the explanation of a long-known phenomenon called muscle co-contraction (i.e. the concurrent contraction of opposing muscles). Muscle co-contraction has been shown to occur in many situations but previous modeling works struggled to account for it. Although effortful, co-contraction contributes to increase the robustness of motor behavior (e.g. small variance) upstream of sophisticated optimal feedback control processes that require state estimation from delayed sensory feedback to function. This work may have implications regarding our understanding of the neural control of movement in computational terms. It also provides a theoretical ground to explain how to optimally plan force and impedance within a general and versatile framework.",

    "abstract": "Iron biofortified beans and carotenoid enriched cassava are proposed as a solution to combat iron and vitamin A deficiencies, respectively, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). To inform the need for biofortified foods we conducted a survey in 2014, in two provinces of the DRC, South Kivu and Kongo Central. Unexpectedly, women of reproductive age (WRA; 15-49 y) and their children (6-59 m) had a low prevalence of biochemical iron and vitamin A deficiency, based on ferritin and retinol binding protein, respectively. However, to better understand the lack of biochemical deficiency of these nutrients we examined the prevalence of inadequate intake for these and other select nutrients. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls (with repeats) among 744 mother-child dyads. In WRA the prevalence of inadequate iron intakes was 32% (10% bioavailability). The prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intakes was low in South Kivu (18%) and negligible in Kongo Central (1%). The prevalence of inadequate iron intake was 74% in infants (6-11 m) and ~22% in the older children (12-59 months). There was a high prevalence of inadequate zinc intake in women and children (i.e. 83% WRA) consistent with our findings of a high prevalence of low serum zinc in the same sample. Dietary data here corroborate the low prevalence of biochemical vitamin A deficiency but not iron. However, any change to the supply of red palm oil would dramatically reduce population vitamin A intakes, thus a carotenoid enriched cassava program may be beneficial as a safety net measure. Additionally, iron biofortified beans may be warranted given the high rates of dietary inadequacy and uncertainty around the validity of iron biomarkers. Crops biofortified with zinc also appear warranted. We caution that our findings cannot be extrapolated to the entire Congo where diverse agro-ecological landscape exist or when political and environmental shocks occur which challenge food production.",
