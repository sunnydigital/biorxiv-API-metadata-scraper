    "abstract": "Tumors are made of evolving and heterogeneous populations of cells which arise from successive appearance and expansion of subclonal populations, following acquisition of mutations conferring them a selective advantage. Those subclonal populations can be sensitive or resistant to different treatments, and provide information about tumor aetiology and future evolution. Hence, it is important to be able to assess the level of heterogeneity of tumors with high reliability for clinical applications.\\n\\nIn the past few years, a large number of methods have been proposed to estimate intra-tumor heterogeneity from whole exome sequencing (WES) data, but the accuracy and robustness of these methods on real data remains elusive. Here we systematically apply and compare 6 computational methods to estimate tumor heterogeneity on 1,697 WES samples from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) covering 3 cancer types (breast invasive carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), and two distinct input mutation sets. We observe significant differences between the estimates produced by different methods, and identify several likely confounding factors in heterogeneity assessment for the different methods. We further show that the prognostic value of tumor heterogeneity for survival prediction is limited in those datasets, and find no evidence that it improves over prognosis based on other clinical variables.\\n\\nIn conclusion, heterogeneity inference from WES data on a single sample, and its use in cancer prognosis, should be considered with caution. Other approaches to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity such as those based on multiple samples may be preferable for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectiveIt remains difficult to characterize pain in knee joints with osteoarthritis solely by radiographic findings. We sought to understand how advanced machine learning methods such as deep neural networks can be used to analyze raw MRI scans and predict bilateral knee pain, independent of other risk factors.\n\nMethodsWe developed a deep learning framework to associate information from MRI slices taken from the left and right knees of subjects from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with bilateral knee pain. Model training was performed by first extracting features from two-dimensional (2D) sagittal intermediate-weighted turbo spin echo slices. The extracted features from all the 2D slices were subsequently combined to directly associate using a fused deep neural network with the output of interest as a binary classification problem.\n\nResultsThe deep learning model resulted in predicting bilateral knee pain on test data with 70.1% mean accuracy, 51.3% mean sensitivity, and 81.6% mean specificity. Systematic analysis of the predictions on the test data revealed that the model performance was consistent across subjects of different Kellgren-Lawrence grades.\n\nConclusionThe study demonstrates a proof of principle that a machine learning approach can be applied to associate MR images with bilateral knee pain.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATIONKnee pain is typically considered as an early indicator of osteoarthritis (OA) risk. Emerging evidence suggests that MRI changes are linked to pre-clinical OA, thus underscoring the need for building image-based models to predict knee pain. We leveraged a state-of-the-art machine learning approach to associate raw MR images with bilateral knee pain, independent of other risk factors.",

We use a recent exact solution of spike-timing for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons under noisy inputs balanced near threshold, and construct a framework that links synaptic type/strength, and spiking nonlinearity, with statistics of neuronal activity. The framework explains structured higher-order interactions of neurons receiving common inputs under different architectures. Comparing models prediction with an empirical dataset of monkey V1 neurons, we find that excitatory inputs to pairs explain the observed sparse activity characterized by negative triple-wise interactions, ruling out the intuitive shared inhibition. We show that the strong interactions are in general the signature of excitatory rather than inhibitory inputs whenever spontaneous activity is low. Finally, we present a guide map that can be used to reveal the hidden motifs underlying observed interactions found in empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Despite their widespread applications, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments are still plagued by batch effects and dropout events. Although the completely randomized experimental design has frequently been advocated to control for batch effects, it is rarely implemented in real applications due to time and budget constraints. Here, we mathematically prove that under two more flexible and realistic experimental designs--the \"reference panel\" and the \"chain-type\" designs--true biological variability can also be separated from batch effects. We develop Batch effects correction with Unknown Subtypes for scRNA-seq data (BUSseq), which is an interpretable Bayesian hierarchical model that closely follows the data-generating mechanism of scRNA-seq experiments. BUSseq can simultaneously correct batch effects, cluster cell types, impute missing data caused by dropout events, and detect differentially expressed genes without requiring a preliminary normalization step. We demonstrate that BUSseq outperforms existing methods with simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "Pirate phages use the structural proteins encoded by unrelated helper phages to propagate. The best-studied example is the pirate P4 and helper P2 of coliphages, and it has been known that the Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) that can encode virulence factors act as pirate phages, too. When alone in the host, the pirate phages act as a prophage, but when the helper phage gene is also in the same host cell, the pirate phage has ability to exploit the helper phages structural proteins to produce pirate phage particles and spread, interfering with the helper phage production. The known helper phages in these systems are temperate phages. Interestingly, the interference of the pirate phage to the helper phage occurs in a different manner between the SaPI-helper system and the P4-P2 system. SaPIs cannot lyse a helper lysogen upon infection, while when a helper phage lyse a SaPI lysogen, most of the phage particles produced are the SaPI particles. On the contrary, in the P4-P2 system, a pirate phage P4 can lyse a helper P2 lysogen to produce mostly the P4 particles, while when P2 phage lyses a P4 lysogen, most of the produced phages are the P2 particles. Here, the consequences of these different strategies in the pirate and helper phage spreading among uninfected host is analyzed by using mathematical models. It is found that SaPIs strategy interferes with the helper phage spreading significantly more than the P4s strategy, because SaPI interferes with the helper phages main reproduction step, while P4 interferes only by forcing the helper lysogens to lyse. However, the interference is found to be weaker in the spatially structured environment than in the well-mixed environment. This is because, in the spatial setting, the system tends to self-organize so that the helper phages take over the front of propagation due to the need of helper phage for the pirate phage spreading.\n\nCompeting interestsThe author declares no competing interest.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy number profiles at the cellular level. This technology circumvents the averaging effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and increases resolution while decreasing ambiguity in tracking the evolutionary history of cancer. ScDNA-seq data is, however, highly sparse and noisy due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data of cancer cells. The main features of SCOPE include: (i) a Poisson latent factor model for normalization, which borrows information across cells and regions to estimate bias, using negative control cells identified by cell-specific Gini coefficients; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the normalization step, which accounts for the aberrant copy number changes that deviate from the null distributions; and (iii) a cross-sample segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from the same subclone. We evaluate SCOPE on a diverse set of scDNA-seq data in cancer genomics, using array-based calls of purified bulk samples as gold standards and whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing as orthogonal validations; we find that, compared to existing methods, SCOPE offers more accurate copy number estimates. Further, we demonstrate SCOPE on three recently released scDNA-seq datasets by 10X Genomics: we show that it can reliably recover 1% cancer cell spike-ins from a background of normal cells and that it successfully reconstructs cancer subclonal structure from [~]10,000 breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), a measure of the number of mitochondrial genomes per cell, is a minimally invasive proxy measure for mitochondrial function and has been associated with several aging-related diseases. Although quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the current gold standard method for measuring mtDNA-CN, mtDNA-CN can also be measured from genotyping microarray probe intensities and DNA sequencing read counts. To conduct a comprehensive examination on the performance of these methods, we use known mtDNA-CN correlates (age, sex, white blood cell count, Duffy locus genotype, incident cardiovascular disease) to evaluate mtDNA-CN calculated from qPCR, two microarray platforms, as well as whole genome (WGS) and whole exome sequence (WES) data across 1,085 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and 3,489 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We observe mtDNA-CN derived from WGS data is significantly more associated with known correlates compared to all other methods (p < 0.001). Additionally, mtDNA-CN measured from WGS is on average more significantly associated with traits by 5.6 orders of magnitude and has effect size estimates 5.8 times more extreme than the current gold standard of qPCR. We further investigated the role of DNA extraction method on mtDNA-CN estimate reproducibility and found mtDNA-CN estimated from cell lysate is significantly less variable than traditional phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (p = 5.44x10-4) and silica-based column selection (p = 2.82x10-7). In conclusion, we recommend the field moves towards more accurate methods for mtDNA-CN, as well as re-analyze trait associations as more WGS data becomes available from larger initiatives such as TOPMed.",

Due to its importance, novel methods have been developed recently for this purpose. However, different approaches generate varying estimates regarding the number of clusters and the single-cell level cluster assignments. This type of unsupervised clustering is challenging and it is often times hard to gauge which method to use because none of the existing methods outperform others across all scenarios. We present SAME-clustering, a mixture model-based approach that takes clustering solutions from multiple methods and selects a maximally diverse subset to produce an improved ensemble solution. We tested SAME-clustering across 15 scRNA-seq datasets generated by different platforms, with number of clusters varying from 3 to 15, and number of single cells from 49 to 32,695. Results show that our SAME-clustering ensemble method yields enhanced clustering, in terms of both cluster assignments and number of clusters. The mixture model ensemble clustering is not limited to clustering scRNA-seq data and may be useful to a wide range of clustering applications.",

    "abstract": "The effects of cannabis reported by users range from experiences of euphoria and anxiolytic effects to paranoia, anxiety, and increased risk of depression. Attempts to reconcile the apparent contradictions in user response have not been conclusive. Here, we utilized selectively-bred stress-resilient socially dominant (Dom) and stress-sensitive socially submissive (Sub) mice to elucidate this contradiction. Following short-term, repeated treatment with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at two different doses (1.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg), Sub mice presented significant place-aversion in a Conditioned Place Preference paradigm at a high dose, whereas Dom mice displayed no place preference or aversion. Forced Swim test conducted after 6-week of washout period, revealed differential impact of the two THC doses depending upon behavioral pattern. Specifically, the low dose alleviated depressive-like behavior in Sub mice, while the high dose produced the opposite effect in Dom mice. Interestingly, corticosterone concentration in serum was elevated at the high dose regardless of the mice-population tested. We conclude here that differences in dominance behavior and stress vulnerability are involved in the regulation of cannabis response among users and should be considered when prescribing THC-containing medications to patients.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of the interferon (IFN) system, the major innate antiviral mechanism of vertebrates, remains poorly understood. According to the detection of type I IFN genes in cartilaginous fish genomes, the system appeared 500My ago. However, the IFN system integrates many other components, most of which are encoded by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To shed light on its evolution, we have used deep RNA sequencing to generate a comprehensive list of ISGs of zebrafish, taking advantage of the high quality genome annotation in this species. We analyzed larvae after inoculation of recombinant zebrafish type I IFN, or infection with chikungunya virus, a potent IFN inducer. We identified more than 400 zebrafish ISGs, defined as being either directly induced by IFN or induced by the virus in an IFN receptor-dependent manner. Their human orthologues were highly enriched in ISGs, particularly for highly-inducible genes. We identified 72 orthology groups containing ISGs in both zebrafish and human, revealing a core ancestral ISG repertoire, which includes most of the known signaling components of the IFN system. Many downstream effectors were also already present 450 My ago in the common ancestor of tetrapods and bony fish, and diversified as multi-gene families independently in the two lineages. A large proportion of the ISG repertoire is lineage-specific; around 40% of protein-coding zebrafish ISGs had no human orthologue. We identified 14 fish-specific gene families containing multiple ISGs, including finTRIMs. This work illuminates the evolution of the IFN system and provides a rich resource to explore new antiviral mechanisms.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIWe established an exhaustive list of larval zebrafish ISGs.\\nC_LIO_LIOrthologous ISGs in fish and human identify a large ancestral ISG repertoire.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In a number of animal species, divergent natural selection has repeatedly and independently driven the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations adapted to contrasting, but not to similar environments1. This process is known as parallel ecological speciation, and examples in plants are enigmatically rare2. Here, we perform a comprehensive test of the ecological speciation hypothesis in an Australian wildflower where parapatric populations found in coastal sand dunes (Dune ecotype) and headlands (Headland ecotype) have repeatedly and independently diverged in growth habit. Consistent with a role for divergent natural selection driving the evolution of reproductive isolation, we found that Dune populations with erect growth habit were easy to transplant across sand dunes, were largely interfertile despite half-a-million years of divergence, and were reproductively isolated from equally divergent Headland populations with prostrate growth habit. However, we unexpectedly discovered that both extrinsic and intrinsic reproductive isolation has evolved between prostrate Headland populations, suggesting that populations evolving convergent phenotypes can also rapidly become new species. Mutation-order speciation2, where the random accumulation of adaptive alleles create genetic incompatibilities between populations inhabiting similar habitats, provides a compelling explanation for these complex patterns of reproductive isolation.

Using integral difference equation models, we examine how individual variation in these fundamental traits and the heritability of these traits influence rates of spatial spread of populations along a one-dimensional transect. Using a mixture of analytic and numerical methods, we show that individual variation in dispersal rates increases spread rates and the more heritable this variation, the greater the increase. In contrast, individual variation in lifetime fecundity only increases spread rates when some of this variation is heritable. The highest increases in spread rates occurs when variation in dispersal positively covaries with fecundity. Our results highlight the importance of estimating individual variation in dispersal rates, dispersal syndromes in which fecundity and dispersal co-vary positively, and heritability of these traits to predict population rates of spatial spread.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging faces the daunting challenge of multiple testing - an instance of multiplicity - that is associated with two other issues to some extent: low inference efficiency and poor reproducibility. Typically, the same statistical model is applied to each spatial unit independently in the approach of massively univariate modeling. In dealing with multiplicity, the general strategy employed in the field is the same regardless of the specifics: trust the local \\\"unbiased\\\" effect estimates while adjusting the extent of statistical evidence at the global level. However, in this approach, modeling efficiency is compromised because each spatial unit (e.g., voxel, region, matrix element) is treated as an isolated and independent entity during massively univariate modeling. In addition, the required step of multiple testing \\\"correction\\\" by taking into consideration spatial relatedness, or neighborhood leverage, can only partly recoup statistical efficiency, resulting in potentially excessive penalization as well as arbitrariness due to thresholding procedures. Moreover, the assigned statistical evidence at the global level heavily relies on the data space (whole brain or a small volume). The present paper reviews how Steins paradox (1956) motivates a Bayesian multilevel (BML) approach that, rather than fighting multiplicity, embraces it to our advantage through a global calibration process among spatial units. Global calibration is accomplished via a Gaussian distribution for the cross-region effects whose properties are not a priori specified, but a posteriori determined by the data at hand through the BML model. Our framework therefore incorporates multiplicity as integral to the modeling structure, not a separate correction step. By turning multiplicity into a strength, we aim to achieve five goals: 1) improve model efficiency with higher predictive accuracy, 2) control the errors of incorrect magnitude and incorrect sign, 3) validate each model relative to competing candidates, 4) reduce the reliance and sensitivity on the choice of data space, and 5) encourage full results reporting. Our modeling proposal reverberates with recent proposals to eliminate the dichotomization of statistical evidence (\\\"significant\\\" vs. \\\"non-significant\\\"), to improve the interpretability of study findings, as well as to promote reporting the full gamut of results (not only \\\"significant\\\" ones), thereby enhancing research transparency and reproducibility.",

These cells were visualized during circulation, analyzed for their dynamical behavior and retrieved post-circulation. {gamma}-H2AX staining showed significant increase of DNA damage response in epithelial-like SK-BR-3 cells, while gene expression analysis of key regulators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition revealed significant increase of Twist2 relative expression in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells post-circulation.

    "abstract": "Investigations on the selection pressure acting on point mutations in PmrAB two-component system may provide insights into the future of colistin therapy in Acinetobacter baumannii, since mutations in pmrAB are implicated in colistin resistance. We performed adaptive selection analysis of pmrAB and compared with the available data on colistin resistant strains. We analysed PmrAB sequences in 3113 draft genomes of A. baumannii obtained from RefSeq database. Adaptive selection analysis was performed by two widely used programs namely, HyPhy and PAML. In addition, to examine the reliability of the approach, the same analysis was performed on gyrA of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, since adaptive mutations on gyrA confer quinolone resistance. Mutations that had caused colistin resistance were found to be neither adaptive nor polymorphic, rather they occur at sites that are either under neutral or purifying selection. Strong negative evolutionary selection pressure is also observed at sites throughout both PmrA and PmrB. Sites with high levels of polymorphisms in PmrAB were found to be under neutral selection. Notably, there was no sign of positive selection. Some of them are rather deleterious. These conditions might be maintaining the incidence of colistin resistance in A. baumannii under check. Therefore, in the context of colistin resistance, natural selection plays only a minor role and we assert that in future, A. baumannii may not be able to sustain and successfully disseminate colistin resistance. Therefore, at present the concerns raised about continuing the usage of colistin for the treatment against A. baumannii infections appears to be unnecessary.",

To date, many computational approaches have been developed to solve the resulting bilevel optimisation problems. However, most of them are of limited use due to biased optimality principle, poor scalability with the size of metabolic networks, potential numeric issues, or low quantity of design solutions in a single run. In this work, we have employed a network interdiction model free of growth optimality assumptions, a special case of bilevel optimisation, for computational strain design and have developed a hybrid Benders algorithm (HBA) that deals with complicating binary variables in the model, thereby achieving high efficiency without numeric issues in search of best design strategies. More importantly, HBA can list solutions that meet users production requirements during the search, making it possible to obtain numerous design strategies at a small runtime overhead (typically[~] 1 hour).",

    "abstract": "Exposure to even moderately bright, short-wavelength light in the evening can strongly suppress the production of melatonin and can delay our circadian rhythm. These effects are mediated by the retinohypothalamic pathway, connecting a subset of retinal ganglion cells to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain. These retinal ganglion cells directly express the photosensitive protein melanopsin, rendering them intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). But ipRGCs also receive input from the classical photoreceptors -- the cones and rods. Here, we examined whether the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones contribute to circadian photoreception by using lights which differed exclusively in the amount of S cone excitation by almost two orders of magnitude (ratio 1:83), but not in the excitation of long-wavelength-sensitive (L) and medium-wavelength-sensitive (M) cones, rods, and melanopsin. We find no evidence for a role of S cones in the acute alerting and melatonin supressing response to evening light exposure, pointing to an exclusive role of melanopsin in driving circadian responses.",

    "abstract": "Computing expectancy violations is essential for decision making and cognitive functions, but its neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. We describe a novel mechanism by which prefrontal and posterior parietal neurons encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) in their population but not single-neuron activity. Simultaneous recordings of neural populations showed that both areas co-activated information about experienced and expected rewards in a precise opponent organization. Neurons encoding expected rewards with positive (negative) scaling were reactivated simultaneously with those encoding experienced rewards with negative (positive) scaling. This opponent organization was mirrored in polarity-dependent noise correlations. Moreover, it extended to two types of expectancy information - based on task-relevant visual cues and statistically irrelevant reward history - allowing decoding of signed and unsigned RPE in two reference frames. Frontal and parietal areas implement canonical computations that facilitate contextual comparisons and the readout of multiple types of expectancy violations to flexibly serve behavioral goals.",

    "abstract": "Functions of proteins are in general related to their subcellular locations. To identify the functions of a protein, we first need know where this protein is located. Interacting proteins tend to locate in the same subcellular location. Thus, it is imperative to take the protein-protein interactions into account for computational identification of protein subcellular locations.In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, node2loc, to predict protein subcellular location. node2loc first learns distributed representations of proteins in a protein-protein network using node2vec, which acquires representations from unlabeled data for downstream tasks. Then the learned representations are further fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict subcellular locations. Considering the severe class imbalance of different subcellular locations, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to artificially boost subcellular locations with few proteins.We construct a benchmark dataset with 16 subcellular locations and evaluate node2loc on this dataset. node2loc yields a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.812, which outperforms other baseline methods. The results demonstrate that the learned presentations from a protein-protein network have strong discriminate ability for classifying protein subcellular locations and the RNN is a more powerful classifier than traditional machine learning models. node2loc is freely available at https://github.com/xypan1232/node2loc.",

    "abstract": "Our organs and tissues are in constant motion, exposing epithelial cells to mechanical stretch. However, how these external forces impact cellular morphology, organization and dynamics in healthy and diseased tissues is still being elucidated. In several studies, we and others have shown how mechanical stresses and strains in the epithelium can modulate the dynamics and invasiveness of transformed cells. Carcinoma, the most common type of cancer, develops in the sheets of cells forming the epithelium and lining our organs and cavities. It usually begins with the transformation of a single cell via the activation of oncogenes such as Ras. Here, we show in a model system how mechanical stretch in epithelial sheets results in a more invasive phenotype in transformed cells.\n\nCyclic strain prevents the formation of strong circumferential belts of actin in RasV12 cells and greatly promoting the formation of RasV12 protrusions, typical of a more invasive phenotype. We also show that RasV12 and wild type MDCK cells possess distinct sensitivity to strain. External forces remodel their actin cytoskeletons and adhesion complexes differently, resulting in a more invasive system dynamic. Our work demonstrates that the Rho-ROCK mechanotransduction pathway is involved in regulating a mechanically-induced switch to a more invasive phenotype. In a mechanically dynamic microenvironment, transformed cells exhibit drastically different cellular dynamics and movements when compared to static conditions. They grow larger invasive protrusions, potentially making them harder to be eliminated from healthy tissues. The insights gained in this study reveal the complex dynamics at play in healthy and transformed epithelial cells which are found in a mechanically active microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research have implicated the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in motivation, reinforcement learning and reward processing. We and others recently demonstrated that it also serves as an important node in sleep/wake circuitry. Specifically, VTA-dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to drive wakefulness and necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness. However, the role of VTA gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing neurons in arousal regulation is not fully understood. It is still unclear whether VTA-GABAergic neurons predictably alter their firing properties across arousal states, what is the nature of interactions between VTA-GABAergic activity and cortical neural oscillations, and how activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons relates to VTA-dopaminergic neurons in the context of sleep/wake regulation. To address these questions, we simultaneously recorded population activity from VTA-GABAergic or VTA-dopaminergic neurons and EEG/EMG signals during spontaneous sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli in freely-behaving male mice. We observed that VTA-GABAergic neurons exhibit robust arousal-state-dependent alterations in population activity, with high activity and calcium transients during wakefulness and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep compared to non-REM (NREM) sleep. During wakefulness, population activity of VTA-GABAergic neurons, but not VTA-dopaminergic neurons, was positively correlated with EEG gamma power and negatively correlated with EEG theta power. During NREM sleep, population activity in both VTA-GABAergic and VTA-dopaminergic neurons negatively correlated with delta, theta, and sigma EEG power bands. Salient stimuli, with both positive and negative valence, activated VTA-GABAergic neurons. The strongest activation was observed for social stimuli irrespective of valence. Together, our data indicate that VTA-GABAergic neurons, like their dopaminergic counterparts, drastically alter their activity across sleep-wake states. Changes in their activity predicts cortical oscillatory patterns reflected in the EEG, which are distinct from EEG spectra associated with dopaminergic neural activity.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceLittle is known about how ventral tegmental area (VTA) neural ensembles couple arousal to motivated behaviors. Using cell-type specific genetic tools, we investigated the population activity of GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons within the VTA across sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli. We demonstrate that coordinated neural activity within VTA-GABAergic neurons peaks during wakefulness and REM sleep. Furthermore, neuronal activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons is correlated with high frequency, low amplitude cortical oscillations during waking, but negatively correlated with high amplitude slower frequency oscillations during NREM sleep. Our results demonstrate that VTA-GABAergic neuronal activity is tightly linked to cortical arousal and highlight this population as a potential important node in sleep/wake regulation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate sensory processing during movement requires the animal to distinguish between external (exafferent) and self-generated (reafferent) stimuli to maintain sensitivity to biologically relevant cues. The lateral line system in fishes is a mechanosensory organ that experiences reafferent sensory feedback via detection of fluid motion relative to the body generated during behaviors such as swimming. For the first time in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), we employed simultaneous recordings of lateral line and motor activity to reveal the activity of afferent neurons arising from endogenous feedback from hindbrain efferent neurons during locomotion. Frequency of spontaneous spiking in posterior lateral line afferent neurons decreased during motor activity and was absent for more than half of swimming trials. Targeted photoablation of efferent neurons abolished the afferent inhibition that was correlated to swimming, indicating that inhibitory efferent neurons are necessary for modulating lateral line sensitivity during locomotion. We monitored calcium activity with Tg(elav13:GCaMP6s) fish and found synchronous activity between putative cholinergic efferent neurons and motor neurons. We examined correlates of motor activity to determine which may best predict the attenuation of afferent activity and therefore what components of the motor signal are translated through the corollary discharge. Swim duration was most strongly correlated to the change in afferent spike frequency. Attenuated spike frequency persisted past the end of the fictive swim bout, suggesting that corollary discharge also affects the glide phase of burst and glide locomotion. The duration of the glide in which spike frequency was attenuated increased with swim duration but decreased with motor frequency. Our results detail a neuromodulatory mechanism in larval zebrafish that adaptively filters self-generated flow stimuli during both the active and passive phases of locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Tremor is currently ranked as the most common movement disorder. The brain regions and neural signals that initiate the debilitating shakiness of different body parts remain unclear. Here, we found that genetically silencing cerebellar Purkinje cell activity blocked tremor in mice that were given the tremorgenic drug harmaline. We show in awake behaving mice that the onset of tremor is coincident with rhythmic Purkinje cell firing, which alters the output of their target cerebellar nuclei cells. We mimic the tremorgenic action of the drug with optogenetics and present evidence that highly patterned Purkinje cell activity drives a powerful tremor in otherwise normal mice. Modulating the altered activity with deep brain stimulation directed to the Purkinje cell output in the cerebellar nuclei reduced tremor in freely moving mice. Together, the data implicate Purkinje cell connectivity as a neural substrate for tremor and a gateway for signals that mediate the disease.",
