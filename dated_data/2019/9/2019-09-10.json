    "abstract": "Fate determination of germline stem cells remains poorly understood at the chromatin structure level1,2. Here, we demonstrate successful production of offspring from oocytes transdifferentiated from mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) with tracking of transplanted SSCs in vivo, single cell whole exome sequencing, and in 3D cell culture reconstitution of the process of oogenesis derived from SSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate direct induction of germline stem cells (iGSCs) differentiated into functional oocytes by transduction of H19, Stella, and Zfp57 and inactivation of Plzf in SSCs after screening with ovarian organoids. Using high throughput chromosome conformation, we uncovered extensive chromatin reorganization during SSC conversion into iGSCs, which was highly similar to female germline stem cells. We observed that although topologically associating domains were stable during SSC conversion, chromatin interactions changed in a striking manner, altering 35% of inactive and active chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. These findings have important implications in various areas including mammalian gametogenesis, genetic and epigenetic reprogramming, biotechnology, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "A primary function of the extracellular proteases of Staphylococcus aureus is to control the progression of infection by selectively modulating the stability of virulence factors. Consequently, a regulatory network exists to titrate protease abundance/activity, to influence accumulation, or lack thereof, of individual virulence factors. Herein, we comprehensively map this system, exploring regulation of the four protease loci by known and novel factors. In so doing, we determine that seven major elements (SarS, SarR, Rot, MgrA, CodY, SaeR, and SarA) form the primary network of control, with the latter three being the most powerful. We note that expression of aureolysin is largely repressed by these factors, whilst the spl operon is subject to the strongest upregulation of any protease loci, particularly by SarR and SaeR. Furthermore, when exploring scpA expression, we find it to be profoundly influenced in opposing fashions by SarA (repressor) and SarR (activator). We also present the screening of >100 regulator mutants of S. aureus, identifying 7 additional factors (ArgR2, AtlR, MntR, Rex, XdrA, Rbf, and SarU) that form a secondary circuit of protease control. Primarily these elements serve as activators, although we reveal XdrA as a new repressor of protease expression. With the exception or ArgR2, each of the new effectors appear to work through the primary network of regulation to influence protease production. Collectively, we present a comprehensive regulatory circuit that emphasizes the complexity of protease regulation and suggest that its existence speaks to the importance of these enzymes to S. aureus physiology and pathogenic potential.\\n\\nImportanceThe complex regulatory role of the proteases necessitates very tight coordination and control of their expression. Whilst this process has been well studied, a major oversight has been the consideration of proteases as a single entity, rather than 10 enzymes produced from four different promoters. As such, in this study we comprehensively characterized the regulation of each protease promoter, discovering vast differences in the way each protease operon is controlled. Additionally, we broaden the picture of protease regulation using a global screen to identify novel loci controlling protease activity, uncovering a cadre of new effectors of protease expression. The impact of these elements on the activity of proteases and known regulators was characterized producing a comprehensive regulatory circuit that emphasizes the complexity of protease regulation in Staphylococcus aureus.",

    "abstract": "There is strong interest in the valorization of lignin derived from plant biomass to produce valuable products; however, the structural complexity of this biopolymer has been a major bottleneck to conversion. Chemical pretreatment liberates soluble fractions of lignin that may be upgraded by biological conversion. Here, ionic liquid pretreatment was employed to obtain soluble aromatic-rich fractions from sorghum, which were converted by Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a promising host for bioconversion of aromatics derived from lignin. Growth studies and mutational analysis demonstrated that P. putida growth on these soluble lignin-derived fractions, referred to as lignolysate, was dependent on aromatic monomers derived from lignin (p-coumarate and ferulate), but other, unknown factors in the lignolysate contributed to growth. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses provided evidence that these unknown factors were amino acids and residual ionic liquid. Proteomic measurements indicated a coordinated response in which these substrates were catabolized simultaneously. A cholinium catabolic pathway was identified and deletion of five genes in the pathway abrogated the ability of P. putida to grow on cholinium as a sole carbon source. This work demonstrates that lignolysates obtained through biomass pretreatment contain multiple substrates and conversion strategies for lignin-derived should take this complexity into account.\\n\\nImportanceLignin is one of the most abundant biopolymers on Earth and is generated as a co-product in the processing of lignocellulosic biomass. Valorization of these residual lignin streams is a promising method to enhance the economic viability of modern lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study we developed a process to couple chemical depolymerization of lignin and biological conversion using Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Water-soluble and bioavailable lignolysate was obtained from sorghum and further characterized as a growth substrate for P. putida. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that P. putida metabolized other components of the lignolysate beyond monoaromatic compounds, which illuminates how microbes can process complex lignolysates obtained from plants. Understanding the underlying microbial responses in lignolysates will enable the design of rational strategies for lignin valorization.",

    "abstract": "Sequence learning is a vital cognitive function and has been observed in numerous brain areas. Discovering the algorithms underlying sequence learning has been a major endeavour in both neuroscience and machine learning. In earlier work we showed that by constraining the sparsity of the emission matrix of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a biologically-plausible manner we are able to efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies and recognize contexts in noisy signals. The central basis of our model, referred to as the Cloned HMM (CHMM), is the observation that cortical neurons sharing the same receptive field properties can learn to represent unique incidences of bottom-up information within different temporal contexts. CHMMs can efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies, recognize long-range contexts and, unlike recurrent neural networks, are able to natively handle uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a biologically plausible CHMM learning algorithm, memorize-generalize, that can rapidly memorize sequences as they are encountered, and gradually generalize as more data is accumulated. We demonstrate that CHMMs trained with the memorize-generalize algorithm can model long-range structure in bird songs with only a slight degradation in performance compared to expectation-maximization, while still outperforming other representations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanics force fields have been shown to differ in their predictions of processes such as protein folding. To test how force field differences affect predicted protein behavior, we created a mechanically perturbed model of the beta-stranded I91 titin domain based on atomic force spectroscopy data and examined its refolding behavior using six different force fields. To examine the transferability of the force field discrepancies identified by this model, we compared the results to equilibrium simulations of the weakly helical peptide Ac-(AAQAA)3-NH2. The total simulation time was 80 {micro}s. From these simulations we found significant differences in I91 perturbation refolding ability between force fields. Concurrently, Ac-(AAQAA)3-NH2 equilibration experiments indicated that although force fields have similar overall helical frequencies, they can differ in helical lifetimes. The combination of these results suggests that differences in force field parameterization may allow a more direct transition between the beta and alpha regions of the Ramachandran plot thereby affecting both beta-strand refolding ability and helical lifetimes. Furthermore, the combination of results suggests that using mechanically perturbed models can provide a controlled method to gain more insight into how force fields affect protein behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is activated by forming a complex with dynactin and the adaptor protein BicD2. We used Interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to track dynein-dynactin-BicD2 (DDB) complexes in vitro and developed a regression-based algorithm to classify switching between processive, diffusive and stuck motility states. We find that DDB spends 65% of its time undergoing processive stepping, 4% undergoing 1D diffusion, and the remaining time transiently stuck to the microtubule. Although the p150 subunit was previously shown to enable dynactin diffusion along microtubules, blocking p150 enhanced the proportion of time DDB diffused and reduced the time DDB processively walked. Thus, DDB diffusive behavior most likely results from dynein switching into an inactive (diffusive) state, rather than p150 tethering the complex to the microtubule. DDB - kinesin-1 complexes, formed using a DNA adapter, moved slowly and persistently, and blocking p150 led to a 70 nm/s plus-end shift in the average velocity, in quantitative agreement with the increase in diffusivity seen in isolated DDB. The data suggest a DDB activation model in which engagement of dynactin p150 with the microtubule promotes dynein processivity, serves as an allosteric activator of dynein, and enhances processive minus-end motility during intracellular bidirectional transport.\\n\\nTOC HighlightDynein-dynactin-BicD2 (DDB) is highly processive, but also shows transient pausing and diffusion, which we analyzed using iSCAT microscopy. Blocking dynactin p150 results in more diffusion of isolated DDB and a plus-end shift of kinesin-1 - DDB complexes. Thus, we conclude that p150 is an allosteric activator of dynein in the DDB complex.",

Here, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) combined with mass spectrometry to determine pluripotency proteome dynamics during cell cycle in mouse ESCs. We found the S/G2M-fluctuating pluripotency transcription factors (ESRRB, REST), chromatin regulators (JARID2, TRIM24) and proteins with E3 ligase activity (NEDD4L, PIAS2) to peak in S phase. This expression balance was disrupted upon inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity resulting in the shift of the expression peak from S to G2M.

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis with approximately 20 million cases per year globally. While HEV is endemic in certain regions of Asia, Africa and South America, it is considered an emerging foodborne pathogen in developed countries. Based on genetic diversity, HEV is classified into different genotypes, with genotype 3 (HEV-3) being most prevalent in Europe and North America. The transmission of HEV-3 has been shown to be zoonotic and mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork products. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of high-pressure processing (HPP) in the inactivation of HEV-3 using a cell culture system. HPP has been indicated as a promising nonthermal pathogen inactivation strategy for treatment of certain high-risk food commodities, without any noticeable changes in their nature. For this purpose, we treated HEV-3 in media as well as in artificially inoculated pork pate, with different conditions of HPP: 400 MPa for 1 and 5 minutes, as well as 600 MPa for 1 and 5 minutes, at ambient temperature. In general, we observed approximately a 2-log reduction in HEV load by HPP treatments in media; however, similar treatment in the pork pate resulted in a much lower reduction in viral load. Therefore, the efficacy of HPP treatment in the inactivation of HEV-3 is matrix-dependent.\\n\\nImportanceHEV is an emerging foodborne pathogen in industrialized countries, and its transmission is associated with the consumption of contaminated undercooked pork product. In this work, we employed an infectivity assay to investigate the potential of high-pressure in inactivation of HEV in media and ready-to-eat pork pate. We demonstrated that the effect of HPP on inactivation of HEV depends on the surrounding matrix.",

We experimentally validated the function of a putative mercury resistance operon present on an abundant 8 kilobase pair native plasmid found in groundwater samples without detectable levels of mercury. Phylogenetic analyses of the plasmid-encoded mercury reductases from the studied groundwater site show them to be distinct from those reported in proximal metal-contaminated sites. We synthesized the entire native plasmid and demonstrated that the plasmid was sufficient to confer functional mercury resistance in Escherichia coli. Given the possibility that natural transformation is a prevalent HGT mechanism in the low cell density environments of groundwaters, we also assayed bacterial strains from this environment for competence. We used the native plasmid-encoded metal resistance to design a screen and identified 17 strains positive for natural transformation. We selected 2 of the positive strains along with a model bacterium to fully confirm HGT via natural transformation. From an ecological perspective, the role of the native plasmid population in providing advantageous traits combined with the microbiomes capacity to take up environmental DNA enables rapid adaptation to environmental stresses.\\n\\nImportanceHorizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements via natural transformation has been poorly understood in environmental microbes. Here, we confirm the functionality of a native plasmid-encoded mercury resistance operon in a model microbe and then query for the dissemination of this resistance trait via natural transformation into environmental bacterial isolates.

The traditional approach relies on signal from a DNA stain, or fluorescent transgene expression localised to the nucleus. However, imaging techniques that do not use fluorescence can also carry useful information. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately segment nuclei directly from brightfield images using deep learning. We confirmed that three convolutional neural network architectures can be adapted for this task, with U-Net achieving the best overall performance, Mask R-CNN providing an additional benefit of instance segmentation, and DeepCell proving too slow for practical application. We found that accurate segmentation is possible using as few as 16 training images and that models trained on images from similar cell lines can extrapolate well. Acquiring data from multiple focal planes further helps distinguish nuclei in the samples.

Network-based analysis implemented by SWIM software can be exploited to identify key molecular switches - called \\\"switch genes\\\" - for disease. Genes contributing to common biological processes or define given cell types are frequently co-regulated and co-expressed, giving rise to expression network modules. Consistently, we found that the COPD correlation network built by SWIM consists of three well-characterized modules: one populated by switch genes, all up-regulated in COPD cases and related to the regulation of immune response, inflammatory response, and hypoxia (like TIMP1, HIF1A, SYK, LY96, BLNK and PRDX4); one populated by well-recognized immune signature genes, all up-regulated in COPD cases; one where the GWAS genes AGER and CAVIN1 are the most representative module genes, both down-regulated in COPD cases. Interestingly, 70% of AGER negative interactors are switch genes including PRDX4, whose activation strongly correlates with the activation of known COPD GWAS interactors SERPINE2, CD79A, and POUF2AF1.

We use phylogenetically corrected least squares regression to explore the differences in the trade-offs between life history traits in both realms. We then quantify the life history strategies of aquatic and terrestrial species using a phylogenetically corrected principal component analysis.\\n\\nResultsWe find that the same trade-offs structure terrestrial and aquatic life histories, resulting in two dominant axes of variation describing species pace- of-life and reproductive spread through time. Life history strategies differ between aquatic and terrestrial environments, with phylogenetic relationships playing a minor role. We show that adaptations of plants and animals to terrestrial environments have resulted in different life history strategies, particularly with their reproductive mode and longevity. Terrestrial plants display a great diversity of life history strategies, including the species with the longest lifespans. Aquatic animals, on the contrary, exhibit higher reproductive frequency than terrestrial animals, likely due to reproductive adaptations (i.e. internal fecundation) of the later to land.\\n\\nMain conclusionsOur findings show that aquatic and terrestrial species are ruled by the same life history principles, but have evolved different strategies due to distinct selection pressures. Such contrasting life history strategies have important consequences for the conservation and management of aquatic and terrestrial species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) disproportionately affect hospitalized patients due to the combination of comorbidities, frequent antimicrobial use, and in-hospital MDRO transmission. Identification of MDRO transmission by hospital microbiology laboratories is difficult due to limitations of existing typing methods.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective multicenter genomics implementation study (8 hospitals, 2800 beds) from 24th April to 18th June 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. Clinical and screening isolates from hospital inpatients were collected for six MDROs (vanA VRE, MRSA, ESBL E. coli [ESBL-Ec] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [ESBL-Kp], and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [CRPa] and Acinetobacter baumannii [CRAb]), sequenced (Illumina NextSeq) and analyzed using open-source tools. MDRO transmission was assessed by genomics (core SNP phylogeny, grouped by species and ST) and compared to epidemiologic data.\\n\\nResults408 isolates were collected from 358 patients; 47.5% were screening isolates. ESBL-Ec was most common (52.5%), then MRSA (21.6%), vanA VRE (15.7%) and ESBL-Kp (7.6%).\\n\\nWe define the transmission rate for each MDRO by genomics and epidemiology; 31.6% of all study patients had potential genomic links to other study isolates; 86% of these were confirmed by epidemiologic links (probable or possible transmission). The highest transmission rates occurred with vanA VRE (88.4% of patients).\\n\\nConclusionsCombining genomics with high-quality epidemiologic data gives substantial insights into the burden and distribution of critical MDROs in hospitals, including in-hospital transmission. By defining transmission rates by genomics, we hope to enable comparisons over time and between sites, and introduce this as a new outcome measure to assess the efficacy of infection control interventions.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a key mediator of stress response and a broad range of physiological processes. How can GR rapidly activate the expression of some genes while repress others, remains an open question due to the challenge to associate GR binding sites (GBSs) to their distant gene targets. Mapping the full 3D scope of GR-responsive promoters using high-resolution 4C-seq unravelled spatial separation between chromatin interaction networks of GR-activated and repressed genes. Analysing GR binding sites and other regulatory loci in their functional 3D context revealed that GR sequesters the co-activator Ep300 from active non-GBS enhancers in both activated and repressed gene compartments. While this is sufficient for rapid gene repression, gene activation is countered by productive recruitment of Ep300 to GBS. Importantly, in GR-activated compartments Klf4 binding at non-GBS regulatory elements cluster in 3D with GBS and antagonizes GR activation. In addition, we revealed ROR and Rev-erb transcription factors as novel co-regulators for GR-mediated gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Insects are highly successful, in part through an excellent ability to osmoregulate. The renal (Malpighian) tubules can secrete fluid faster on a per-cell basis than any other epithelium, but the route for these remarkable water fluxes has not been established. In Drosophila melanogaster, we show that 4 members of the Major Intrinsic Protein family are expressed at very high level in the fly renal tissue; the aquaporins Drip and Prip, and the aquaglyceroporins Eglp2 and Eglp4. As predicted from their structure and by their transport function by expressing these proteins in Xenopus oocytes, Drip, Prip and Eglp2 show significant and specific water permeability, whereas Eglp2 and Eglp4 show very high permeability to glycerol and urea. Knockdowns of any of these genes impacts tubule performance resulting in impaired hormone-induced fluid secretion. The Drosophila tubule has two main secretory cell types: active cation-transporting principal cells with the aquaglyceroporins localize to opposite plasma membranes and small stellate cells, the site of the chloride shunt conductance, with these aquaporins localising to opposite plasma membranes. This suggests a model in which cations are pumped by the principal cells, causing chloride to follow through the stellate cells in order to balance the charge. As a consequence, osmotically obliged water follows through the stellate cells. Consistent with this model, fluorescently labelled dextran, an in vivo marker of membrane water permeability, is trapped in the basal infoldings of the stellate cells after kinin diuretic peptide stimulation, confirming that these cells provide the major route for transepithelial water flux. The spatial segregation of these components of epithelial water transport may help to explain the unique success of the higher insects.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe tiny insect renal (Malpighian) tubule can transport fluid at unparalleled speed, suggesting unique specialisations. Here we show that strategic allocation of Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIPs) to specific cells within the polarized tubule allow the separation of metabolically intense active cation transport from chloride and water conductance. This body plan is general to at least many higher insects, providing a clue to the unique success of the class Insecta.",

    "abstract": "The basal lamina is a specialized sheet of dense extracellular matrix (ECM), linked to the plasma membrane of specific cell types in their tissue context, that serves as a structural scaffold for organ genesis and maintenance. Disruption of the basal lamina and its functions is central to many disease processes, including cancer metastasis, kidney disease, eye disease, muscular dystrophies, and specific types of brain malformation. The latter three pathologies occur in the dystroglycanopathies, which are caused by dysfunction of the ECM receptor dystroglycan. However, opportunities to study the basal lamina in various human disease tissues are restricted due to its limited accessibility. Here, we report the generation of embryoid bodies from human induced pluripotent stem cells to model basal lamina formation. Embryoid bodies cultured via this protocol mimic pre-gastrulation embryonic development, consisting of an epithelial core surrounded by a basal lamina and a peripheral layer of ECM-secreting endoderm. In dystroglycanopathy patient embryoid bodies, electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed ultrastructural basal lamina defects and reduced ECM assembly. By starting from patient-derived cells, these results establish a method for the in vitro synthesis of patient-specific basal lamina and recapitulate disease-relevant ECM defects seen in muscular dystrophies. Finally, we applied this system to evaluate an experimental ribitol supplement therapy on genetically diverse dystroglycanopathy patient samples.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protocols and methods to robustly detect the mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) are needed given its reported role in cancer, several age-related disorders and overall male mortality. Intensity SNP-array data have been used to infer mLOY status and to determine its prominent role in male disease. However, discrepancies of reported findings can be due to the uncertainty and variability of the methods used for mLOY detection and to the differences in the tissue-matrix used. We proposed MADloy, the first publicly available software tool that incorporates previous methods and includes a new robust approach, allowing efficient calling in large studies and comparisons between methods. The new method implemented in MADloy optimizes mLOY calling by correctly modeling the underlying reference population with no-mLOY status and incorporating B-deviation information. We observed improvements in the calling accuracy with respect to previous methods, using experimentally validated samples, and an increment in the statistical power to detect associations with disease and mortality, using simulation studies and real dataset analyses. We applied MADloy to detect the increment of mLOY cellularity in blood on 18 individuals after 3 years, and to confirm that its detection in saliva was sub-optimal (41%). We illustrate the use of MADloy to detect the down-regulation genes in the chromosome Y in kidney and bladder tumors with mLOY, and to perform pathway analyses for the detection of mLOY in blood. MADloy is a new software tool implemented in R for easy and robust calling of mLOY status in men aimed to facilitate its study in large epidemiological studies.",

We previously demonstrated activation of the cGAS-STING pathway following loss of DNA repair, resulting in cytokine induction, lymphocytic infiltration and immune checkpoint activation. Here we explore the role of chemotherapies in inducing this innate immune response, identifying topoisomerase II (topo-II) inhibitors, particularly doxorubicin and epirubicin, as potent inducers of a cGAS-STING dependent interferon response. Mechanistically, topo-II inhibition resulted in significant induction of cytoplasmic DNA and subsequent micronuclei formation, a requirement for efficient cGAS-STING activation and consequent cytokine and immune checkpoint gene induction. Importantly, increased cytokine and immune checkpoint gene expression, as well as increased immune cell infiltration, was also observed in patient derived breast tumour biopsies following topo-II inhibitor-based treatment. Taken together, this study indicates topo-II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, may be best placed to induce immunogenic inflammation, and thereby increase responses to ICB therapies.\\n\\nSignificanceThis work demonstrates how topo-II inhibitors induce STING-pathway activation, cytokine induction and immune checkpoint protein upregulation in cancer cells and provides a rationale for combining topo-II inhibitors with ICB therapy in early breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances, the dynamics of genome architecture and chromatin function during human cell differentiation and its potential reorganization upon neoplastic transformation remains poorly characterized. Here, we integrate in situ Hi-C and nine additional omic layers to define and biologically characterize the dynamic changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture across normal B cell differentiation and in neoplastic cells from different subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. Beyond conventional active (A) and inactive (B) compartments, an integrative analysis of Hi-C data reveals the presence of a highly-dynamic intermediate compartment enriched in poised and polycomb-repressed chromatin. During B cell development, we detect that 28% of the compartments change at defined maturation stages and mostly involve the intermediate compartment. The transition from naive to germinal center B cells is associated with widespread chromatin activation, which mostly reverts into the naive state upon further maturation of germinal center cells into memory B cells. The analysis of CLL and MCL neoplastic cells points both to entity and subtype-specific alterations in chromosome organization. Remarkably, we observe that large chromatin blocks containing key disease-specific genes alter their 3D genome organization. These include the inactivation of a 2Mb region containing the EBF1 gene in CLL and the activation of a 6.1Mb region containing the SOX11 gene in clinically aggressive MCL. This study indicates that 3D genome interactions are extensively modulated during normal B cell differentiation and that the genome of B cell neoplasias acquires a tumor-specific 3D genome architecture.",

Europe and French overseas territories in the Indian Ocean have been so far spared despite the presence of Ae. albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. However, because they have strong economic and touristic links with regions affected by ZIKV, French territories in the Indian Ocean have a high risk of introduction. Here, we assess the susceptibility of two Ae. albopictus populations from Metropolitan France and the Reunion island (a French oversea territory in the Indian Ocean) for a ZIKV isolate from the Asian genotype at a titer ranging from 3 to 7.5 x 106 focus-forming units per milliliter. High infection rates and unpreceded levels of systemic infection rates were observed in both Metropolitan France and the Reunion island populations, without differences in infection rates or intra-mosquito systemic infection dynamics between the two mosquito populations. Ten and 20-days were needed by the virus to disseminate in 50% and 100% of the exposed mosquitoes respectively. Such slow intra-mosquito viral dynamics, in addition to repeatedly reported high transmission barrier in the literature, can impact ZIKV transmission when potentially vectored by Ae. albopictus. However, because mosquito-borne virus intra-host transmission dynamics can be influenced by numerous factors, including virus dose dynamics inside infectious humans or viral evolution towards shorter extrinsic incubation periods (EIP), our results highlight that Ae. albopictus populations present in Metropolitan France and the French territoires in the Indian Ocean might become potential vector for autochthonous ZIKV transmissions.",

Whether this function is hampered by an underlying rhythmic mechanism is unknown. In six interrelated experiments, we behaviourally quantify the sampling capacities of periodic temporal attention during auditory or visual perception. We reveal the presence of limited attentional capacities, with an optimal sampling rate of ~1.4 Hz in audition and ~0.7 Hz in vision. Investigating the motor contribution to temporal attention, we show that it scales with motor rhythmic precision, maximal at ~1.7 Hz. Critically, the motor modulation is beneficial to auditory but detrimental to visual temporal attention. These results are captured by a computational model of coupled oscillators, that reveals the underlying structural constraints governing the temporal alignment between motor and attention fluctuations.",

Kinematic measurements of Eigenmannia were used to generate individualized estimates of each fishs locomotor plant and controller revealing substantial variability between fish. To test the impact of this variability on behavioral performance, these models were used to perform simulated  brain transplants--computationally swapping controllers and plants between individuals. We found that simulated closed-loop performance was robust to mismatch between plant and controller.

    "abstract": "Cerebellar granule cells (GCs) making up majority of all the neurons in the vertebrate brain, but heterogeneities among GCs and potential functional consequences are poorly understood. Here, we identified unexpected gradients in the biophysical properties of GCs. GCs closer to the white matter (inner-zone GCs) had higher firing thresholds and could sustain firing with larger current inputs. Dynamic clamp experiments showed that inner- and outer-zone GCs preferentially respond to high- and low-frequency mossy fiber inputs, respectively, enabling to disperse the mossy fiber input into its frequency components as performed by a Fourier transformation. Furthermore, inner-zone GCs have faster axonal conduction velocity and elicit faster synaptic potentials in Purkinje cells. Neuronal network modeling revealed that these gradients improve spike-timing precision of Purkinje cells and decrease the number of GCs required to learn spike-sequences. Thus, our study uncovers biophysical gradients in the cerebellar cortex enabling a Fourier-like transformation of mossy fiber inputs.",

    "abstract": "Animals sense ambient temperature so that they can adjust their behavior to the environment; they avoid noxious heat and coldness and stay within a survivable temperature range. C. elegans can sense temperature, memorize past cultivation temperature and navigate towards preferable temperature, for which a thermosensory neuron, AFD, is essential. AFD responds to temperature increase from the past cultivation temperature by increasing intracellular Ca2+ level. We aimed to reveal how AFD encodes and memorizes the information of temperature. Although cGMP synthesis is crucial for thermosensation by AFD, whether and how cGMP level temporally fluctuates in AFD remained elusive. We therefore monitored cGMP level in AFD and found that cGMP dynamically responded to temperature change in a manner dependent on past cultivation temperature. Given that cGMP dynamics is supposed to be upstream of Ca2+ dynamics, our results suggest that AFDs memory is formed by simpler molecular mechanisms than previously expected from the Ca2+ dynamics. Moreover, we analyzed how guanylyl cyclases and phosphodiesterases, which synthesize and degrade cGMP, respectively, contributed to cGMP and Ca2+ dynamics and thermotaxis behavior.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSeveral recent studies have utilized a 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution pipeline to obtain quantitative metrics of brain tissue microstructure from diffusion-weighted MRI data. The three tissue compartments, comprising white matter-, grey matter-, and CSF-like (free water) signals, are potentially useful in the evaluation of brain microstructure in a range of pathologies. However, the reliability and long-term stability of these metrics has not yet been evaluated.\\n\\nMethodsThis study examined estimates of whole brain microstructure for the three tissue compartments, in three separate test-retest cohorts. Each cohort has different lengths of time between baseline and retest, ranging from within the same scanning session in the shortest interval to three months in the longest interval. Each cohort was also collected with different acquisition parameters.\\n\\nResultsThe CSF-like compartment displayed the greatest reliability across all cohorts, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values being above 0.95 in each cohort. White matter-like and grey matter-like compartments both demonstrated very high reliability in the immediate cohort (both ICC>0.90), however this declined in the 3 month interval cohort to both compartments having ICC>0.80. Regional CSF-like signal fraction was examined in bilateral hippocampus and had an ICC>0.80 in each cohort.\\n\\nConclusionThe 3-tissue CSD techniques provide reliable and stable estimates of tissue microstructure composition, up to 3 months longitudinally in a control population. This forms an important basis for further investigations utilizing 3-tissue CSD techniques to track changes in microstructure across a variety of brain pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Novel pathogens can cause massive declines in populations, and even extirpation of hosts. But disease can also act as a selective pressure on survivors, driving the evolution of resistance or tolerance. Bat white-nose syndrome (WNS) is a rapidly spreading wildlife disease in North America. The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low FST values within the population across time, i.e. prior to WNS (Pre-WNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for specific alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene flow within the population. However, the persistence of remnant sub-populations in the aftermath of WNS is likely due to multiple factors in bat life history.",

Here we searched for gene expression traits separating humans from other primates by analyzing 88,047 cell nuclei and 422 tissue samples representing 33 brain regions of humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and macaques. We show that gene expression evolves rapidly within cell types, with more than two-thirds of cell type-specific differences not detected using conventional RNA sequencing of tissue samples. Neurons tend to evolve faster in all hominids, but non-neuronal cell types, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors, show more differences on the human lineage, including alterations of spatial distribution across neocortical layers.",

    "abstract": "The cognitive map is often assumed to be a Euclidean map that isometrically represents the real world (i.e. the Euclidean distance between any two locations in the physical world should be preserved on the cognitive map). However, accumulating evidence suggests that environmental boundaries can distort the mental representations of a physical space. For example, the distance between two locations can be remembered as longer than the true physical distance if the locations are separated by a boundary. While this overestimation is observed under different experimental conditions, even when the boundary is formed by flat surface cues, its physiological basis is not well understood. We examined the neural representation of flat surface cue boundaries, and of the space segregated by these boundaries, by recording place cell activity from dorsal CA1 and CA3 while rats foraged on a circular track or square platform with inhomogeneous surface textures. About 40% of the place field edges concentrated near the surface cue boundaries on the circular track (significantly above the chance level 33%). Similarly, the place field edges were more prevalent near the boundaries on the platforms than expected by chance. In both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional environments, the population vectors of place cell activity changed more abruptly with distance between locations that crossed cue boundaries than between locations within a bounded region. These results show that the locations of surface boundaries were evident as enhanced decorrelations of the neural representations of locations to either side of the boundaries. This enhancement might underlie the cognitive phenomenon of overestimation of distances across boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Gender has been investigated in psycholinguistics research both with respect to how it is retrieved when a noun is encountered and the computation of its agreement dependencies between different elements in a sentence. The literature is abound with differences as to the processing of gender agreement computations across languages and constructs. Similarly, neurophysiological evidence with respect to gender retrieval mechanisms differ wherein languages differ in the way the gender feature is retrieved when a noun is encountered based on different properties. The present study aims to scrutinize gender agreement computations in verb-agreement relations in Hindi and to ascertain if the intrinsic property (i.e. the animacy) of a noun participating in the relation plays a role in processing agreement dependencies. In addition, it also looks into the issue of whether the gender retrieval mechanism in the language influences agreement comprehension. Results revealed a positivity for the animate subject agreement and a negativity for the inanimate subject agreement violations at the position of the verb respectively. The results are suggestive of distinct processing mechanisms underlying semantic and syntactic gender. Further, the results also suggest that gender agreement computation in Hindi is modulated by the way gender is retrieved at the position of the noun.",

    "abstract": "Reliable quantification of protein extracts from tissues can be a challenge e.g. due to interference of the high fat content in tissues of the nervous system. Further problems like under- or overerstimation of protein concentrations in protein quantification kits like the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay can occur. In addition, common lysis buffers such as RIPA buffer are known to be unable to solubilize a large amount of proteins (~10-30%) leading to unsatisfactory and unreliable experimental results with techniques such as immunoblotting. In this work, we have developed a Ponceau S staining based protein quantification assay. This assay is compatible with tissues or cells directly lysed in 2x SDS gel loading buffer, containing bromophenolblue, leading to more complete protein extraction. Protein concentrations of several samples can be determined in a fast and cost-effective manner and subsequent experiments (e.g. Western blot) can be performed without loss of proteins. The presented protein quantification method is highly reliable, fast and economical. Using this method, it is possible to save between 2300 to 3200{euro} per 1000 lysates as compared to the costs of a commercial BCA kit.",

    "abstract": "Clinical assessment of spinal motion in horses is part of many routine clinical exams but remains highly subjective. A prerequisite for the quantification is the assessment of the expected normal range of motion and variability of back kinematics. The aim of this study was to objectively quantify spinal kinematics and between-measurement, -surface and -day variation in owner-sound horses. In an observational study, twelve owner-sound horses were trotted 12 times on four different paths (hard/soft straight line, soft lunge left and right). Measurements were divided over three days, with five repetitions on day one and two, and two repetitions on day three (recheck) which occurred 28-55 days later. Optical motion capture was used to collect kinematic data. Elements of the outcome were: 1) Ranges of Motion (ROM) with confidence intervals per path and surface, 2) a variability model to calculate between-measurement variation and test the effect of time, surface and path, 3) intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to determine repeatability. ROM was lowest on the hard straight line. Cervical lateral bending was doubled on the left compared to the right lunge. Mean variation for the flexion-extension and lateral bending of the whole back were 0.8 and 1 degrees. Pelvic motion showed a variation of 1.0 (pitch), 0.7 (yaw) and 1.3 (roll) degrees. For these five parameters, a tendency for more variation on the hard surface and reduced variation with increased repetitions was observed. More variation was seen on the recheck (p<0.001). ICC values for the pelvis were between 0.76 and 0.93, for the whole back flexion-extension and lateral bending between 0.51 and 0.91. Between-horse variation was substantially higher than within-horse variation. Concluding, ROM and variation in spinal biomechanics are horse-specific and small, necessitating individual analysis and making subjective clinical assessment of spinal kinematics challenging.",

The results showed that at the behavioral level, participants in the negative feedback condition received higher test scores than those in the positive feedback condition; at the physiological level, the four kinds of ERPs evoked by both negative and positive feedback are P200, P300, and FRN. Compared with the non-feedback condition, P300 is more sensitive to negative feedback, and negative feedback induces larger amplitude, while P300 is not sensitive to positive feedback. For both negative and positive feedback, when feedback was presented after 200-300ms, the reaction to errors induced FRN production, and FRN produced under negative feedback condition led to more activation. This research has deepened our understanding of the influence of feedback valence on category learning from the brain mechanisms as well.",
