    "abstract": "Transgenic corn and cotton produce crystalline (Cry) proteins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that are toxic to lepidopteran larvae. Helicoverpa zea, a key pest of corn and cotton in the U.S., has evolved widespread resistance to these proteins produced in Bt corn and cotton. While the genomic targets of Cry selection and the mutations that produce resistant phenotypes are known in other lepidopteran species, little is known about how Cry proteins shape the genome of H. zea. We scanned the genomes of Cry1Ac-selected and unselected H. zea lines, and identified eleven genes on six scaffolds that showed evidence of selection by Cry1Ac, including cadherin-86C (cad-86C), a gene from a family that is involved in Cry1A resistance in other lepidopterans. Although this gene was expressed in the H. zea larval midgut, the protein it encodes has only 17 to 22% identity with cadherin proteins from other species previously reported to be involved in Bt resistance. An analysis of midgut-expressed cDNAs showed significant between-line differences in the frequencies of putative nonsynonymous substitutions (both SNPs and indels). Our results indicate that cad-86C is a target of Cry1Ac selection in H. zea. Future work should investigate phenotypic effects of these nonsynonymous substitutions and their impact on phenotypic resistance in field populations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIridescent colours are colours that change depending on the angle of illumination or observation. They are produced when light is reflected by multilayer structures or diffracted by gratings. While this phenomenon is well understood for simple optical systems, it remains unclear how complex biological structures interact with light to produce iridescence. There are very few comparative studies at interspecific level (often focusing on a single colour patch for each species), resulting in an underestimation of structure diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining physics and biology, we here quantify the colour and structure of 36 hummingbirds species evenly distributed across the phylogeny. We explore at least 2 patches per species, which are assumed to be under different selective regimes. For each patch, we measure structural features (number of layers, layer width, irregularity, spacing, etc.) of the feathers at different scales using both optical and electronic microscopy and we measure colour using a novel approach we developed to encompass the full complexity of iridescence, including its angular dependency. We discover an unsuspected diversity of structures producing iridescence in hummingbirds. We also study the effect of several structural features on the colour of the resulting signal, using both an empirical and modelling approach. Our findings demonstrate the need to take into account multiple patches per species and suggest possible evolutionary pressures causing the evolutionary transitions from one melanosome type to another.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression variation between alleles in a diploid cell is mediated by variation in cis regulatory sequences, which usually refers to the differences in DNA sequence between two alleles near the gene of interest. Expression differences caused by cis variation has been estimated by the ratio of the expression level of the two alleles under a binomial model. However, the binomial model underestimates the variance among replicated experiments resulting in the exaggerated statistical significance of estimated cis effects and thus many false discoveries of cis-affected genes. Here we describe a beta-binomial model that estimates the cis-effect for each gene while permitting overdispersion of variance among replicates. We demonstrated with simulated null data (data without true cis-effect) that the new model fits the true distribution better, resulting in approximately 5% false positive rate under 5% significance level in all null datasets, considerably better than the 6%-40% false positive rate of the binomial model. Additional replicates increase the performance of the beta-binomial model but not of the binomial model. We also collected new allele-specific expression data from an experiment comprised of 20 replicates of a yeast hybrid (YPS128/RM11-1a). We eliminated the mapping bias problem with de novo assemblies of the two parental genomes. By applying the beta-binomial model to this dataset, we found that cis effects are ubiquitous, affecting around 70% of genes. However, most of these changes are small in magnitude. The high number of replicates enabled us a better approximation of cis landscape within species and also provides a resource for future exploration for better models.",

    "abstract": "MotivationShort-read draft paired-end Illumina assemblies can be fragmented, contain many contigs and be impacted on by repeat regions, caused by mobile element activity within the genome or inherently repetitive gene structure. Annotating such assemblies for function and analysing gene content can be challenging if predicted genes are fragmented across contigs. Such a case can often occur within specific families of genes such as longer genes with repeating domains, genes specifying several transmembrane domains and of unusual nucleotide content. These genes can often be virulence determinants, therefore losing these specific types of data can seriously impact downstream studies.\\n\\nResultsRather than studying the predicted gene content of draft genomes, we examined predicted protein content using the Pfam domain complements of predicted proteins. We produced a workflow, Punchline, to study the genetic content of draft contig assemblies by looking at the complement of short domains that are unlikely to be affected. We investigated a dataset of Bacteroides ovatus in terms of a grouping involving the vertebrate host from which the organism was isolated and identified potential host restricted functions and host restricted phylogenetic clustering.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/LCrossman\\n\\nContact: seq@sequenceanalysis.co.uk",

    "abstract": "Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions can have critical consequences for cellular homeostasis. An elaborate surveillance system known as ER quality control (ERQC) ensures that only correctly assembled proteins reach their destination. Persistence of misfolded or improperly matured proteins upregulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to cope with stress, activates ER associated degradation (ERAD) for delivery to proteasomes for degradation. We have identified a Brucella abortus type IV secretion system effector called BspL that targets Herp, a key component of ERQC and is able to augment ERAD. Modulation of ERQC by BspL results in tight control of the kinetics of autophagic Brucella-containing vacuole formation, preventing premature bacterial egress from infected cells. This study highlights how bacterial pathogens may hijack ERAD components for fine regulation of their intracellular trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Many major marine bacterial lineages such as SAR11, Prochlorococcus, SAR116, and several Roseobacter lineages have members that are abundant, relatively slow-growing, and genome-streamlined. The isolation of phages that infect SAR11 and SAR116 have demonstrated the dominance of these phages in the marine virosphere. However, no phages have been isolated from bacteria in the Roseobacter RCA lineage, another abundant group of bacteria in the ocean. In this study, seven RCA phages that infect three different RCA strains were isolated and characterized. All seven RCA phages belong to the Podoviridae family and have genome sizes ranging from 39.6 to 58.1 kb. Interestingly, three RCA phages (CRP-1, CRP-2 and CRP-3) show a similar genomic content and architecture with SAR116 phage HMO-2011, which represents one of the most abundant known viral groups in the ocean. The high degree of homology between CRP-1, CRP-2, CRP-3 and HMO-2011 resulted in contribution of the RCA phages to the dominance of HMO-2011-type phage in the ocean. CRP-4 and CRP-5 are similar to the Siovirus roseophages in terms of gene content and organization. The remaining two RCA phages, CRP-6 and CRP-7, show limited genomic similarity with known phages and appear to form two new phage genera. Metagenomic fragment recruitment analyses reveal that these RCA phage groups are much more abundant in the ocean compared to most existing marine roseophage groups. The characterization of these RCA phages has greatly expanded our understanding of the genomic diversity and evolution of marine roseophages. Metagenomic fragment recruitment analyses suggest the critical need for isolating phages from the abundant but \\\"unculturable\\\" bacteria in the marine ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (commercially available as Ursodiol) is a naturally occurring bile acid that is used to treat a variety of hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases. Ursodiol can modulate bile acid pools, which have the potential to alter the gut microbiota community structure. In turn, the gut microbial community can modulate bile acid pools, thus highlighting the interconnectedness of the gut microbiota-bile acid-host axis. Despite these interactions, it remains unclear if and how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the gut microbial community structure and bile acid pool. This study aims to characterize how ursodiol alters the gastrointestinal ecosystem in conventional mice. C57BL/6J wildtype mice were given one of three doses of ursodiol (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 21 days. Alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acids were examined including stool, ileal, and cecal content. Bile acids were also measured in serum. Significant weight loss was seen in mice treated with the low and high dose of ursodiol. Alterations in the microbial community structure and bile acid pool were seen in ileal and cecal content compared to pretreatment, and longitudinally in feces following the 21-day ursodiol treatment. In both ileal and cecal content, members of the Lachnospiraceae family significantly contributed to the changes observed. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the gastrointestinal ecosystem. Further studies to investigate how these changes in turn modify the host physiologic response are important.\\n\\nImportanceUrsodeoxycholic acid (commercially available as ursodiol) is used to treat a variety of hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases.

    "abstract": "Xylella fastidiosa is an insect-borne bacterium confined to the xylem vessels of plants. This plant pathogen has a broad host range estimated to 560 plant species. Five subspecies of the pathogen with different but overlapping host ranges have been described, but only three subspecies are widely accepted, namely subspecies fastidiosa, multiplex and pauca. Initially limited to the Americas, Xf has been detected in Europe since 2013. As management of X. fastidiosa outbreaks in Europe depends on the identification of the subspecies, accurate determination of the subspecies in infected plants as early as possible is of major interest. Thus, we developed various tetraplex and triplex qPCR assays for Xylella fastidiosa detection and subspecies identification in planta in a single reaction. We designed primers and probes using SkIf, a bioinformatics tool based on k-mers, to detect specific signatures of the species and subspecies from a dataset of 58 genome sequences representative of X. fastidiosa diversity. We tested the qPCR assays on 39 target and 30 non-target strains, as well as on 13 different plant species spiked with strains of the different subspecies of X. fastidiosa, and on samples from various environmental and inoculated host plants. Sensitivity of simplex assays was equal or slightly better than the reference protocol on purified DNA. Tetraplex qPCR assays had the same sensitivity than the reference protocol and allowed X. fastidiosa detection in all spiked matrices up to 103 cells.mL-1. Moreover, mix infections of two to three subspecies could be detected in the same sample with tetraplex assays. In environmental plant samples, the tetraplex qPCR assays allowed subspecies identification when the current method based on multilocus sequence typing failed. The qPCR assays described here are robust and modular tools that are efficient for differentiating X. fastidiosa subspecies directly in plant samples.",

    "abstract": "A network of RNA helicases, endoribonucleases, and exoribonucleases regulates the quantity and quality of cellular RNAs. To date, mechanistic studies focused on bacterial and eukaryal systems due to the challenge of identifying the main drivers of RNA decay and processing in Archaea. Here, our data support that aRNase J, a 5-3 exoribonuclease of the {beta}-CASP family conserved in Euryarchaea, engages specifically with a Ski2-like helicase and the RNA exosome to potentially exert control over RNA surveillance, and that this occurs in the vicinity of the ribosome. Proteomic landscapes and direct protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated that aRNase J interplay with ASH-Ski2 and the Csl4 cap exosome subunit. These in vitro data are strengthened by our phylogenomic studies showing a taxonomic co-distribution of aRNase J and ASH-Ski2 among the archaeal phylogeny. Finally, our T. barophilus whole-cell extract fractionation experiments provide evidences that an aRNase J/ASH-Ski2 complex might exist in vivo and hint at an association of aRNase J with the ribosome or polysomes that is stressed in absence of ASH-Ski2. While aRNase J homologues are found among bacteria, the RNA exosome and the Ski2-like RNA helicase have eukaryotic homologues, underlining the mosaic aspect of archaeal RNA machines. Altogether, these results suggest, for the first time, a fundamental role of {beta}-CASP RNase/helicase complex in archaeal RNA metabolism. Finally, our results position aRNase J at the junction of RNA surveillance and translation processes, thus opening new perspectives and evolutionary scenario on RNA processing players in Archaea.",

In eukaryotes, polyprenols and dolichols are synthesized as a mixture of four or more homologues of different length with one or two predominant species with sizes varying among organisms. Polyprenols have been hardly detectable in eukaryotic cells under normal conditions with the exception of plants and sporulating yeast. Our metabolomics studies revealed that cis-polyisoprenoids are more prevalent and diverse in the parasite Plasmodium falciparum than previously postulated as we uncovered active de novo biosynthesis and substantial levels of accumulation of polyprenols and dolichols of 15 to 19 isoprene units. A distinctive polyprenol and dolichol profile both within the intraerythrocytic asexual cycle and between asexual and gametocyte stages was also observed suggesting that cis-polyisoprenoid biosynthesis changes throughout parasites development. In addition, we confirmed the presence of an active cis-prenyltransferase (PfCPT) and that dolichol biosynthesis occurs via reduction of the polyprenol to dolichol by an active polyprenol reductase (PfPPRD) in the malaria parasite. Isotopic labeling and metabolomic analyses of a conditional mutant of PfCPT or PfPPRD suggest that polyprenols may be able to substitute dolichols in their biological functions when dolichol synthesis is impaired in Plasmodium.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of chromosome conformation capture (3C-based) techniques as well as super-resolution imaging together with bioinformatics analyses has been fundamental for unveiling that chromosomes are organized into the so-called topologically associating domains or TADs. While these TADs appear as nested patterns in the 3C-based interaction matrices, the vast majority of available computational methods are based on the hypothesis that TADs are individual and unrelated chromatin structures. Here we introduce TADpole, a computational tool designed to identify and analyze the entire hierarchy of TADs in intra-chromosomal interaction matrices. TADpole combines principal component analysis and constrained hierarchical clustering to provide an unsupervised set of significant partitions in a genomic region of interest. TADpole identification of domains is robust to the data resolution, normalization strategy, and sequencing depth. TADpole domain borders are enriched in CTCF and cohesin binding proteins, while the domains are enriched in either H3K36me3 or H3k27me3 histone marks. We show TADpole usefulness by applying it to capture Hi-C experiments in wild-type and mutant mouse strains to pinpoint statistically significant differences in their topological structure.",

In this study, we present O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN, a method for integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) that detects active modules in cells of different transcriptional states. We achieve this by clustering RNA-sequencing data, identifying differentially expressed genes, constructing node-weighted PPINs, and finding the maximum-weight connected subgraphs with an exact Steiner-tree approach. As a case study, we investigate RNA-sequencing data from human liver spheroids but the techniques described here are applicable to other organisms and tissues. O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN allows us to expand the output of differential expressed genes analysis with information from protein interactions. We find that different transcriptional states have different subnetworks of the PPIN significantly enriched which represent biological pathways. In these pathways, O_SCPLOWSCC_SCPLOWPPIN also identifies proteins that are not differentially expressed but have a crucial biological function (e.g., as receptors) and therefore reveals biology beyond a standard differentially expressed gene analysis.",

    "abstract": "Impacts of genetic and non-genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) on tumor phenotypes and evolvability remain debated. We analyzed ITH in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) at the levels of genome, transcriptome, tumor-immune interactions, and histopathological characteristics by multi-region profiling and using single-cell sequencing data. Overall, in LUSC genomic heterogeneity alone was a weak indicator of intra-tumor non-genetic heterogeneity at immune and transcriptomic levels that impacted multiple cancer-related pathways including those related to proliferation and inflammation, which in turn contributed to intra-tumor regional differences in histopathology and subtype classification. Genome, transcriptome, and immune-level heterogeneity influenced different aspects of tumor evolution. Tumor subclones had substantial differences in proliferation score, suggestive of non-neutral clonal dynamics. Scores for proliferation and other cancer-related pathways also showed intra-tumor regional differences, sometimes even within the same subclones. Neo-epitope burden negatively correlated with immune infiltration, indicating potential immune-mediated purifying selection on acquired mutations in these tumors. Taken together, our observations suggest that non-genetic heterogeneity is a major determinant of heterogeneity in histopathological characteristics and impacts evolutionary dynamics in lung cancer.",

A crucial step was the development of forelimb flight feathers that may have evolved for courtship or territorial displays in ancestral theropod dinosaurs. Classical tissue recombination experiments performed in the chick embryo provide evidence that signals operating during early limb development specify the position and identity of feathers. Here we show that a positional information gradient of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling in the embryonic chick wing bud specifies the pattern of adult flight feathers in a defined spatial and temporal sequence that reflects their different identities. We reveal that the Shh signalling gradient is interpreted into specific patterns of flight feather-associated gene expression. Our data suggests that flight feather evolution involved the co-option of the pre-existing digit patterning mechanism and therefore uncovers an embryonic process that played a fundamental step in the evolution of avian flight.",

However, the relative contribution of migratory behavior to reproductive isolation is difficult to test. Comparing reproductive isolation in hybrid zones with and without migratory divides offers a rare opportunity to directly examine the contribution of divergent migratory behavior to reproductive barriers. We show that across replicate sampling transects of two pairs of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) subspecies, strong reproductive isolation coincided with an apparent migratory divide spanning 20 degrees of latitude. A third subspecies pair exhibited no evidence for a migratory divide and hybridized extensively. Within migratory divides, migratory phenotype was associated with assortative mating, implicating a central contribution of divergent migratory behavior to reproductive barriers. The remarkable geographic coincidence between migratory divides and genetic breaks supports a longstanding hypothesis that the Tibetan Plateau is a substantial barrier contributing to the diversity of Siberian avifauna.",

    "abstract": "Prochlorococcus grow in diurnal rhythms driven by diel cycles. Their ecology depends on light, nutrients, and top-down mortality processes including lysis by viruses. Cyanophage, viruses that infect cyanobacteria, are also impacted by light. For example, extracellular viability and intra-cell infection kinetics of some cyanophage vary between light and dark conditions. Nonetheless, it remains unclear if light-dependent viral life history traits scale-up to influence population-level dynamics. Here we examined the impact of diel-forcing on both cellular- and population-scale dynamics in multiple Prochlorococcus-phage systems. To do so, we developed a light-driven population model including both cellular growth and viral infection dynamics. We then tested the model against measurements of experimental infection dynamics with diel forcing to examine the extent to which population level changes in both viral and host abundances could be explained by light-dependent life history traits. Model-data integration reveals that light-dependent adsorption can improve fits to population dynamics for some virus-host pairs. However, light-dependent variation alone does not fully explain realized host and virus population dynamics. Instead, we show evidence of a previously unrecognized lysis saturation at relatively high virus to cell ratios. Altogether, our study represents a quantitative approach to integrate mechanistic models to reconcile Prochlorococcus-virus dynamics spanning cellular to population scales.",

Mistranslated protein is often misfolded and degraded or non-functional and results in an increased cost to quality control machinery. Despite these costs, errors during protein synthesis are common in bacteria. Here we report that increased rates of mistranslation in Escherichia coli provide protection from protein misfolding stress by increasing the level of the heat shock sigma factor, RpoH. Surprisingly, this increase in RpoH due to mistranslation is dependent on the presence of the general stress response sigma factor, RpoS.

    "abstract": "Vertebrate behavior is strongly influenced by light. Light receptors, encoded by functional Opsin proteins, are present inside the vertebrate brain and peripheral tissues. This expression feature is present from fishes to human and appears to be particularly prominent in diurnal vertebrates. Despite their conserved widespread occurrence, the non-visual functions of Opsins are still largely enigmatic. This is even more apparent when considering the high number of Opsins. Teleosts possess around 40 Opsin genes, present from young developmental stages to adulthood. Many of these Opsins have been shown to function as light receptors. This raises the question, if this large number might mainly reflect functional redundancy or rather maximally enables teleosts to optimally use the complex light information present under water. We focus on tmt-opsin1b and tmt-opsin2, c-Opsins with ancestral-type sequence features, conserved across several vertebrate phyla, expressed with partly similar expression in non-rod, non-cone, non-RGCs brain tissues and a similar spectral sensitivity. The characterization of the single mutants revealed age- and light-dependent behavioral changes, as well as an impact on the levels of the preprohormone sst1b and the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit scn12aa. The amount of day-time rest is affected independently of eyes, pineal and the circadian clock in tmt-opsin1b mutants. We further focused on day-time behavior and the molecular changes in tmt-opsin1b/2 double mutants, and revealed that - despite their similar expression and spectral features- these Opsins interact in part non-additively. Specifically, double mutants complement molecular and (age-dependently) behavioral phenotypes observed in single mutants.Our work provides a starting point to disentangle the highly complex interactions of vertebrate non-visual Opsins, suggesting that tmt-opsin-expressing cells together with other visual and non-visual Opsins provide detailed light information to the organism for behavioral fine-tuning. This work also provides a stepping stone to unravel how vertebrate species with conserved Opsins, but in different ecological niches respond to similar light cues and how human generated artificial light might impact on behavioral processes in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "Deposits of abnormal tau protein inclusions in the brain are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD), and are the best predictor of neuronal loss and clinical decline, but have been limited to postmortem assessment. Imaging-based biomarkers to detect tau deposits in vivo could leverage AD diagnosis and monitoring beginning in pre-symptomatic disease stages. Several PET tau tracers are available for research studies, but validation of such tracers against direct detection of tau deposits in brain tissue remains incomplete because of methodological limitations. Confirmation of the biological basis of PET binding requires large-scale voxel-to-voxel correlation has been challenging because of the dimensionality of the whole human brain histology data, deformation caused by tissue processing that precludes registration, and the need to process terabytes of information to cover the whole human brain volume at microscopic resolution. In this study, we created a computational pipeline for segmenting tau inclusions in billion-pixel digital pathology images of whole human brains, aiming at generating quantitative, tridimensional tau density maps that can be used to decipher the distribution of tau inclusions along AD progression and validate PET tau tracers. Our pipeline comprises several pre- and post-processing steps developed to handle the high complexity of these brain digital pathology images. SlideNet, a convolutional neural network designed to process our large datasets to locate and segment tau inclusions, is at the core of the pipeline. Using our novel method, we have successfully processed over 500 slides from two whole human brains, immunostained for two phospho-tau antibodies (AT100 and AT8) spanning several Gigabytes of images. Our artificial neural network estimated strong tau inclusion from image segmentation, which performs with ROC AUC of 0.89 and 0.85 for AT100 and AT8, respectively. Introspection studies further assessed the ability of our trained model to learn tau-related features. Furthermore, our pipeline successfully created 3D tau inclusion density maps that were co-registered to the histology 3D maps.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue-target associations, and subsequently were scanned using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the learned or not-learned time intervals. When temporal expectations were not met during testing trials, activity in hippocampal subfields CA3/CA2 and CA1 decreased while right putamen activity increased, compared to when temporal expectations were met. Further, psycho-physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left CA1 and caudate, as well as between putamen and caudate, decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations, with different but complementary contributions from caudate and putamen. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal-striatal network in temporal associative processing.",

Historically, CHIKV circulated as at least four lineages worldwide with both enzootic and epidemic transmission cycles. To understand the recent patterns of emergence and the current status of the CHIKV spread, updated analyses of the viral genetic data and metadata are needed. Here, we performed phylogenetic and comparative genomics screens of CHIKV genomes, taking advantage of the public availability of many recently sequenced isolates. Based on these new data and analyses, we derive a revised phylogeny from nucleotide sequences in coding regions. Using this phylogeny, we uncover the presence of several distinct lineages in Africa that were previously considered a single one. In parallel, we performed thermodynamic modeling of CHIKV untranslated regions (UTRs), which revealed evolutionarily conserved structured and unstructured RNA elements in the 3UTR. We provide evidence for duplication events in recently emerged American isolates of the Asian CHIKV lineage and propose the existence of a flexible 3UTR architecture among different CHIKV lineages.",

Here, we find that for RAS and six oncogene families, the most prevalent mutated members in cancer have a codon usage characteristic of genes involved in proliferation. The codon usage of KRAS is more adapted to be efficiently translated in proliferative cells than the codon usage of HRAS. We also show that the translation efficiency of KRAS varies between cell lines in a manner related to their tRNA expression.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide enrichment (eCO2) can enhance plant carbon uptake and growth1,2,3,4,5, thereby providing an important negative feedback to climate change by slowing the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration6. While evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong CO2 fertilization effect on biomass growth3,4,5, it is unclear whether mature forests respond to eCO2 in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands7,8,9,10, photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO2 without any apparent accompanying growth response, leaving an open question about the fate of additional carbon fixed under eCO24, 5, 7,8,9,10,11. Here, using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest responds to four years of eCO2 exposure. We show that, although the eCO2 treatment of ambient +150 ppm (+38%) induced a 12% (+247 gCm-2yr-1) increase in carbon uptake through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, with increased soil respiration alone contributing [~]50% of the total uptake surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO2, and challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on CO2 fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in standing forests and afforestation projects.",

Currently, insect traits are measured using collected specimens; the process of collection and maintenance of specimens can impose a heavy and unnecessary cost when such specimens themselves are not needed for the study.\\nC_LIO_LIWe propose a rapid, simple, accurate, and semi-automated method for high-throughput morphometric measurements of phototropic insects from shape and size calibrated digital images without having to collect a specimen. The method only requires inexpensive, off-the-shelf, consumer equipment and freely available programming (R) and image processing (ImageMagick) tools.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method using a data set of 3675 images of free-ranging hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) attracted to a light screen. Comparison of trait values from a subset of these images with direct measurements of specimens using a scale showed a high degree of correspondence. We have also identified several error metrics which help in assessing the method in an objective manner.\\nC_LIO_LIAlthough this method was developed for nocturnal phototropic insects, it can be used for any other (small) animal that can be imaged on a simple graph paper. While this technique will be generally useful for a variety of studies of insect traits, we suggest that it is particularly suited as a commensal on multi-epoch and multi-location population monitoring of insects in the context of climate and land-use change, where repeated sampling obviates the necessity of collecting specimen every time. It will help in accumulating a large amount of reliable trait data on hundreds of thousands of individual insects without an overwhelming expenditure on collection, handling, and maintenance of specimens.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The chronological lifespan of budding yeast is a model of aging and age-related diseases. This paradigm has recently allowed genome-wide screening of genetic factors underlying post-mitotic viability in a simple unicellular system, which underscores its potential to provide a comprehensive view of the aging process. However, results from different large-scale studies show little overlap and typically lack quantitative resolution to derive interactions among different aging factors. We previously introduced a sensitive, parallelizable approach to measure the chronological-lifespan effects of gene deletions based on the competitive aging of fluorescence-labeled strains. Here, we present a thorough description of the method, including an improved multiple-regression model to estimate the association between death rates and fluorescent signals, which accounts for possible differences in growth rate and experimental batch effects. We illustrate the experimental procedure--from data acquisition to calculation of relative survivorship--for ten deletion strains with known lifespan phenotypes, which is achieved with high technical replicability. We apply our method to screen for gene-drug interactions in an array of yeast deletion strains, which reveals a functional link between protein glycosylation and lifespan extension by metformin. Competitive-aging screening coupled to multiple-regression modeling provides a powerful, straight-forward way to identify aging factors in yeast and their interactions with pharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that acetylcholine mediates uncertainty-seeking behaviors through its projection to dopamine neurons - another neuromodulatory system known for its major implication in reinforcement learning and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a leaky-integrate-and-fire model of this mechanism. It implements a softmax-like selection with an uncertainty bonus by a cholinergic drive to dopaminergic neurons, which in turn influence synaptic currents of downstream neurons. The model is able to reproduce experimental data in two decision-making tasks. It also predicts that i) in the absence of cholinergic input, dopaminergic activity would not correlate with uncertainty, and that ii) the adaptive advantage brought by the implemented uncertainty-seeking mechanism is most useful when sources of reward are not highly uncertain. Moreover, this modeling work allows us to propose novel experiments which might shed new light on the role of acetylcholine in both random and directed exploration. Overall, this study thus contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of the cholinergic system and its involvement in decision-making in particular.",

    "abstract": "Jellyfish nerve nets provide insight into the origins of nervous systems, as both their taxonomic position and their evolutionary age imply that jellyfish resemble some of the earliest neuron-bearing, actively-swimming animals. Here we develop the first neuronal network model for the nerve nets of jellyfish. Specifically, we focus on the moon jelly Aurelia aurita and the control of its energy-eZcient swimming motion. The proposed single neuron model disentangles the contributions of different currents to a spike. The network model identifies factors ensuring non-pathological activity and suggests an optimization for the transmission of signals. After modeling the jellyfishs muscle system and its bell in a hydrodynamic environment, we explore the swimming elicited by neural activity. We find that different delays between nerve net activations lead to well-controlled, differently directed movements. Our model bridges the scales from single neurons to behavior, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of jellyfish neural control.",

The unique mechanics of motorized split-belt walking that constrains two limbs to move at different speeds during double support may limit transfer of step length adaptations to new walking contexts.\\n\\nResearch questionHow do spatial and temporal locomotor outputs contribute to transfer of step length adaptation from constrained motorized split-belt walking to unconstrained non-motorized split-belt walking?\\n\\nMethodsWe built a non-motorized split-belt treadmill that allows the user to walk at their own pace while simultaneously allowing the two belts to be self-propelled at different speeds. 10 healthy young participants walked on the non-motorized split-belt treadmill after an initial 10-minute adaptation on the motorized split-belt with a 2:1 speed ratio. Foot placement relative to the body and timing between heel strikes were calculated to determine spatial and temporal motor outputs, respectively. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs were used for step length difference and its spatial and temporal components to assess for transfer to the non-motorized treadmill.\\n\\nResultsWe found robust after-effects in step length difference during transfer to non-motorized split-belt treadmill walking that were primarily driven by changes in temporal motor outputs. Conversely, residual after-effects observed during motorized tied-belt treadmill walking (post-transfer) were driven by changes in spatial motor outputs.\\n\\nSignificanceOur data showed decoupling of adapted spatial and temporal locomotor outputs during the transfer to non-motorized split-belt walking, raising the new possibility of using a non-motorized split-belt treadmill to target specific spatial or temporal gait deficits.",

We wirelessly recorded place cells in rats as they explored a cubic lattice climbing frame which could be aligned or tilted with respect to gravity. Place cells represented the entire volume of the mazes: their activity tended to be aligned with the maze axes, and when it was more difficult for the animals to move vertically the cells represented space less accurately and less stably.

Here, we report that LRRK2 controls peripheral macrophages and brain-resident glial cells ability to respond to and express inflammatory molecules. LRRK2 KO macrophages express elevated basal levels of type I interferons, resulting from defective purine metabolism, mitochondrial damage, and engagement of mitochondrial DNA with the cGAS DNA sensing pathway. While LRRK2 KO mice can control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, they exhibit exacerbated lung inflammation and altered activation of glial cells in PD-relevant regions of the brain. These results directly implicate LRRK2 in peripheral immunity and support the \\\"multiple-hit hypothesis\\\" of neurodegenerative disease, whereby infection coupled with genetic defects in LRRK2 create an immune milieu that alters activation of glial cells and may trigger PD.",

We previously showed that not all Mtb-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, an important question is what proportion of T cells elicited by Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We answer this question by developing a modified elispot assay using viable Mtb-infected macrophages, a low multiplicity of infection and purified T cells. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 and CD8 T cells were classically MHC restricted. Comparable frequencies of T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages were determined using interferon-{gamma} elispot and intracellular cytokine staining, and lung CD4 T cells more sensitively recognized Mtb-infected macrophages than lung CD8 T cells. Compared to the numbers of Mtb antigen-specific T cells for antigens such as ESAT-6 and TB10.4, low frequencies of pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cells elicited by aerosolized Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that BCG vaccination elicits T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We propose that the frequency of T cells that recognize infected macrophages could correlate with protective immunity and may be an alternative approach to measuring T cell responses to Mtb antigens.",

Harwich (Har) strains with P-elements cause severe GD in F1 daughters when Har fathers mate with mothers lacking P-element-piRNAs (i.e. ISO1 strain). To address the mystery of why Har induces severe GD, we bred hybrid Drosophila with Har genomic fragments into the ISO1 background to create HISR-D or HISR-N lines that still cause Dysgenesis or are Non-dysgenic, respectively. In these lines, we discovered a highly truncated P-element variant we named \\\"Har-P\\\" as the most frequent de novo insertion. Although HISR-D lines still contain full-length P-elements, HISR-N lines lost functional P-transposase but retained Har-Ps that when crossed back to P-transposase restores GD induction. Finally, we uncovered P-element-piRNA-directed repression on Har-Ps transmitted paternally to suppress somatic transposition. The Drosophila short Har-Ps and full-length P-elements relationship parallels the MITEs/DNA-transposase in plants and SINEs/LINEs in mammals.",

Recent PET studies have demonstrated increased dopamine release in the striatum after prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We sought to extend this work by examining whether prefrontal tDCS could demonstrate an effect on behavioral and physiological correlates of subcortical dopamine activity. We conducted a between-subjects study (n = 30) with active and sham tDCS and used spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR), facial attractiveness ratings, and greyscales orienting bias as indirect proxies for dopamine functioning. The initial design and analyses were pre-registered (https://osf.io/gmnpc). Stimulation did not significantly affect any of the three measures, though effect sizes were often moderately large and were all in the predicted directions. Additional exploratory analyses suggested that stimulations effect on EBR might depend on pre-stimulation dopamine levels. Our results shed light on the sensitivity of indirect measures of dopamine in humans and add to a growing body of work demonstrating the importance of examining individual differences in tDCS response.",

The fundamental difficulty stems from the fact that RNA transcripts are long, while RNA-Seq reads are short. Here we use simulated benchmarking data that reflects many properties of real data, including polymorphisms, intron signal and non-uniform coverage, allowing for systematic comparative analyses of isoform quantification accuracy and its impact on differential expression analysis. Genome, transcriptome and pseudo alignment-based methods are included; and a simple approach is included as a baseline control. Salmon, kallisto, RSEM, and Cufflinks exhibit the highest accuracy on idealized data, while on more realistic data they do not perform dramatically better than the simple approach. We determine the structural parameters with the greatest impact on quantification accuracy to be length and sequence compression complexity and not so much the number of isoforms. The effect of incomplete annotation on performance is also investigated. Overall, the tested methods show sufficient divergence from the truth to suggest that full-length isoform quantification and isoform level DE should still be employed selectively.",

We consider weighting approaches that reward cross-study replicability within the training set. We find that incorporating multiple layers of ensembling in the training process increases the robustness of the resulting predictor. Furthermore, we explore the mechanisms by which the ensembling weights correspond to the internal structure of trees to shed light on the important features in determining the relationship between the Random Forests algorithm and the true outcome model.

    "abstract": "Correct reprogramming of epigenetic marks in the donor nuclei is a prerequisite for successful cloning by somatic cell transfer. In several mammalian species, repressive histone (H) lysine (K) trimethylation (me3) marks, in particular H3K9me3, form a major barrier to somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotency and totipotency. We engineered bovine embryonic fibroblasts for the doxycycline-inducible expression of Kdm4b, a demethylase that removes histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K36me3 marks. Upon inducing Kdm4b, H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels reduced [~]3-fold and [~]5-fold, respectively, compared to non-induced controls. Donor cell quiescence has been previously associated with reduced somatic trimethylation levels and increased cloning efficiency in cattle. Simultaneously inducing Kdm4b expression (via doxycycline) and quiescence (via serum starvation), further reduced global H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels by a total of 18-fold and 35-fold, respectively, compared to non-induced, non-starved control fibroblasts. Following somatic cell transfer, Kdm4b-BEF fibroblasts reprogrammed significantly better into cloned blastocysts than non-induced donor cells. However, detrimethylated donors and sustained Kdm4b-induction during embryo culture did not increase rates of post-blastocyst development from implantation to survival into adulthood. In summary, KDM4B only improved somatic cell reprogramming into early preimplantation stages, highlighting the need for alternative experimental approaches to reliably improve somatic cloning efficiency in cattle.",

    "abstract": "Reticuloendotheliosis retroviruses (REV) are known to cause immunosuppressive and oncogenic disease that affects numerous avian species. REV is present worldwide and recently has been reported in South America with cases of infected commercial flocks in Argentina. We surveyed for the presence of REV in birds from a state in the northern region of Brazil using real-time PCR. We report the first cases of REV in Brazil, detected in Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata), wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), and chickens (Gallus gallus) at a relatively high prevalence rate (16,8%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close relationship of this strain to variants in the United States. This study provides evidence of REV in the Amazon biome and provides a baseline for future surveillance of the virus in the region and throughout Brazil.",

In this paper it is shown that it is possible to make a mathematical model not only of mutations on the genome of species, but of evolution itself, including factors such as artificial and natural selection. It is also presented the algorithm to obtain the probabilities of mutation for each specific part of the genome and for each specie.\\n\\nEven more, it is presented a mathematical method to estimate the amount of generations between two related genomes and a function capable of predict the amount of mutations through time a genome will suffer.\\n\\nThe potential of having this tool is giantic going from genetic engineering applied to medicine to filling up blank spaces in phylogenetic studies or preservation of endangered species due to genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGill health is one of the main concerns for Atlantic salmon aquaculture, and Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD), attributable to infection by the amoeba Neoparamoeba perurans, is a frequent cause of morbidity. In the absence of preventive measures, increasing genetic resistance of salmon to AGD via selective breeding can reduce the incidence of the disease and mitigate gill damage. Understanding the mechanisms leading to AGD resistance and the underlying causative genomic features can aid in this effort, while also providing critical information for the development of other control strategies. AGD resistance is considered to be moderately heritable, and several putative QTL have been identified. The aim of the current study was to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying AGD resistance, and to identify putative causative genomic factors underlying the QTL. To achieve this, RNA was extracted from the gill and head kidney of AGD resistant and susceptible animals following a challenge with N. perurans, and sequenced.\\n\\nResultsComparison between resistant and susceptible animals pointed to differences mainly in the local immune response in the gill, involving red blood cell genes and genes related to immune function and cell adhesion. Differentially expressed immune genes highlighted differences in the Th2 and Th17 responses, which are consistent with the increased heritability observed after successive challenges with the amoeba. Five QTL-region candidate genes showed differential expression, including a gene connected to interferon responses (GVINP1), a gene involved in systemic inflammation (MAP4K4), and a positive regulator of apoptosis (TRIM39). Analyses of allele-specific expression highlighted a gene in the QTL region on chromosome 17, cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG1), showing allelic differential expression suggestive of a cis-acting regulatory variant.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of resistance to AGD in Atlantic salmon, and highlights candidate genes for further functional studies that can further elucidate the genomic mechanisms leading to resistance and contribute to enhancing salmon health via improved genomic selection.",

Nm affects RNA structure and function with crucial roles in various RNA-mediated processes ranging from RNA silencing, translation, self versus non-self recognition to viral defense mechanisms. Here, we identify two novel Nm methyltransferases (Nm-MTases) in Drosophila melanogaster (CG7009 and CG5220) as functional orthologs of yeast TRM7 and human FTSJ1, respectively. Genetic knockout studies together with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and RiboMethSeq mapping revealed that CG7009 is responsible for methylating the wobble position in tRNAPhe, tRNATrp and tRNALeu, while subsequently, CG5220 methylates position C32 in the same tRNAs and targets also additional tRNAs. CG7009 or CG5220 mutant animals were viable and fertile but exhibited various phenotypes such as life span reduction, small RNA pathways dysfunction and increased sensitivity to RNA virus infections. Our results provide the first detailed characterization of two TRM7 family members in Drosophila and uncover a molecular link between enzymes catalysing Nm at specific tRNAs and small RNA-induced gene silencing pathways.",

    "abstract": "The axolotl (Ambystoma Mexicanum) salamander, an urodele amphibian, has an exceptional regenerative capacity to fully restore an amputated limb throughout the life-long lasting neoteny. By contrast, when axolotls are experimentally induced to metamorphosis, attenuation of the limbs regenerative competence is noticeable. Here, we sought to discern the proteomic profiles of the early stages of blastema formation of neotenic and metamorphic axolotls after limb amputation by means of LC-MS/MS technology. We quantified a total of 714 proteins having an adjusted p < 0.01 with FC greater or equal to 2 between two conditions. Principal component analysis revealed a conspicuous clustering between neotenic and metamorphic samples at 7 days post-amputation. Different set of proteins was identified as differentially expressed at all of the time points (1, 4, and 7 days post-amputations against day0) for neotenic and metamorphic stages. Although functional enrichment analyses underline the presence of common pathways between regenerative and nonregenerative stages, cell proliferation and its regulation associated pathways, immune system related pathways and muscle tissue and ECM remodeling and degradation pathways were represented at different rate between both stages. To validate the proteomics results and provide evidence for the putative link between immune system activity and regenerative potential, qRT-PCR for selected genes was performed.",

Two isoforms of Neat1, the short isoform Neat1_1 and the long isoform Neat1_2, are generated from the same gene locus by alternative 3 processing. Neat1_1 is the most abundant and the best conserved isoform expressed in various cell types, whereas Neat1_2 is expressed in a small population of particular cell types, including the tip cells of the intestinal epithelium. To investigate the physiological significance of isoform switching, we created mutant mice that solely expressed Neat1_2 by deleting the upstream polyadenylation (poly-A) signal (PAS) required for the production of Neat1_1. We observed the loss of Neat1_1 and strong upregulation of Neat1_2 in various tissues and cells and the subsequent hyperformation of paraspeckles, especially in cells that normally express Neat1_2. However, the mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit obvious external and histological abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Dispersal is essential for terrestrial organisms living in disjunct habitats and constitutes a significant challenge for the evolution of wingless taxa. Springtails (Collembola), the sister-group of all insects (with dipluran), are reported since the Lower Devonian and thought to have originally been subterranean. The order Symphypleona is reported since the early Cretaceous with genera distributed on every continent, implying an ability to disperse over oceans although never reported in marine water contrary to other springtail orders. Despite being highly widespread, modern springtails are generally rarely reported in any kind of biotic association. Interestingly, the fossil record has provided occasional occurrences of Symphypleona attached by the antennae onto the bodies of larger arthropods. Here, we document the case of a ~16 Ma old fossil association: a winged termite and ant displaying not some, but 25 springtails attached or closely connected to the body. The collembola exhibit rare features for fossils, reflecting their courtship and phoretic behaviors. By observing the modes of attachment of springtails on different arthropods, the sex representation and ratios in springtail antennal anatomies in new and previously reported cases, we infer a likely mechanism for dispersal in Symphypleona. By revealing hidden evidence of modern springtail associations with other invertebrates such as ants and termites, new compelling assemblages of fossil springtails and the drastic increase of eusocial insects\u2019 abundance over Cenozoic (ants/termites comprising more than the third of insects in Miocene amber), we stress that attachment with winged casts of ants and termites may have been a mechanism for the worldwide dispersal of this significant springtail lineage. Moreover, by comparing the general constraints applying to the other wingless soil-dwelling arthropods known to disperse through phoresy, we suggest biases in the collection and observation of phoretic Symphypleona related to their reflexive detachment and infer that this behavior continues today. The specific case of tree resin entrapment represents the (so far) only condition uncovering the actual dispersal mechanism of springtails - one of the oldest terrestrial arthropod lineages living today. Associations with soil-dwelling social insects over time would have been at the origin of this behavioural specialization.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The beta-cell protein synthetic machinery is dedicated to the production of insulin, which plays a critical role in organismal homeostasis. Insulin synthesis requires the proper folding and trafficking of its precursor, proinsulin, yet the precise network of proinsulin protein interactions in the secretory pathway remains poorly defined. In the present study we conducted unbiased profiling of the proinsulin interactome in human islets, utilizing a human proinsulin-specific monoclonal antibody for affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Stringent analysis identified a central node of interactions between human proinsulin and sequential secretory pathway proteins that is remarkably conserved across 3 ethnicities and both genders. Among the most prominent proinsulin interactions was with ER-localized peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4). A functional role for PRDX4 in beta-cells was demonstrated by gene silencing that rendered proinsulin susceptible to misfolding, particularly in response to oxidative stress. Conversely, exogenous PRDX4 improved proinsulin folding. Notably, oxidative stress and even high glucose treatment alone induced proinsulin misfolding in human islets and MIN6 cells, and this was accompanied by sulfonylation of PRDX4, a modification known to inactivate peroxiredoxins. This finding prompted PRDX4 analysis in a panel of human islet samples that revealed significantly higher levels of sulfonylated (inactive) PRDX4 in islets from patients with T2D compared to that of healthy individuals. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of elucidating the complete proinsulin interactome in human islets in order to understand critical steps controlling insulin biosynthesis, beta cell function, and T2D.",

The present functional neuroimaging study seeks to define the basic roles of these VLF-DMF network regions in primate vocal production and how they might have been adapted for human speech. We demonstrate that area 44 and the MCC are respectively involved in the cognitive selection of orofacial, non-speech vocal and verbal responses, and the feedback-driven adaptation of these responses - roles that are likely preserved across primates. In contrast, area 45 and preSMA have roles that are specific to human speech: area 45 contributes to active verbal retrieval during learning, while preSMA is involved in processing verbal feedback during orofacial/vocal adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Presence of ultra-conserved sequence elements in vertebrate enhancers suggest that transcription factor regulatory interactions are shared across phylogenetically diverse species. To date evidence for similarly conserved elements among evolutionarily distant insects such as flies, mosquitos, ants and bees, has been elusive. This study has taken advantage of the availability of the assembled genomic sequence of these insects to explore the presence of ultraconserved sequence elements in these phylogenetic groups. To investigate the integrity of fly regulatory sequences across ~100 million years of evolutionary divergence from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, we compared Drosophila non-coding sequences to those of Ceratitis capitata, the Mediterranean fruit fly and Musca domestica, the domestic housefly. Using various alignment techniques, Blastn, Clustal, Blat, EvoPrinter and Needle, we show that many of the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) that constitute Drosophila cis-regulatory DNA, recognized by EvoPrinter alignment protocols, are also conserved in Ceratitis and Musca. We term the sequence elements shared among these species ultraconserved CSBs (uCSBs). The position of the uCSBs with respect to flanking genes is also conserved. The results suggest that CSBs represent the point of interaction of multiple trans-regulators whose functions and interactions are conserved across divergent genera. Blastn alignments also detect putative cis-regulatory sequences shared among evolutionarily distant mosquitos Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens and Aedes aegypti. We have also identified conserved sequences shared among bee species. Side by side comparison of bee and ant EvoPrints identify uCSBs shared between the two taxa, as well as more poorly conserved CSBs in either one or the other taxon but not in both. Analysis of uCSBs in dipterans, mosquitos and bees will lead to a greater understanding of their evolutionary origin and the function of their conserved sequences.",

In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing, and exhibits a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude decrease in false positive rates compared to lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies.\n\nConclusionsOur real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (a) recover highly correlated predictors, (b) avoid over-fitting, (c) deliver better true positive and false positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (d) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (e) exploit prior information and group-sparsity and (f) be used with biobank sized data sets. Although these advances are studied for GWAS inference, our extensions are pertinent to other regression problems with large numbers of predictors.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus in the world and a major cause of morbidity in the tropics and subtropics. Upregulation of HLA class I molecules has long been considered a feature of DENV infection, yet this has not been evaluated in the setting of natural infection. Natural killer (NK) cells, an innate immune cell subset critical for mounting an early response to viral infection, are inhibited by self HLA class I, suggesting that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection could dampen the NK cell response. Here we addressed whether upregulation of HLA class I molecules occurs during in vivo DENV infection and, if so, whether this suppresses the NK cell response. We found that HLA class I expression was indeed upregulated during acute DENV infection across multiple cell lineages in vivo. To better understand the role of HLA class I upregulation, we infected primary human monocytes, a major target of DENV infection, in vitro. Upregulation of total HLA class I is dependent on active viral replication and is mediated in part by cytokines and other soluble factors induced by infection, while upregulation of HLA-E occurs in the presence of replication-incompetent virus. Importantly, blocking DENV-infected monocytes with a pan-HLA class I Fab nearly doubles the frequency of degranulating NK cells, while blocking HLA-E does not significantly improve the NK cell response. These findings demonstrate that upregulation of HLA class I during DENV infection suppresses the NK cell response, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis.",

However, acquisition of resistance by bacteria is a major issue in the successful development of phage therapies. Through natural evolution and structural modeling, we identified host-range determining regions (HRDR) in the T3 phage tail fiber protein and developed a high-throughput strategy to genetically engineer these regions through site-directed mutagenesis.

    "abstract": "DNA Gyrase is an essential enzyme involved in the homeostatic control of DNA supercoiling and the target of successful antibacterial compounds. Despite extensive studies, the detailed architecture of DNA Gyrase from the model genetic organism E. coli, is still missing, impeding structure-function analysis of E. coli-specific catalytic regulation and limiting the study of conformational intermediates of this highly flexible macromolecule. Herein, we determined the complete molecular structure of the E. coli DNA Gyrase bound to a 180 bp DNA and the antibiotic Gepotidacin, using phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our data unveil with unprecedented details the structural and spatial organization of the functional domains, their connections and the position of the conserved GyrA-box motif. The deconvolution of closed and pre-opening states of the DNA-binding domain provides a better understanding of the allosteric movements of the enzyme complex. In this region, the local atomic resolution reaching up to 3.0 [A] enables the identification of the antibiotic density in the DNA complex. Altogether, this study paves the way for the cryo-EM determination of gyrase complexes with antibiotics and opens perspectives for targeting conformational intermediates. The type 2A DNA topoisomerases (Top2) are nanomachines that control DNA topology during multiple cellular processes such as replication, transcription and cell division 1-4. These enzymes catalyze the transport of a DNA duplex through a double strand break to perform DNA relaxation, decatenation and unknotting. DNA Gyrase plays a vital role in the compaction of the bacterial genome and is the sole type 2 topoisomerase able to introduce negative supercoils into DNA, a reaction coupled to ATP hydrolysis 5.",

    "abstract": "Inference of active regulatory mechanisms underlying specific molecular and environmental perturbations is essential for understanding cellular response. The success of inference algorithms relies on the quality and coverage of the underlying network of regulator-gene interactions. Several commercial platforms provide large and manually-curated regulatory networks and functionality to perform inference on these networks. Adaptation of such platforms for open-source academic applications has been hindered by the lack of availability of accurate, high-coverage networks of regulatory interactions and integration of efficient causal inference algorithms. In this work, we present CIE, an integrated platform for causal inference of active regulatory mechanisms form differential gene expression data. Using a regularized Gaussian Graphical Model, we construct a transcriptional regulatory network by integrating publicly available ChIP-Seq experiments with gene-expression data from tissue-specific RNA-Seq experiments. Our GGM approach identifies high confidence TF-gene interactions and annotates the interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression). Benchmarks against manually-curated databases of TF-gene interactions show that our method can accurately detect mode of regulation. We demonstrate the ability of our platform to identify active transcriptional regulators by using controlled in vitro overexpression and stem-cell differentiation studies and utilize our method to investigate transcriptional mechanisms of fibroblast phenotypic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem of supervised learning algorithms for brain imaging applications is that the number of features far exceeds the number of subjects. In this paper, we propose a combined feature selection and extraction approach for multiclass problems. This method starts with a bagging procedure which calculates the sign consistency of the multivariate analysis (MVA) projection matrix feature-wise to determine the relevance of each feature. This relevance measure provides a parsimonious matrix, which is combined with a hypothesis test to automatically determine the number of selected features. Then, a novel MVA regularized with the sign and magnitude consistency of the features is used to generate a reduced set of summary components providing a compact data description.\\n\\nWe evaluated the proposed method with two multiclass brain imaging problems: 1) the classification of the elderly subjects in four classes (cognitively normal, stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI converting to AD in 3 years, and Alzheimers disease) based on structural brain imaging data from the ADNI cohort; 2) the classification of children in 3 classes (typically developing, and 2 types of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)) based on functional connectivity. Experimental results confirmed that each brain image (defined by 29.852 features in the ADNI database and 61.425 in the ADHD) could be represented with only 30 - 45% of the original features. Furthermore, this information could be redefined into two or three summary components, providing not only a gain of interpretability but also classification rate improvements when compared to state-of-art reference methods.",

This identified genes that showed evidence for colocalization and replication, with downstream functional validation being performed in isogenic HD stem cells and patient brains. Enrichment analyses detected associations with various biologically-relevant gene sets and striatal coexpression modules that are mediated by CAG length. Further, cortical coexpression modules that are relevant for HD onset were also associated with cognitive decline and HD-related traits in a longitudinal cohort. In summary, the combination of population-scale gene expression information with HD patient genomic data identified novel modifier genes for the disorder.",

It is composed of a helicase, a nuclease and a gene of unknown function here named trcg (for Target Repeat-Containing gene), which contains four 15-bp repeats identical to the Zamilon sequence. Their silencing restored susceptibility to Zamilon, and the CRISPR-Cas4-like activity of the nuclease was recently characterised. We expressed these 3 genes after transformation of a modified strain of Escherichia coli made resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The virophage repeats were replaced with four repeats of 15 nucleotides identical to a sequence in the tetracycline resistance gene. The induction of the MIMIVIRE genes restored E. coli sensitivity to tetracycline; the tetracycline operon and its supporting plasmid harbouring the chloramphenicol resistance gene vanished. We therefore efficiently transferred the defence system MIMIVIRE from giant Mimivirus against virophage to E. coli to clear it from a plasmid.",

    "abstract": "The human brain consists of functionally specialized areas, which flexibly interact and integrate forming a multitude of complex functional networks. However, the nature and governing principles of these specialized areas remain controversial: a distinct modular architecture versus a smooth continuum across the whole cortex. Here, we demonstrate a candidate governing principle ubiquitous in nature, that resolves this controversy for the brain at rest, during perception, cognition and action: functional harmonic modes. We calculated the harmonic modes of the brains functional connectivity, called \"functional harmonics\", from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in resting state of 812 participants. Each functional harmonic provides an elementary pattern of brain activity with a different spatial frequency. The set of all functional harmonics - ordered according to their spatial frequencies - can reconstruct any pattern of brain activity. The activity patterns elicited by 7 different tasks from the Human Connectome Project can be reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics, suggesting a novel relationship between task and resting state brain activity. Further, the isolines of the continuous functional harmonic patterns delineate the borders of specialized cortical areas as well as somatotopic and retinotopic organization. Our results demonstrate a candidate scalable governing principle for functional brain organization, resolving the controversy between modular versus gradiental views, and demonstrate that a universal principle in nature also underlies human brain cortical organization.",

    "abstract": "Lipid antigens are presented on the surface of cells by the CD1 family of glycoproteins, which have structural and functional similarity to MHC class I molecules. The hydrophobic lipid antigens are embedded in membranes and inaccessible to the lumenal lipid-binding domain of CD1 molecules. Therefore, CD1 molecules require lipid transfer proteins for lipid loading and editing. CD1d is loaded with lipids in late endocytic compartments, and lipid transfer proteins of the saposin family have been shown to play a crucial role in this process. However, the mechanism by which saposins facilitate lipid binding to CD1 molecules is not known and is thought to involve transient interactions between protein components to ensure CD1-lipid complexes can be efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane for antigen presentation. Of the four saposin proteins, the importance of Saposin B (SapB) for loading of CD1d is the most well-characterised. However, a direct interaction between CD1d and SapB has yet to be described. In order to determine how SapB might load lipids onto CD1d, we used purified, recombinant CD1d and SapB and carried out a series of highly sensitive binding assays to monitor direct interactions. Using equilibrium binding analysis, chemical cross-linking and co-crystallisation experiments, under a range of different conditions, we could not demonstrate a direct interaction. This work establishes comprehensively that the role of SapB in lipid loading does not involve direct binding to CD1d. We discuss the implication of this for our understanding of lipid loading of CD1d and propose several factors that may influence this process.",

    "abstract": "Forest ecosystems are increasingly challenged by extreme events, e.g. drought, storms, pest and pathogenic fungi outbreaks, causing severe ecological and economical losses. Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive traits in tree species is of key importance to preserve forest ecosystems, as genetic variation in a trait (i.e. heritability) determines its potential for human-mediated or evolutionary change. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), a conifer widely distributed in southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa, grows under contrasted environmental conditions promoting local adaptation. Genetic variation at adaptive phenotypes, including height, growth phenology and susceptibility to two fungal pathogens (Diplodia sapinea and Armillaria ostoyae) and an insect pest (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), were assessed in a range-wide clonal common garden of maritime pine. Broad-sense heritability was significant for height (0.219), growth phenology (0.165-0.310) and pathogen susceptibility (necrosis length caused by D. sapinea, 0.152; and by A. ostoyae, 0.021) measured after inoculation under controlled conditions, but not for pine processionary moth incidence in the common garden. The correlations of trait variation among populations revealed contrasting trends for pathogen susceptibility to D. sapinea and A. ostoyae with respect to height. Taller trees showed longer necrosis length caused by D. sapinea while shorter trees were more affected by A. ostoyae. Moreover, maritime pine populations from areas with high summer temperatures and frequent droughts were less susceptible to D. sapinea but more susceptible to A. ostoyae. Finally, an association study using 4,227 genome-wide SNPs revealed several loci significantly associated to each trait (range of 3-26), including a possibly disease-induced translation initiation factor, eIF-5. This study provides important insights to develop genetic conservation and breeding strategies integrating species responses to biotic stressors.",

However, mechanisms regulating their diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we show that conditional loss of the Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) gene, Tsc1, which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), causes a subset of SST+ CINs, to express PV and adopt fast-spiking (FS) properties, characteristic of PV+ CINs. These changes also occur when only one allele of Tsc1 is deleted, making these findings relevant to individuals with TS. Notably, treatment with rapamycin, which inhibits MTOR, reverses these changes in adult mice. These data reveal novel functions of MTOR signaling in regulating PV expression and FS properties, which may contribute to some neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in TS. Moreover, they suggest that CINs can exhibit properties intermediate between those classically associated with PV+ or SST+ CINs, which may be dynamically regulated by the MTOR signaling.",

Consistent anatomical features were used to delimit and parcellate brain regions in the macaque, which were then categorized according to functional systems. This system of parcellation will be expanded with advances in technology and like the HOA, will provide a framework upon which the results from other experimental studies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), physiology, connection, graph theory) can be interpreted.",

    "abstract": "Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) possess unique properties underlying the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), that are crucial for homeostatic brain functions and interactions with the immune system. Modulation of BBB function is essential for treatment of neurological diseases and effective tumor targeting. Studies to-date have been hampered by the lack of physiological models using cultivated human BMECs that sustain BBB properties. Recently, differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into cells with BBB-like properties has been reported, providing a robust in vitro model for drug screening and mechanistic understanding of neurological diseases. However, the precise identity of these iBMECs remains unclear. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and immunofluorescence for several pathways, transcription factors (TFs), and surface markers, we examined the molecular and functional properties of iBMECs differentiated either in the absence or presence of retinoic acid. We found that iBMECs lack both endothelial-lineage genes and ETS TFs that are essential for the establishment and maintenance of EC identity. Moreover, iBMECs fail to respond to angiogenic stimuli and form lumenized vessels in vivo. We demonstrate that human iBMECs are not barrier-forming ECs but rather EpCAM+ neuroectodermal epithelial cells (NE-EpiCs) that form tight junctions resembling those present in BBB-forming BMECs. Finally, overexpression of ETS TFs (ETV2, FLI1, and ERG) reprograms NE-EpiCs to become more like the BBB-forming ECs. Thus, although directed differentiation of human iBMECs primarily gives rise to epithelial cells, overexpression of several ETS TFs can divert them toward a vascular BBB in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte density and infections in mosquitoes is central to understanding the rates of transmission with important implications for control. Here, we determined whether field relevant variation in environmental temperature could also modulate this relationship. Anopheles stephensi were challenged with three densities of P. falciparum gametocytes spanning a [~]10-fold gradient, and housed under diurnal/daily temperature range (\\\"DTR\\\") of 9{degrees}C around means of 20{degrees}C, 24{degrees}C and 28{degrees}C. At the peak stages of infection for each temperature, the proportion of mosquitoes infected with oocysts in the midguts or infectious with sporozoites in the salivary glands were measured (referred to collectively as vector competence hereon), in addition to oocyst intensities from infected midguts. While vector competence was similar at 20 DTR 9{degrees}C and 24 DTR 9{degrees}C, the proportion of mosquitoes infected and subsequently infectious were also comparable, with evidence, surprisingly, for higher vector competence in mosquitoes challenged with intermediate gametocyte densities. For the same gametocyte densities however, severe reduction in the proportion of infectious mosquitoes was accompanied by a significant decline in vector competence at 28 DTR 9{degrees}C, although density per se showed a positive and linear effect at this temperature. Unlike vector competence, oocyst intensities decreased with increasing temperatures with a predominantly positive and linear association with gametocyte density, especially at 28 DTR 9{degrees}C. Oocyst intensities across individual infected midguts suggested temperature-specific differences in mosquito susceptibility/resistance: at 20 DTR 9{degrees}C and 24 DTR 9{degrees}C, dispersion (aggregation) increased in a density-dependent manner but not at 28 DTR 9{degrees}C where the distributions were consistently random. Limitations notwithstanding, our results have manifold implications in, for instance, how variation in temperature could modify seasonal dynamics of infectious reservoirs and transmission and the contribution of high-/patent- and low-density/sub-patent carriers, to suggestions for design and deployment of transmission-blocking vaccines/drugs, but with a cautionary note suggesting how low efficacy could lead to transmission enhancement in certain environments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProteasome is major protein degradation machinery and plays essential roles in diverse biological functions. Upon cytokine inductions, proteasome subunits {beta}1, {beta}2, and {beta}5 are replaced by {beta}1i/LMP2, {beta}2i/MECL-1, and {beta}5i/LMP7, leading to the formation of immunoproteasome. Immunoproteasome-degraded products are loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) to regulate immune responses and induce cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causal agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-1-specific CTLs represent critical immune responses to limit viral replication. HIV-1 negative regulatory factor (Nef) counteracts host immunity, especially the MHC-I/CTL. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which Nef facilitates immune evasion through attenuating the functions of immunoproteasome and MHC-I. Nef interacts with LMP7 on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to down-regulate the incorporation of LMP7 into immunoproteasome, and thereby attenuating immunoproteasome formation. Moreover, Nef represses immunoproteasome protein degradation function, MHC-I trafficking, and antigen presentation activity.\\n\\nImportanceUbiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is essential for degradation of damaged proteins, which takes place in proteasome. Upon cytokine inductions, proteasome catalytic activities are replaced by distinct isoforms resulting in formation of immunoproteasome. Immunoproteasome generates peptides for MHC-I antigen presentation and plays important roles in immune responses. HIV-1 is the agent of AIDS, and HIV-1-specific CTLs represent immune responses to limit viral replication. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which HIV-1 promotes immune evasion. Viral protein Nef interacts with immunoproteasome component LMP7 to attenuate immunoproteasome formation and protein degradation function, and repress MHC-I antigen presentation activity. Therefore, HIV-1 targets LMP7 to inhibit immunoproteasome activation and LMP7 may be used as a target for the development of anti-HIV-1/AIDS therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAltered brain activity that has been observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while performing cognitive control tasks like the stop signal task (SST), has generally been interpreted as reflecting either weak (under-active) or compensatory (over-active) versions of the same functions as in healthy controls. If so, then regional activities that correlate with the efficiency of inhibitory control (i.e. stop signal reaction time, SSRT) in healthy subjects should also correlate with SSRT in ADHD. Here we test the alternate hypothesis that BOLD differences might instead reflect the redirection of neural processing resources normally used for task-directed inhibitory control, toward actively managing symptomatic behavior. If so, then activities that correlate with SSRT in TD should instead correlate with inattentive and hyperactive symptoms in ADHD.\\n\\nMethodsWe used fMRI in 14 typically developing (TD) and 14 ADHD adolescents performing the SST, and in a replication sample of 14 healthy adults. First we identified significant group BOLD differences during all phases of activity in the SST (i.e. warning, response, reactive inhibition, error detection and post-error slowing). Next, we correlated these phases of activity with SSRT in TD, and with SSRT, inattentive and hyperactive symptom scores in ADHD. We then identified whole brain significant correlations in regions of significant group difference in activity.\\n\\nResultsOnly three regions of significant group difference were correlated with SSRT in TD and replication groups (left and right inferior frontal gyri (IFG) during error detection, and hypothalamus during post-error slowing). Consistent with regions of altered activity managing symptomatic behavior instead of task-directed behavior, left IFG correlated with greater inattentive score, right IFG correlated with lower hyperactive score, and hypothalamus correlated with greater inattentive score and oppositely correlated with SSRT compared to TD.\\n\\nConclusionsResults are consistent with stimuli that elicit task-directed integration of neural processing in healthy subjects, instead directing integrated function towards managing symptomatic behavior in ADHD. The ability of the current approach to determine whether altered neural activities reflect comparable functions in ADHD and control groups has broad implications for the development and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Tea, prepared from the young leaves of Camellia sinensis, is a non-alcoholic beverage globally consumed due to its antioxidant properties, strong taste and aroma. Although, the genomic data of this medicinally and commercially important plant is available, studies related to its sub-cellular interactomic maps are less explored. In this work, we propose a genome-wide interologous protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of tea, termed as TeaGPIN, consisting of 12,033 nodes and 216,107 interactions, developed using draft genome of tea and known PPIs exhaustively collected from 49 template plants. TeaGPIN interactions are prioritized using domain-domain interactions along with the interolog information. A high-confidence TeaGPIN consisting of 5,983 nodes and 58,867 edges is reported and its interactions are further evaluated using protein co-localization similarities. Based on three network centralities (degree, betweenness and eigenvector), 1,302 key proteins are reported in tea to have p-value < 0.01 by comparing the TeaGPIN with 10,000 realizations of Erd[o]s-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert based corresponding random network models. Functional content of TeaGPIN is assessed using KEGG and GO annotations and its modular architecture is explored. Network based characterization is carried-out on the transcription factors, and proteins involved flavonoid biosynthesis and photosynthesis pathways to find novel candidates involved in various regulatory processes. We believe the proposed TeaGPIN will impart useful insights in understanding various mechanisms related to growth and development as well as defence against biotic and abiotic perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomain binding of acetyl-lysine residues is a crucial step in many epigenetic mechanisms governing transcription. Nearly half of human bromodomains exist in tandem with at least one other bromodomain on a single protein. The Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal domain (BET) familyof proteins (BrdT, Brd2, Brd3 and Brd4) each encode two bromodomains at their N-termini and are important regulators of acetylation-dependent transcription in homeostasis and disease. Previous efforts have focused on identifying protein acetylation sites bound by individual bromodomains. However, the mechanisms through which tandem bromodomains act cooperatively on chromatin are largely unknown. Here, we first used small angle x-ray scattering combined with Rosetta ab initio modeling to explore conformational space available to BET tandem bromodomains. For Brd4, the flexible tandem bromodomain linker allows for distances between the two acetyl-lysine binding sites ranging from 15 to 157 [A]. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay, we show a clear distance dependence for Brd4 tandem bromodomain bivalent binding of multiply acetylated histone H4 peptides. However, isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed Brd4 binding affinity toward multiply acetylated peptides does not correlate with the potential for bivalent binding. We used sucrose gradient assays to provide direct evidence in vitro that Brd4 tandem bromodomains can simultaneously bind and scaffold multiple acetylated nucleosomes. Intriguingly, our bioinformatic analysis of deposited chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data indicates that Brd4 colocalizes with subsets of histone acetyl-lysine sites across transcriptionally active chromatin compartments. These findings support our hypothesis that scaffolding of acetylated nucleosomes by Brd4 tandem bromodomains contributes to higher-order chromatin architecture.",

Among this class of diagnostics, the use of pathogen genotype to predict AMR phenotype has been facilitated by advances in rapid sequencing platforms. A longstanding objection to this approach, however, is that the emergence of novel resistance mechanisms will inevitably lead to a decline in the sensitivity of these diagnostics. Here, we show that while the sensitivities of some genetic markers of resistance remain stably high, sensitivities of other markers rapidly decline, as expected, due to the emergence of novel resistance variants. We then present a simple mathematical framework that defines the sampling and phenotypic testing rates needed for early detection of novel resistance variants and thus demonstrate how surveillance can help maintain the sensitivity and utility of sequence-based AMR diagnostics.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryTargeted sampling strategies are necessary for early detection of novel resistance mechanisms and sustainability of genotype-based detection of novel resistance mechanisms and sustainability of genotype-based diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing momentum toward the development of gene therapy for heart failure (HF), cardiomyopathy, and other progressive cardiac diseases that correlate with impaired calcium (Ca2+) transport and reduced contractility. We have used FRET between fluorescently-tagged SERCA2a (the cardiac Ca2+ pump) and PLB (its ventricular peptide inhibitor) to test directly the effectiveness of loss-of-inhibition/gain-of-binding (LOI/GOB) PLB mutants (PLBM) that were engineered to compete with the binding of inhibitory wild type PLB (PLBWT). Our therapeutic strategy is to relieve PLBWT inhibition of SERCA2a by utilizing the reserve adrenergic capacity of PLB to enhance baseline cardiac contractility. Using a FRET assay, we determined that the combination of a LOI PLB mutation (L31A) and a GOB PLB mutation (I40A) results in a novel engineered LOI/GOB PLBM (L31A/I40A) that effectively competes with PLBWT binding to cardiac SERCA2a in HEK293-6E cells. We demonstrated that co-expression of L31A/I40A-PLBM enhances SERCA Ca-ATPase activity by increasing enzyme Ca2+ affinity (1/KCa) in PLBWT-inhibited HEK cell homogenates. For an initial assessment of PLBM physiological effectiveness, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from a healthy individual. In this system, we observed that adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-driven expression of L31A/I40A-PLBM enhances the amplitude of SR Ca2+ release and the rate of SR Ca2+ re-uptake. To assess therapeutic potential, we used an hiPSC-CM model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) containing PLB mutation R14del, where we observed that rAAV2-driven expression of L31A/I40A-PLBM rescues arrhythmic Ca2+ transients and alleviates decreased Ca2+ transport. Based on these results, PLBM transgene expression is a promising gene therapy strategy for cardiomyopathies associated with impaired Ca2+ transport and decreased contractility.",

Here, we report a  support vector machine classifier that quickly and accurately distinguishes RcGTA-like genes from their viral homologs by capturing the differences in the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. Our open-source classifier is implemented in Python and can be used to scan homologs of the RcGTA genes in newly sequenced genomes. The classifier can also be trained to identify other types of GTAs, or even to detect other elements of viral ancestry. Using the classifier trained on a manually curated set of homologous viruses and GTAs, we detected RcGTA-like  head-tail gene clusters in 57.5% of the 1,423 examined alphaproteobacterial genomes. We also demonstrated that more than half of the in silico prophage predictions are instead likely to be GTAs, suggesting that in many alphaproteobacterial genomes the RcGTA-like elements remain unrecognized.\\n\\nData depositionSequence alignments and phylogenetic trees are available in a FigShare repository at DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.8796419.

    "abstract": "A progressive decline of skeletal muscle strength with aging is a primary cause of mobility loss and frailty in older persons, but the molecular mechanisms of such decline are not fully understood. Here, using quantitative discovery proteomic data from skeletal muscle specimens collected from 58 healthy persons aged 20 to 87 years show that ribosomal proteins and proteins related to energetic metabolism, including those related to the TCA cycle, mitochondria respiration, and glycolysis were underrepresented in older persons. Proteins with important roles in innate and adaptive immunity, involved in proteostasis and regulation of alternative splicing were all overrepresented in muscle from older persons. Changes with aging of alternative splicing were confirmed by RNA-seq. Overall, older muscle has a profound deficit of energetic metabolism, a pro-inflammatory environment and increased proteostasis. Upregulation of the splicing machinery maybe an attempt to compensate for these changes and this could be tested in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) used off-label as an intravascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. Additionally, ferumoxytol-uptake by macrophages facilitates detection of inflammatory sites by MRI through ferumoxytol-induced image contrast changes. Therefore, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI holds great potential for assessing vascular function and inflammatory response, critical to determine placental health in pregnancy. This study sought to assess the fetoplacental unit and selected maternal tissues, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal well-being after ferumoxytol administration. In initial developmental studies, pregnant rhesus macaques were imaged with and without ferumoxytol administration. Pregnancies went to term with vaginal delivery and infants showed normal growth rates compared to control animals born the same year that did not undergo MRI. To determine the impact of ferumoxytol on the maternal-fetal interface, fetal well-being, and pregnancy outcome, four pregnant rhesus macaques at [~]100 gd (gestational day) underwent MRI before and after ferumoxytol administration. Collection of the fetoplacental unit and selected maternal tissues was performed 3-4 days following ferumoxytol administration. A control group that did not receive ferumoxytol or MRI was used for comparison. Iron levels in fetal and maternal-fetal interface tissues did not vary between groups. There was no significant difference in tissue histopathology with or without exposure to ferumoxytol, and no effect on placental hormone secretion. Together, these results suggest that the use of ferumoxytol and MRI in pregnant rhesus macaques will not introduce a detectable risk to the mother or fetus at the time of imaging or up to one year following normal vaginal delivery.\\n\\nSummary SentenceFerumoxytol magnetic resonance imaging for non-invasive pregnancy monitoring of the rhesus macaque does not impact histopathology or iron content of the maternal-fetal interface.",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows that introgression between closely-related species is an important source of adaptive alleles for a wide range of taxa. Typically, detection of adaptive introgression from genomic data relies on comparative analyses that require sequence data from both the recipient and the donor species. However, in many cases, the donor is unknown or the data is not currently available. Here, we introduce a genome-scan method--VolcanoFinder--to detect recent events of adaptive introgression using polymorphism data from the recipient species only.\\n\\nVolcanoFinder detects adaptive introgression sweeps from the pattern of excess intermediate-frequency polymorphism they produce in the flanking region of the genome, a pattern which appears as a volcano-shape in pairwise genetic diversity.\\n\\nUsing coalescent theory, we derive analytical predictions for these patterns. Based on these results, we develop a composite-likelihood test to detect signatures of adaptive introgression relative to the genomic background. Simulation results show that VolcanoFinder has high statistical power to detect these signatures, even for older sweeps and for soft sweeps initiated by multiple migrant haplotypes. Finally, we implement VolcanoFinder to detect archaic introgression in European and sub-Saharan African human populations, and uncovered interesting candidates in both populations, such as TSHR in Europeans and TCHH-RPTN in Africans. We discuss their biological implications and provide guidelines for identifying and circumventing artifactual signals during empirical applications of VolcanoFinder.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe process by which beneficial alleles are introduced into a species from a closely-related species is termed adaptive introgression. We present an analytically-tractable model for the effects of adaptive introgression on non-adaptive genetic variation in the genomic region surrounding the beneficial allele. The result we describe is a characteristic volcano-shaped pattern of increased variability that arises around the positively-selected site, and we introduce an open-source method VolcanoFinder to detect this signal in genomic data. Importantly, VolcanoFinder is a population-genetic likelihood-based approach, rather than a comparative-genomic approach, and can therefore probe genomic variation data from a single population for footprints of adaptive introgression, even from a priori unknown and possibly extinct donor species.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to environmental perturbations and insults through modulating protein abundance and function. However, the majority of studies have focused on changes in RNA abundance because quantitative transcriptomics has historically been more facile than quantitative proteomics. Modern Orbitrap mass spectrometers now provide sensitive and deep proteome coverage, allowing direct, global quantification of not only protein abundance, but also post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate protein activity. We implemented, and validated using the well-characterized heat shock response of budding yeast, a tandem mass tagging (TMT), triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS3) strategy to measure global changes in the proteome during the yeast heat shock response over nine timepoints. We report that basic pH, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) fractionation of tryptic peptides yields superfractions of minimal redundancy, a crucial requirement for deep coverage and quantification by subsequent LC-MS3. We quantified 2,275 proteins across 3 biological replicates, and found that differential expression peaked near 90 minutes following heat shock (with 868 differentially expressed proteins at 5% FDR). The sensitivity of the approach also allowed us to detect changes in the relative abundance of ubiquitination and phosphorylation PTMs over time. Remarkably, relative quantification of post-translationally modified peptides revealed striking evidence of regulation of the heat shock response by protein PTMs. These data demonstrate that the high precision of TMT-MS3 enables peptide-level quantification of samples, which can reveal important regulation of protein abundance and regulatory PTMs under various experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an extremely lethal type of brain tumor as it frequently develops therapeutic resistance over months of chemotherapy cycles. Hence, there is a critical need to provide relevant biological systems to guide the development of new potent personalized drugs but also efficient methodologies that enable personalized prediction of various therapeutic regimens for enhanced patient prognosis. Towards this goal, we report on the development of i) an appropriate in vitro model that mimics the 3D tumor microenvironment and ii) a companion imaging modality that enables to assess this in vitro model in its entirety. More precisely, we developed an integrated platform of bio-printing in vitro 3D GBM models and mesoscopic imaging to monitor tumor growth and invasion along with long-term drug treatment. The newly-developed in vitro 3D model contains tumor spheroids made of patient-derived glioma stem cells with a fluorescent reporter and vascular channels for drug perfusion. The imaging of these thick tissue constructs was performed using our second-Generation Mesoscopic Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (2GMFMT) imaging system which delivered 3D reconstruction of the fluidic channels and the GBM spheroids over the course of pre- and post-drug treatment (up to 70 days). The 2D measurements collected via 2GMFMT was comparable to existing imaging modalities, but 2GMFMT enabled non-sacrificial volumetric monitoring that provided a unique insgiht into the GBM spheroid growth and drug response. Overall, our integrated platform provides customizable in vitro model systems combined with an efficient long-term non-sacrificial imaging for the volumetric change of tumor mass, thus has a great potential in profoundly affecting the drug pipeline for a vast array of pathologies as well as for guiding personalized therapeutic regimen.",

The prevalent view is that it is a two-step process: first cells wedge to bend the sheet, then cells intercalate and extend the initial invagination into a tube. We computationally challenged this model by asking if one mechanism (either cell wedging or intercalation) may suffice for the entire sheet-to-tube transition. Using a physical model with epithelial cells represented by polarized point particles, we show that either cell intercalation or wedging alone can be sufficient and each can both bend the sheet and extend the tube. When working in parallel, the two mechanisms increase the robustness of the tube formation. The successful simulations of Drosophila salivary gland, Sea urchin gastrulation and mammalian neurulation support the generality of our results.",

    "abstract": "In biobank data analysis, most binary phenotypes have unbalanced case-control ratios, which can cause inflation of type I error rates. Recently, a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) based single variant test has been developed to provide an accurate and scalable method to test for associations of such phenotypes. For gene- or region-based multiple variant tests, a few methods exist which adjust for unbalanced case-control ratios; however, these methods are either less accurate when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced or not scalable for large data analyses. To address these problems, we propose SKAT/SKAT-O type region-based tests, where the single-variant score statistic is calibrated based on SPA and Efficient Resampling (ER). Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed method provides well-calibrated p-values. In contrast, the unadjusted approach has greatly inflated type I error rates (90 times of exome-wide  =2.5x10-6) when the case-control ratio is 1:99. Additionally, the proposed method has similar computation time as the unadjusted approaches and is scalable for large sample data. Our UK Biobank whole exome sequence data analysis of 45,596 unrelated European samples and 791 PheCode phenotypes identified 10 rare variant associations with p-value < 10-7, including the associations between JAK2 and myeloproliferative disease, TNC and large cell lymphoma and F11 and congenital coagulation defects.

In this study, we investigated the effects of hepatitis C virus clearance on markers of systemic inflammation measured in plasma samples from CHC patients before, during and after DAA therapy. We identified a plasma soluble protein profile associated with CHC. Successful DAA therapy rapidly normalised the plasma inflammatory milieu, with the notable exception of soluble (s) CD163, a marker of macrophage activation, which remained elevated after viral clearance and segregated patients with high and low levels of cirrhosis. Patients who received DAA in combination with Ribavirin maintained elevated levels of CXCL10, consistent with an immune-stimulatory role of Ribavirin. As anticipated, DAA-treated patients experienced durable improvement in liver fibrosis measurements. Interestingly, pre-treatment levels of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) were inversely associated with reduction of APRI and FIB-4 scores during treatment. Together, these results support the notion of a rapid restoration of many aspects of the inflammatory state in CHC patients in response to DAA therapy. Furthermore, the associations with sCD163 and FABP4 warrants further investigation into the role of macrophages in residual liver disease and fibrosis resolution after viral clearance.",

Therefore we have sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated, the draft genome of one of the most studied coral species, Pocillopora acuta (ex damicornis).

The de novo assembly was performed with Platanus (352 Mb; 25,553 scaffolds; N50 171,375 bp). 36,140 genes were annotated by RNA-seq data and 64,558 by AUGUSTUS (Hidden-Markov model).

Essentially comprised of dead mycobacteria and mineral oil, we asked ourselves what is special about the mycobacterial part of this adjuvant, and could it be recapitulated synthetically?

A combination of synthetic N-glycolyl muramyl dipeptide and minimal trehalose dimycolate motif GlcC14C18 was able to upregulate dendritic cell effectors, plus induce experimental autoimmunity qualitatively similar but quantitatively milder compared to CFA. This research outlines how to substitute CFA with a consistent, molecularly-defined adjuvant which may inform the design of immunotherapeutic agents and vaccines benefitting from cell-mediated immunity. We also anticipate using synthetic microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) to study mycobacterial immunity and immunopathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPrimary succession models focus on aboveground vascular plants. However, the prevalence of mosses and lichens, i.e. cryptogams, suggests they play a role in soil successions. Here, we explore whether effects of cryptogams on belowground microbes can facilitate progressive shifts in sand dune succession.\nC_LIO_LIWe linked aboveground vegetation, belowground bacterial and fungal community, and soil chemistry in six successional stages in Arctic inland sand dunes: bare sand, grass, moss, lichen, ericoid heath and mountain birch forest.\nC_LIO_LICompared to the bare sand and grass stages, microbial biomass and the proportion of fungi increased in the moss stage, and later stage microbial groups appeared despite the absence of their host plants. The microbial communities of the lichen stage resembled the communities in the vascular plant stages. Bacterial community correlated better with soil chemistry than with vegetation, whereas the correlation of fungi with vegetation increased with vascular vegetation.\nC_LIO_LIDistinct bacterial and fungal patterns of biomass, richness, and plant-microbe interaction showed that the aboveground vegetation change structured the bacterial and fungal community differently. The nonalignment of aboveground vs. belowground changes suggests that cryptogams can drive succession towards vascular plant dominance through microbially mediated facilitation in eroded Arctic soil.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in urine is a promising analyte for noninvasive diagnostics. However, urine cfDNA is highly fragmented and whether characteristics of these fragments reflect underlying genomic architecture is unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive characterization of fragmentation patterns in urine cfDNA. We show modal size and genome-wide distribution of urine cfDNA fragments are consistent with transient protection from degradation by stable intermediates of nucleosome disassembly. Genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and fragment sizes in urine cfDNA are informative of cell of origin and renal epithelial cells are amongst the highest contributors in urine. Compared to a nucleosome occupancy map based on control urine samples, we observe a higher fraction of fragments with aberrant ends in cancer patients, distinguishing cancer samples with an area under the curve of 0.89. Our results demonstrate sub-nucleosomal organization in urine cfDNA and are proof-of-principle that genome-wide fragmentation analysis of urine cfDNA can enable cancer diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cell division requires the mitotic spindle, a microtubule (MT)-based structure which accurately aligns and segregates duplicated chromosomes. The dynamics of spindle formation are determined primarily by correctly localising the MT nucleator,{gamma} -Tubulin Ring Complex ({gamma}-TuRC)1-4, within the cell. A conserved MT-associated protein complex, Augmin, recruits{gamma} -TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs, amplifying their number, in an essential cellular phenomenon termed \\\"branched\\\" MT nucleation5-9. Here, we purify endogenous, GFP-tagged Augmin and{gamma} -TuRC from Drosophila embryos to near homogeneity using a novel one-step affinity technique. We demonstrate that, in vitro, while Augmin alone does not affect Tubulin polymerisation dynamics, it stimulates{gamma} -TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also assemble and visualise the MT-Augmin-{gamma}-TuRC-MT junction using light microscopy. Our work therefore conclusively reconstitutes branched MT nucleation. It also provides a powerful synthetic approach with which to investigate the emergence of cellular phenomena, such as mitotic spindle formation, from component parts.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are nucleated from specific locations at precise times in the cell cycle. However, the factors that constitute these microtubule nucleation pathways still need to be identified along with their mode of action. Here, using purified Xenopus laevis proteins we biochemically reconstitute branching microtubule nucleation, a nucleation pathway where microtubules originate from pre-existing microtubules, which is essential for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. We found that besides the microtubule nucleator gamma-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}-TuRC), the two branching effectors augmin and TPX2 are required to efficiently nucleate branched microtubules. Specifically, TPX2 generates regularly-spaced patches that recruit augmin and {gamma}-TuRC to microtubules, which then nucleate new microtubules at preferred branching angles of less than 90 degrees. Our work demonstrates how {gamma}-TuRC is brought to its nucleation site for branching microtubule nucleation. It provides a blueprint for other microtubule nucleation pathways and for generating a particular microtubule architecture by regulating microtubule nucleation.",
