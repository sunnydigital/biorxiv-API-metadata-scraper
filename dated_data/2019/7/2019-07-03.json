The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, serves as a clinically relevant model for studying the interaction between eukaryotic ploidy and stress-induced mutagenesis. In this study, we compared the rates and types of genome perturbations in diploid and tetraploid C. albicans following exposure to two classes of antifungal drugs, azoles and echinocandins. We measured mutations at three different scales: point mutation, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), and genome size changes in cells treated with fluconazole and caspofungin. We find that caspofungin induced higher rates of mutation than fluconazole, likely an indirect result from the stress associated with cell wall perturbations rather than an inherent genotoxicity. Furthermore, we found disproportionately elevated rates of LOH and genome size changes in response to both antifungals in tetraploid C. albicans compared to diploid C. albicans, suggesting that the magnitude of stress-induced mutagenesis results from an interaction between ploidy state and the environment. These results have both clinical and evolutionary implications for how fungal pathogens generate mutations in response to antifungal drug stress, and may facilitate the emergence of antifungal resistance.",

    "abstract": "The calyx of Held, a large glutamatergic presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem undergoes developmental changes to support the high action-potential firing rates required for auditory information encoding. In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HdAd) that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mito-APEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semi-automated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole terminal reconstruction and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day 7 (P7) and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.\\n\\nSignificance StatementElucidating the developmental processes of auditory brainstem presynaptic terminals is critical to understanding auditory information encoding. Additionally, morphological-functional diversity at these terminals is proposed to enhance coding capacity. Mitochondria provide energy for synaptic transmission and can buffer calcium, impacting synaptic plasticity; however, their developmental profile to ultimately support the energetic demands of synapses following the onset of hearing remains unknown. Therefore, we created a helper-dependent adenoviral vector with the mitochondria-targeting peroxidase mito-APEX2 and expressed it at the mouse calyx of Held. Volumetric reconstructions of serial block face electron microscopy data of immature and mature labeled calyces reveal that mitochondrial volumes are increased to support high firing rates upon maturity.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory is believed to be intimately related to our experience of the passage of time. Indeed, neurons in the hippocampus and other brain regions critical to episodic memory code for the passage of time at a range of time scales. The origin of this temporal signal, however, remains unclear. Here, we examined temporal responses in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys as they viewed complex images. Many neurons in the entorhinal cortex were responsive to image onset, showing large deviations from baseline firing shortly after image onset but relaxing back to baseline at different rates. This range of relaxation rates allowed for the time since image onset to be decoded on the scale of seconds. Further, these neurons carried information about image content, suggesting that neurons in the entorhinal cortex carry information not only about when an event took place but also the identity of that event. Taken together, these findings suggest that the primate entorhinal cortex uses a spectrum of time constants to construct a temporal record of the past in support of episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Children with unilateral resections of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) typically do not evince visual perceptual impairments, even when relatively large swathes of VOTC are resected. In search of possible explanations for this behavioral competence, we evaluated white matter microstructure and connectivity in eight pediatric epilepsy patients following unilateral cortical resection and 15 age-matched controls. To uncover both local and broader resection-induced effects, we analyzed tractography data using two complementary approaches. First, the microstructural properties were measured in the inferior longitudinal and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the major VOTC association tracts. Group differences were only evident in the ipsilesional, and not in the contralesional, hemisphere, and single-subject analyses revealed that these differences were limited to the site of the resection. Second, graph theory was used to characterize the connectivity of the contralesional occipito-temporal regions. There were no changes to the network properties in patients with left VOTC resections nor in patients with resections outside the VOTC, but altered network efficiency was observed in two cases with right VOTC resections. These results suggest that, in many, although perhaps not all, cases of unilateral VOTC resections in childhood, the white matter integrity in the preserved contralesional hemisphere along with residual neural activity might be sufficient for normal visual perception.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThere is well-circumscribed white matter damage in pediatric epilepsy after surgery\\nC_LIO_LIWhite matter pathways are normal distal as well as contralesional to the resection\\nC_LIO_LIContralesional network properties differ after left or right hemisphere resection\\nC_LIO_LIPreserved cortex and white matter may be sufficient for normal perception\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mutations in a gene encoding RNA-binding protein FUS was linked to familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). C-terminal truncations of FUS are associated with aggressive forms of ALS. However, motor neurons are able to tolerate permanent production of pathogenic truncated form of FUS protein until its accumulation in the cytoplasm of neurones does not reach a critical threshold.\\n\\nIn order to identify how the nervous system responds to pathogenic variants of FUS we produced and characterised a mouse line, L-FUS[1-359], with a low level of neuronal expression of a highly aggregation prone and pathogenic form of C-terminally truncated FUS. In contrast to mice with substantially higher level of expression of the same FUS variant that develop severe early onset motor neuron pathology, L-FUS[1-359] mice do not develop any sign of pathology even at old age. Nevertheless, we detected substantial changes in the spinal cord transcriptome of these mice comparing to the wild type littermates. We suggest that at least some of these changes reflect activation of cellular mechanisms compensating to potentially damaging effect of pathogenic FUS production. Further studies of these mechanism might reveal effective target for therapy of FUS-ALS and possibly, other forms of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the functional analysis of gene expression data has used pathway and network enrichment algorithms. These methods are usually gene rather than transcript centric and hence fall short to unravel functional roles associated to posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms such as Alternative Splicing (AS) and Alternative PolyAdenylation (APA), jointly referred here as Alternative Transcript Processing (AltTP). Moreover, short-read RNA-seq has serious limitations to resolve full-length transcripts, further complicating the study of isoform expression. Recent advances in long-read sequencing open exciting opportunities for studying isoform biology and function. However, there are no established bioinformatics methods for the functional analysis of isoform-resolved transcriptomics data to fully leverage these technological advances. Here we present a novel framework for Functional Iso-Transcriptomics analysis (FIT). This framework uses a rich isoform-level annotation database of functional domains, motifs and sites -both coding and non-coding- and introduces novel analysis methods to interrogate different aspects of the functional relevance of isoform complexity. The Functional Diversity Analysis (FDA) evaluates the variability at the inclusion/exclusion of functional domains across annotated transcripts of the same gene. Parameters can be set to evaluate if AltTP partially or fully disrupts functional elements. FDA is a measure of the potential of a multiple isoform transcriptome to have a functional impact. By combining these functional labels with expression data, the Differential Analysis Module evaluates the relative contribution of transcriptional (i.e. gene level) and post-transcriptional (i.e. transcript/protein levels) regulation on the biology of the system. Measures of isoform relevance such as Minor Isoform Filtering, Isoform Switching Events and Total Isoform Usage Change contribute to restricting analysis to biologically meaningful changes. Finally, novel methods for Differential Feature Inclusion, Co-Feature Inclusion, and the combination of UTR-lengthening with Alternative Polyadenylation analyses carefully dissects the contextual regulation of functional elements resulting from differential isoforms usage. These methods are implemented in the software tappAS, a user-friendly Java application that brings FIT to the hands of non-expert bioinformaticians supporting several model and non-model species. tappAS complements statistical analyses with powerful browsing tools and highly informative gene/transcript/CDS graphs.\\n\\nWe applied tappAS to the analysis of two mouse Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs) and Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells (OPCs) whose transcriptome was defined by PacBio and quantified by Illumina. Using FDA we confirmed the high potential of AltTP regulation in our system, in which 90% of multi-isoform genes presented variation in functional features at the transcript or protein level. The Differential Analysis module revealed a high interplay between transcriptional and AltTP regulation in neural development, mainly controlled by differential expression, but where AltTP acts the main driver of important neural development biological mechanisms such as vesicle trafficking, signal transduction and RNA processing. The DFI analysis revealed that, globally, AltTP increased the availability of functional features in differentiated neural cells. DFI also showed that AltTP is a mechanism for altering gene function by changing cellular localization and binding properties of proteins, via the differential inclusion of NLS, transmembrane domains or DNA binding motifs, for example. Some of these findings were experimentally validated by others and us.\\n\\nIn summary, we propose a novel framework for the functional analysis of transcriptomes at isoform resolution. We anticipate the tappAS tool will be an important resource for the adoption of the Functional Iso-Transcriptomics analysis by functional genomics community.",

We computationally translated descriptions of plant phenotypes into structured representations that can be analyzed to identify biologically meaningful associations. These repre-sentations include the EQ (Entity-Quality) formalism, which uses terms from biological ontologies to represent phenotypes in a standardized, semantically-rich format, as well as numerical vector representations generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods (such as the bag-of-words approach and document embedding). We compared resulting phenotype similarity measures to those derived from manually curated data to determine the performance of each method. Computationally derived EQ and vector representations were comparably successful in recapitulating biological truth to representations created through manual EQ statement curation. Moreover, NLP methods for generating vector representations of phenotypes are scalable to large quantities of text because they require no human input. These results indicate that it is now possible to computationally and automatically produce and populate large-scale information resources that enable researchers to query phenotypic descriptions directly.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMyogenesis is driven by specific changes in the transcriptome that occur during the different stages of muscle differentiation. In addition to controlled transcriptional transitions, several other post-transcriptional mechanisms direct muscle differentiation. Both alternative splicing and miRNA activity regulate gene expression and production of specialized protein isoforms. Importantly, disruption of either process often results in severe phenotypes as reported for several muscle diseases. Thus, broadening our understanding of the post-transcriptional pathways that operate in muscles will lay the foundation for future therapeutic interventions.\\n\\nMethodsWe employed bioinformatics analysis in concert with the well-established C2C12 cell system for predicting and validating novel miR-1 and miR-206 targets engaged in muscle differentiation. We used reporter gene assays to test direct miRNA targeting and studied C2C12 cells stably expressing one of the cDNA candidates fused to a heterologous, miRNA-resistant 3 UTR. We monitored effects on differentiation by measuring fusion index, myotube area, and myogenic gene expression during time course differentiation experiments.\\n\\nResultsGene ontology analysis revealed a strongly enriched set of putative miR-1 and miR-206 targets associated with RNA metabolism. Notably, the expression levels of several candidates decreased during C2C12 differentiation. We discovered that the splicing factor Srsf9 is a direct target of both miRNAs during myogenesis. Persistent Srsf9 expression during differentiation impaired myotube formation and blunted induction of the early pro-differentiation factor myogenin as well as the late differentiation marker sarcomeric myosin, Myh8.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data uncover novel miR-1 and miR-206 cellular targets and establish a functional link between the splicing factor Srsf9 and myoblast differentiation. The finding that miRNA-mediated clearance of Srsf9 is a key myogenic event illustrates the coordinated and sophisticated interplay between the diverse components of the gene regulatory network.",

Upon re-analysis of the raw data used to compose figure 2I, we noted inconsistencies in the inclusion of datapoints, for which a satisfactory motivation was not apparent.\n\nIn order to reproduce the experiments with the DNA-PK inhibitor, we ordered new batches of this compound, but noticed that the IC50 was significantly lower than that of the earlier batch (as determined in suppl. fig.1). While this might be due to a difference in batches, the IC50 of the newer batches was more comparable to the IC50 of this compound described for other cell lines. This sheds doubts on the quality of the batch used for the experiments shown in our manuscript, and we no longer wish to draw any conclusions based on these experiments.\n\nThe authors hope that future experiments can resolve if open chromatin does indeed produce a potentially more toxic DNA break.

    "abstract": "Shifting from the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms to the reconstruction of selected haplotypes greatly facilitates the interpretation of Evolve and Resequence (E&R) experiments. Merging highly correlated hitchhiker SNPs into haplotype blocks reduces thousands of candidates to few selected regions. Current methods of haplotype reconstruction from Pool-Seq data need a variety of data-specific parameters that are typically defined ad hoc and require haplotype sequences for validation. Here, we introduce haplovalidate, a tool which detects selected haplotypes in a broad range of Pool-seq time series data without the need of sequenced haplotypes. Haplovalidate makes data-driven choices of two key parameters for the clustering procedure, the minimum correlation between SNPs constituting a cluster and the window size. Applying haplovalidate to simulated and experimental E&R data reliably detects selected haplotype blocks with low false discovery rates - independent if few or many selection targets are included. Our analyses identified an important restriction of the haplotype block-based approach to describe the genomic architecture of adaptation. We detected a substantial fraction of haplotypes containing multiple selection targets. These blocks were considered as one region of selection and therefore led to under-estimation of the number of selection targets. We demonstrate that the separate analysis of earlier time points can significantly increase the separation of selection targets into individual haplotype blocks. We conclude that the analysis of selected haplotype blocks has a large potential for the characterisation of the adaptive architecture with E&R experiments.",

    "abstract": "The central paradigm of molecular population genetics is selective sweeps, where targets of selection have independent effects on the phenotype and quickly rise to fixation. In quantitative genetics, many loci contribute epistatically to adaptation and subtle frequency changes occur at many loci. Since both paradigms could result in a sweep-like genomic signature, additional criteria are needed to distinguish them. Using the framework of experimental evolution, we performed computer simulations to study the pattern of selected alleles under both paradigms. We identify several distinct patterns of selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation in populations of different sizes. These features could provide the foundation for development of quantitative approaches to differentiate the two paradigms.\\n\\nAuthors summaryThe selective sweep model assumes an independent frequency increase of favorable alleles and has been the basis of many tests for selection. While, polygenic adaptation is typically modelled by small frequency shifts in many loci. Recently, some theoretical and empirical work demonstrated that polygenic adaptation, similar to sweep, could also results in pronounced allele frequency changes. These results suggest that other distinct features need to be identified. Using computer simulations, we identified distinctive features for each paradigm that can be used to differentiate the sweep model from polygenic adaptation. Features such as allele frequency trajectories, time-series fitness, distribution of selected alleles on haplotypes, and parallelism among replicates can be used for development of suitable tests to distinguish between different adaptive architectures. These features provide the basis for theoretical modeling, design of selection experiments and data analysis.",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, skeletal muscle evolved to contract and produce force. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that skeletal muscle has also acquired endocrine functions and produces a vast array of myokines. Using ChIP-Seq and gene expression analyses of myogenic factors, we show that Myf6/MRF4 transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of myokines and muscle-secreted proteins, including ligands for downstream activation of key signaling pathways such as EGFR, STAT3 and VEGFR. Homozygous deletion of Myf6 causes a significant reduction in the ability of muscle to produce key myokines such as EGF, VEGFA and LIF. Consequently, although Myf6 knockout mice are born with a normal muscle stem cell compartment, they undergo progressive reduction in their stem cell pool during postnatal life. Mechanistically, muscle stem cells from the Myf6 knockout animals show defects in activation of EGFR and STAT3 signaling, upregulate the p38 MAP kinase pathway and spontaneously break from quiescence. Exogenous application of recombinant EGF and LIF rescue the defects in the muscle stem cell pool of Myf6 knockout animals. Finally, skeletal muscles of mice lacking Myf6 have a significantly reduced ability to sustain donor-engrafted muscle stem cells. Taken together, our data uncovers a novel role for Myf6 in regulating the expression of niche factors and myokines to maintain the skeletal muscle stem cell pool in adult mice.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of mice to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) produces depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and widespread transcriptomic changes in several brain regions in susceptible animals. Here we present the first study of genome-wide cytosine methylation patterns of mice susceptible to CSDS using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on DNA from the nucleus accumbens, a critical region for CSDS effects on behavior. We found extensive evidence for differential methylation following exposure to CSDS in susceptible animals, with a greater proportion of CG hypermethylation than hypomethylation in CSDS-susceptible mice compared to non-stressed controls; non-CG methylation shows the opposite trend. Several genes previously implicated in the effects of CSDS are among those with the greatest number of differentially methylated sites, including estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), the deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc) gene and Cacna1c, which has been associated with a range of psychiatric conditions. Informatic analysis of DM sites revealed a gene network with {beta}-catenin as the hub gene of a network that included the {beta}-catenin-related WNT/frizzled signaling pathway as well as both Esr1 and Dcc. Finally, we found considerable overlap between DM genes associated with CSDS in susceptible animals and those associated with human neuroticism in a genome-wide association study. Analysis of these overlapping genes revealed  WNT signaling as the top pathway, which features {beta}-catenin as the primary hub gene. These findings reveal a striking convergence between the molecular pathways identified through either transcriptional or epigenomic analyses of the mouse model of susceptibility to chronic stress and the genomic architecture of increased stress susceptibility reflected in neuroticism in humans.",

However, we demonstrate here that defects in angiogenesis that can be attributed to high levels of endoglin, lead to development and worsening of cancer disease. Steady endoglin overexpression disrupts the correct stabilization of the endothelium and the recruitment of mural cells.

    "abstract": "Aging manifests itself through a decline in organismal homeostasis and a multitude of cellular and physiological functions1. Efforts to identify a common basis for vertebrate aging face many challenges; for example, while there have been documented changes in the expression of many hundreds of mRNAs, the results across tissues and species have been inconsistent2. We therefore analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from 17 mouse organs and 51 human organs using unsupervised machine learning3-5 to identify the architectural and regulatory characteristics most informative on the differential expression of genes with age. We report a hitherto unknown phenomenon, a systemic age-dependent length-driven transcriptome imbalance that for older organisms disrupts the homeostatic balance between short and long transcript molecules for mice, rats, killifishes, and humans. We also demonstrate that in a mouse model of healthy aging, length-driven transcriptome imbalance correlates with changes in expression of splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (Sfpq), which regulates transcriptional elongation according to gene length6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that length-driven transcriptome imbalance can be triggered by environmental hazards and pathogens. Our findings reinforce the picture of aging as a systemic homeostasis breakdown and suggest a promising explanation for why diverse insults affect multiple age-dependent phenotypes in a similar manner.",

Histidine phosphorylation is a long-time established but largely unexplored post-translational modification, mainly because of the acid-lability of the phosphoramidate bonds. This lability means that standard phosphoproteomic methods used for conventional phosphate esters (phospho-Ser/Thr/Tyr) must be modified to analyze proteins containing the phosphoramidate-amino acids - phospho-His/Arg/Lys. We show that a non-acidic method allows enrichment of non-conventional phosphoresidue-containing peptides from tryptic digests of human cell lines, using hydroxyapatite binding and/or immobilized 1-pHis and 3-pHis monoclonal antibodies for enrichment. 425 unique non-conventional phosphorylation sites (i.e. pHis, pLys and pArg) were detected with a high probability of localization by LC-MS/MS analysis and identified using a customized MaxQuant configuration, contributing to a new era of study in post-translational modification and cell signaling in humans.

During meiosis with the two rounds of microtubule assembly-disassembly, the roles of motor proteins remain unexplored. We observed that in contrast to mitosis Cin8 (kinesin 5) and Kip3 (kinesin 8) together are indispensable in meiosis. Examining the meiosis in cin8{triangleup} kip3{triangleup} cells, we detected chromosome breakage in the meiosis II cells. The double mutant exhibits delay in the cohesin removal and spindle elongation during anaphase I. Consequently, some cells abrogate meiosis II and form dyads while some, as they progress through meiosis II, cause defect in chromosome integrity. We believe that in the latter cells, an imbalance of spindle mediated force and simultaneous persistent cohesin on the chromosomes cause their breakage. We provide evidence that tension generated by Cin8 and Kip3 through microtubule cross-linking is essential for signaling efficient cohesin removal and maintenance of chromosome integrity during meiosis.\\n\\nSummaryMolecular motors generate forces that facilitate chromosome segregation.

    "abstract": "Many studies have focused on the mechanisms of stem cell maintenance via their interaction with a particular niche or microenvironment in adult tissues, but how formation of a functional niche is initiated, including how stem cells within a niche are established, is less well understood. Adult Drosophila melanogaster ovary Germline Stem Cell (GSC) niches are comprised of somatic cells forming a stack called a Terminal Filament (TF) and underlying Cap Cells (CCs) and Escort Cells (ECs), which are in direct contact with GSCs. In the adult, the Engrailed (En) transcription factor is specifically expressed in niche cells where it directly controls expression of the decapentaplegic gene (dpp) encoding a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family of secreted signaling molecules, which are key factors for GSC maintenance. In late third instar larval ovaries, in response to BMP signaling from newly-formed niches, adjacent primordial germ cells become GSCs. The bric-a-brac paralogs (bab1 and bab2) encode BTB/POZ-domain containing transcription factors, that are also expressed in developing GSCs niches where they are required for TF formation. Here, we demonstrate that Bab1 and Bab2 display redundant cell autonomous function for TF morphogenesis and we identify a new function for these genes in GSC establishment. Moreover, we show that Bab proteins control dpp expression in otherwise correctly specified CCs, independently of En and its paralog Invected (Inv). In fact, our results also indicate that en/inv function in larval stages are neither essential for TF formation, nor GSC establishment. Finally, when bab2 was overexpressed in ovarian somatic cells outside of the niche, where en/inv were not expressed, ectopic BMP signaling activation was induced in adjacent germ cells of adult ovaries, which formed GSC-like tumors. Together, these results indicate that Bab transcription factors are positive regulators of BMP signaling for acquisition of GSC status.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases involves the presence of a metastable subproteome vulnerable to aggregation. To investigate this subproteome and the mechanisms that regulates it, we measured the proteome solubility of the Neuro2a cell line under protein homeostasis stresses induced by Huntington Disease proteotoxicity; Hsp70, Hsp90, proteasome and ER-mediated folding inhibition; and oxidative stress. We found one-quarter of the proteome extensively changed solubility. Remarkably, almost all the increases in insolubility were counteracted by increases in solubility of other proteins. Each stress directed a highly specific pattern of change, which reflected the remodelling of protein complexes involved in adaptation to perturbation, most notably stress granule proteins, which responded differently to different stresses. These results indicate that the robustness of protein homeostasis relies on the absence of proteins highly vulnerable to aggregation and on large changes in aggregation state of regulatory mechanisms that restore protein solubility upon specific perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigations of rodent Tmem163 suggest that it binds to and transports zinc as a dimer, and that alanine mutagenesis of its two species-conserved aspartate (D123A/D127A) residues proposed to bind zinc perturbs protein function. Direct corroboration, however, is lacking whether it is an influx or efflux transporter in cells. We hypothesized that human TMEM163 is a zinc effluxer based on its predicted protein characteristics. We used cultured human cell lines that either stably or transiently expressed TMEM163, and pre-loaded the cells with zinc to determine transport activity. We found that TMEM163-expressing cells exhibited significant reduction of intracellular zinc levels as evidenced by two zinc-specific fluorescent dyes and radionuclide zinc-65. The specificity of the fluorescence signal was confirmed upon treatment with TPEN, a high-affinity zinc chelator. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses showed that TMEM163 is related to distinct members of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family. To further characterize the efflux function of TMEM163, we substituted alanine in two homologous aspartate residues (D124A/D128A) and performed site-directed mutagenesis of several conserved amino acid residues identified as non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (S61R, S95C, S193P, and E286K). We found a significant reduction of zinc efflux upon cellular expression of D124A/D128A or E286K protein variant when compared with wild-type, suggesting that these particular amino acids are important for normal protein function. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TMEM163 effluxes zinc and should now be designated ZNT11, as a new member of the mammalian CDF family of zinc efflux transporters.",
