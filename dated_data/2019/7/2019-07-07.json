    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting ground-truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power. Availability: GenEpi is an open-source python package and available free of charge only for non-commercial users. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/Chester75321/GenEpi, and has also been published on The Python Package Index.",

    "abstract": "Trust decisions are inherently uncertain, as people have incomplete information about the trustworthiness of the other prior to their decision. Therefore, it is beneficial to gather information about a trustees past behaviour before deciding whether or not to trust them. However, elaborate inquiries about a trustees behavior may change the trustees willingness to reciprocate, causing either a decrease due to the investor appearing suspicious, or an increase because the investor appears to be highly betrayal-averse. Such a change could cause the investor to gather less or more information, respectively. We examine how information acquisition is modulated by social context, monetary cost, and the trustees trustworthiness. Participants had the opportunity to sequentially sample information about a trustees reciprocation history before they decided whether or not to invest. On some trials, we induced a social context by telling the participant that the trustee would later learn how much the participant sampled (\\\"overt sampling\\\"). Participants sampled less when there was a monetary cost and when the reciprocation history was more conclusive. Crucially, when sampling was free and overt, participants sampled less, suggesting negative consequences of appearing suspicious. In post-experiment questionnaires, participants indeed reported a belief that the reciprocation probability would decrease when information was overtly sampled. The findings replicated in a second experiment and were well accounted for by a utility-maximizing model in which overt sampling induces a decrease in reciprocation probability. This study opens the door to broader applications of the tools and models of information sampling to social decision-making.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTrust and reciprocity are essential for establishing and maintaining beneficial cooperative interactions. However, not everyone can be trusted. Here, we focus on a fundamental question in the study of social interaction: how people gather and use information to make a decision to trust or not trust. While more information seems better, participants gathered less information about trustworthiness when the trustee would learn about the inquiries, as if they avoided appearing suspicious. Indeed, participants reported that they believed that sampling elaborately would make the trustee less willing to reciprocate trust. Using a mathematical model of information gathering, we show that this belief indeed reduces the value of information. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of information gathering in social contexts.",

Here we train two agents, a deep Q network and an actor-critic model, on a video game in which the player must capture a prey while avoiding a predator. A previously trained rhesus macaque performed well on this task, and in a manner that obeyed basic principles of Newtonian physics. We sought to compare the principles learned by artificial agents with those followed by the animal, as determined by the ability of one to predict the other. Our findings suggest that the agents learn primarily 1st order physics of motion, while the animal exhibited abilities consistent with the 2nd order physics of motion. We identify scenarios in which the actions taken by the animal and agents were consistent as well as ones in which they differed, including some surprising strategies exhibited by the agents. Finally, we remark on how the differences between how the agents and the macaque learn the task may affect their peak performance as well as their ability to generalize to other tasks.",

These bacteria belong to the order Pelagibacterales (SAR11) and are related to Pelagibacter (marine SAR11) that dominate many marine habitats. Although a handful of Pelagibacter phage (Pelagiphage) have been described, no phage that infect Fonsibacter have been reported. In this study, a complete Fonsibacter genome containing a prophage was reconstructed from metagenomic data. A circularized and complete genome related to the prophage, referred to as uv-Fonsiphage-EPL, shows high similarity to marine Pelagiphage HTVC025P. Additionally, we reconstructed three complete and one draft genome of phage related to marine Pelagiphage HTVC010P, and predicted a lytic strategy. The similarity in codon usage and co-occurrence patterns of HTVC010P-related phage and Fonsibacter suggested that these phage infect Fonsibacter. Similar phage were detected in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, where Fonsibacter is also present. A search of related phage revealed the worldwide distribution of some genotypes in freshwater ecosystems, suggesting their substantial role in shaping indigenous microbial assemblages and influence on biogeochemical cycling. However, the uv-Fonsiphage-EPL and one lineage of HTVC010P-related phage have a more limited distribution in freshwater ecosystems. Based on this, and their close phylogenetic relatedness with Pelagiphage, we predict that they transitioned from saline into freshwater ecosystems comparatively recently. Overall, the findings provide insights into the genomic features of phage that infect Fonsibacter, and expand understanding of the ecology and evolution of these important bacteria.",

    "abstract": "CD4 memory T cells play an important role in protective immunity and are a key target in vaccine development. Many studies have focused on T central memory (TCM) cells, while the existence and functional significance of T follicular helper (TFH) memory cells is controversial. Here we show that TFH memory cells are highly susceptible to NAD induced cell death (NICD) during isolation from tissues, leading to their under-representation in prior studies. NICD blockade reveals the persistence of abundant TFH memory cells, with high expression of hallmark TFH markers, that persist to at least 400 days after infection, by which time TCM cells are no longer found. Using single cell RNA-seq we demonstrate that TFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells, maintain stemness and self-renewal gene expression, and, in contrast to TCM cells, are multipotent following recall. Surprisingly, TFH memory cells concurrently express a distinct glycolytic signature similar to trained immune cells, including elevated expression of mTOR, HIF-1 and cAMP regulated genes. Late disruption of glycolysis/ICOS signaling leads to TFH memory cell depletion concomitant with decreased splenic plasma cells and circulating antibody titers, demonstrating both unique homeostatic regulation of memory TFH and their sustained function during the memory phase of the immune response. These results highlight the metabolic heterogeneity underlying distinct memory T cell subsets and establish TFH memory cells as an attractive target for the induction of long-lived adaptive immunity.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICell death during isolation from the tissue prevents the full recovery of TFH memory cells\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells and maintain a broader recall capacity\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are maintained in the absence of antigen but require ICOS signaling and glycolysis\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells support late phase antibody production by splenic plasma cells\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Organismal ploidy state and environmental stress impact the mutational spectrum and the mutational rate. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, serves as a clinically relevant model for studying the interaction between eukaryotic ploidy and stress-induced mutagenesis. In this study, we compared the rates and types of genome perturbations in diploid and tetraploid C. albicans following exposure to two classes of antifungal drugs, azoles and echinocandins. We measured mutations at three different scales: point mutation, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), and genome size changes in cells treated with fluconazole and caspofungin. We find that caspofungin induced higher rates of mutation than fluconazole, likely an indirect result from the stress associated with cell wall perturbations rather than an inherent genotoxicity. Furthermore, we found disproportionately elevated rates of LOH and genome size changes in response to both antifungals in tetraploid C. albicans compared to diploid C. albicans, suggesting that the magnitude of stress-induced mutagenesis results from an interaction between ploidy state and the environment. These results have both clinical and evolutionary implications for how fungal pathogens generate mutations in response to antifungal drug stress, and may facilitate the emergence of antifungal resistance.",

    "abstract": "For more than a decade, genome-wide association studies have been making steady progress in discovering the causal gene variants that contribute to late-onset human diseases. Polygenic late-onset diseases in an aging population display the risk allele frequency decrease at older ages, caused by individuals with higher polygenic risk scores becoming ill proportionately earlier and bringing about a change in the distribution of risk alleles between new cases and the as-yet-unaffected population. This phenomenon is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimers disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes, while for late-onset diseases with relatively lower prevalence and heritability, exemplified by cancers, the effect is significantly lower. Computer simulations have determined that genome-wide association studies of the late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability will benefit from using the youngest possible age-matched cohorts. Moreover, rather than using age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies.",

Advances in glycomics are elucidating the roles of glycans, but it remains challenging to properly analyze large glycomics datasets, since the data are sparse (each sample often has only a few measured glycans) and detected glycans are non-independent (sharing many intermediate biosynthetic steps). We address these challenges with GlyCompare, a glycomic data analysis approach that leverages shared biosynthetic pathway intermediates to correct for sparsity and non-independence in glycomics. Specifically, quantities of measured glycans are propagated to intermediate glycan substructures, which enables direct comparison of different glycoprofiles and increases statistical power. Using GlyCompare, we studied diverse N-glycan profiles from glycoengineered erythropoietin. We obtained biologically meaningful clustering of mutant cell glycoprofiles and identified knockout-specific effects of fucosyltransferase mutants on tetra-antennary structures. We further analyzed human milk oligosaccharide profiles and identified novel impacts that the mothers secretor-status on fucosylation and sialylation. Our substructure-oriented approach will enable researchers to take full advantage of the growing power and size of glycomics data.",

The sensory traps and sensory bias models have proven valuable for explaining how visual systems and environments shape the design of sexual signals, but their application to deceptive signals is largely untapped. Here we use the  jewelled orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata to experimentally test two longstanding hypotheses for the function of deceptive visual lures. Namely, that they: (1) exploit generalised preferences for conspicuous colouration (sensory bias), or (2) co-opt the otherwise-adaptive foraging response of prey toward flowers (sensory traps). In a field-based study we manipulated the conspicuous dorsal signal of female spiders along two axes --- colour pattern and symmetry -- to generate a gradient of floral resemblance, and monitored the per-individual consequences for prey interception. As predicted by the traps model, the most attractive phenotypes were those with flower-like radial symmetry and solid colour patterns, and their attractiveness equaled that of wild-type models. These results demonstrate that deceptive orb-web spider lures function, in part, as inter-kingdom sensory traps via floral mimicry, and support the broader extension of sensory-based models to deceptive signalling contexts.",

    "abstract": "Nestin, an intermediate filament protein widely used as a marker of neural progenitors, was recently found to be expressed transiently in developing cortical neurons in culture and in developing mouse cortex. In young cortical cultures, nestin regulates axonal growth cone morphology. In addition, nestin, which is known to bind the neuronal cdk5/p35 kinase, affects responses to axon guidance cues upstream of cdk5, specifically, to Sema3a. Changes in growth cone morphology require rearrangements of cytoskeletal networks, and changes in microtubules and actin filaments are well studied. In contrast, the roles of intermediate filament proteins in this process are poorly understood, even in cultured neurons. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which nestin affects growth cone morphology and Sema3a sensitivity. We find that nestin selectively facilitates the phosphorylation of the lissencephaly-linked protein doublecortin (DCX) by cdk5/p35, but the phosphorylation of other cdk5 substrates is not affected by nestin. We uncover that this substrate selectivity is based on the ability of nestin to interact with DCX, but not with other cdk5 substrates. Nestin thus creates a selective scaffold for DCX with activated cdk5/p35. Lastly, we use cortical cultures derived from DCX knockout mice to show that the effects of nestin on growth cone morphology and on Sema3a sensitivity are DCX-dependent, thus suggesting a functional role for the DCX-nestin complex in neurons. We propose that nestin changes growth cone behavior by regulating the intracellular kinase signaling environment in developing neurons. The sex of animal subjects is unknown.\n\nSignificance StatementNestin, an intermediate filament protein highly expressed in neural progenitors, was recently identified in developing neurons where it regulates growth cone morphology and responsiveness to the guidance cue Sema3a.

We now report that nestin selectively facilitates phosphorylation of the lissencephaly-linked doublecortin (DCX) by cdk5/p35, but the phosphorylation of other cdk5 substrates is not affected.

    "abstract": "Bacteria possess an array of defenses against foreign invaders, including diverse nucleases that target and destroy the genome of an invading bacteriophage or foreign DNA element. A recently-described bacteriophage immunity pathway employs a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase to produce a cyclic tri-AMP second messenger, which activates the DNA endonuclease effector NucC. Here, we show that NucC is related to restriction enzymes but uniquely assembles into a homotrimer in solution. cAAA binding in a conserved allosteric pocket promotes assembly of two NucC trimers into a homohexamer competent for double-strand DNA cleavage. We propose that NucC mediates bacteriophage immunity either through global activation, causing altruistic cell death and abortive infection, or through local activation and targeted phage genome destruction. Finally, we identify NucC homologs in type III CRISPR-Cas systems, where they likely function as accessory nucleases activated by cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers synthesized by these systems effector complexes.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular simulations are intrinsically high dimensional and generate noisy datasets of ever increasing size. Extracting important features in the data is crucial for understanding the biophysical properties of molecular processes, but remains a big challenge. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful dimensionality reduction tools. However, such methods are often criticized to resemble black boxes with limited human-interpretable insight.\n\nWe use methods from supervised and unsupervised ML to efficiently create interpretable maps of important features from molecular simulations. We benchmark the performance of several methods including neural networks, random forests and principal component analysis, using a toy model with properties reminiscent of macromolecular behavior. We then analyze three diverse biological processes: conformational changes within the soluble protein calmodulin, ligand binding to a G protein-coupled receptor and activation of an ion channel voltage-sensor domain, unravelling features critical for signal transduction, ligand binding and voltage sensing. This work demonstrates the usefulness of ML in understanding biomolecular states and demystifying complex simulations.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEUnderstanding how biomolecules function requires resolving the ensemble of structures they visit. Molecular dynamics simulations compute these ensembles and generate large amounts of data that can be noisy and need to be condensed for human interpretation. Machine learning methods are designed to process large amounts of data, but are often criticized for their black-box nature and have historically been modestly used in the analysis of biomolecular systems. We demonstrate how machine learning tools can provide an interpretable overview of important features in a simulation dataset. We develop a protocol to quickly perform data-driven analysis of molecular simulations. This protocol is applied to identify the molecular basis of ligand binding to a receptor and of voltage sensitivity of an ion channel.",

    "abstract": "GPA2/GPB5 and its receptor constitute a glycoprotein hormone-signalling system native to the genomes of most vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, including humans and mosquitoes. Unlike the well-studied gonadotropins and thyrotropin, the exact function of GPA2/GPB5 is unclear, and whether it elicits its functions as heterodimers, homodimers or as independent monomers remains unknown. Here, the glycoprotein hormone signalling system was investigated in adult mosquitoes, where GPA2 and GPB5 subunit transcripts co-localized to bilateral pairs of neuroendocrine cells within the first five abdominal ganglia of the central nervous system. Unlike human GPA2/GPB5 that demonstrated strong heterodimerization between subunits, the GPA2/GPB5 subunits in A. aegypti lacked evidence of heterodimerization when heterologously expressed. Interestingly, cross-linking analysis to determine subunit interactions revealed A. aegypti and H. sapiens GPA2 and GPB5 subunits form homodimers, and treatments with independent subunits did not activate A. aegypti LGR1 or H. sapiens TSH receptor, respectively. Since mosquito GPA2/GPB5 heterodimers were not evident by heterologous expression of independent subunits, a tethered construct was generated for expression of the subunits as a single polypeptide chain to improve heterodimer formation. Our findings revealed A. aegypti LGR1 elicited constitutive activity that elevated levels of cAMP as determined by increased cAMP-dependent luminescence. However, upon treatment with recombinant tethered GPA2/GPB5 heterodimers, an inhibitory G protein (Gi) signalling cascade is initiated and forskolin-induced cAMP production is inhibited. These results provide evidence towards the functional deorphanization of LGR1 and, moreover, further support the notion that GPA2/GPB5 heterodimerization is a requirement for glycoprotein hormone receptor activation.",

Here we use a data-driven systems biology approach across multiple cohorts of human AD, encompassing different brain regions, and integrate with multi-scale datasets comprising of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, transcriptome- and genome-wide association studies as well as quantitative trait loci to define the genetic architecture of AD. We perform co-expression network analysis across more than twelve hundred human brain samples, identifying robust AD-associated dysregulation of the transcriptome, unaltered in normal human aging. We further integrate co-expression modules with single-cell transcriptome generated from 27,321 nuclei from postmortem human brain to identify AD-specific transcriptional changes and assess cell-type proportion changes in the human AD brain. We also show that genetic variants of AD are enriched in a glial AD-associated module and identify key transcription factors regulating co-expressed modules. Additionally, we validate our results in multiple published human AD datasets which are easily accessible using our online resource (https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/consensusAD).",

Multimodal analyses relating clinical measures of impairment, electroencephalographic measures of spontaneous brain activity, and magnetic resonance imaging data of subcortical atrophy were conducted in 2018.\n\nResultsIn the final analyzed sample of 61 patients, systematic associations were found between electroencephalographic power spectra and subcortical damage. Specifically, the ratio of beta-to-delta relative power was negatively associated with greater atrophy in regions of the bilateral thalamus and globus pallidus (both left > right) previously shown to be preferentially atrophied in chronic disorders of consciousness. Power spectrum total density was also negatively associated with widespread atrophy in regions of the left globus pallidus, right caudate, and in brainstem. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of demographics, encephalographic, and imaging data in an analytic framework can be employed to aid behavioral diagnosis.\n\nConclusionsThese results ground, for the first time, electroencephalographic presentation detected with routine clinical techniques in the underlying brain pathology of disorders of consciousness and demonstrate how multimodal combination of clinical, electroencephalographic, and imaging data can be employed in potentially mitigating the high rates of misdiagnosis typical of this patient cohort.\n\nSearch termsdisorders of consciousness, subcortical pathology, EEG, MRI.",

To understand the mechanisms governing these dynamics, it is necessary to capture multi-timescale structure from behavioural data. Here, we develop computational tools and study the behaviour of hundreds of larval zebrafish tracked continuously across multiple 24-hour day/night cycles. We extracted millions of movements and pauses, termed bouts, and used unsupervised learning to reduce each larvas behaviour to an alternating sequence of active and inactive bout types, termed modules. Through hierarchical compression, we identified recurrent behavioural patterns, termed motifs. Module and motif usage varied across the day/night cycle, revealing structure at sub-second to day-long timescales. We further demonstrate that module and motif analysis can uncover novel pharmacological and genetic mutant phenotypes. Overall, our work reveals the organisation of larval zebrafish behaviour at multiple timescales and provides tools to identify structure from large-scale behavioural datasets.",

    "abstract": "Pattern completion, or the ability to retrieve stable neural activity patterns from noisy or partial cues, is a fundamental feature of memory. Theoretical studies indicate that recurrently connected auto-associative or discrete attractor network models can perform this process. Although phenomenological evidence for pattern completion and attractor dynamics have been described in various recurrent neural circuits, the crucial role that recurrent circuitry plays in implementing these processes has not been shown. Here we show that although odor representations in mouse olfactory bulb degrade under anesthesia, responses in downstream piriform cortex remain robust. Recurrent connections are required to stabilize cortical odor representations across states. Moreover, piriform odor representations exhibit attractor dynamics, both within and across trials, and these are also abolished when recurrent circuitry is eliminated. Thus, an auto-associative cortical circuit stabilizes output in response to degraded input, and the recurrent circuitry that defines these networks is required for this stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Listeners perceive sound-energy as originating from the direction of its source, even as direct sound is followed milliseconds later by reflected sound from multiple different directions. Early-arriving sound is emphasised in the ascending auditory pathway, including the medial superior olive (MSO) where binaural neurons encode the interaural time difference (ITD) cue for spatial location. Behaviourally, weighting of ITD conveyed during rising sound-energy is stronger at 600 Hz, a frequency with higher reverberant energy, than at 200 Hz where reverberant energy is lower. Here we computationally explore the combined effectiveness of adaptation before ITD-encoding, and excitatory binaural coincidence detection within MSO neurons, in emphasising ITD conveyed in early-arriving sound. With excitatory inputs from adapting model spherical bushy cells (SBCs) of the bilateral cochlear nuclei, a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model MSO neuron reproduces the frequency-dependent emphasis of rising vs. peak sound-energy in ITD-encoding. Maintaining the adaptation in model SBCs, and adjusting membrane speed in model MSO neurons, hemispheric populations of model SBCs and MSO neurons, with simplified membranes for computational efficiency, also reproduce the stronger weighting of ITD information conveyed during rising sound-energy at 600 Hz compared to 200 Hz. This hemispheric model further demonstrates a link between strong weighting of spatial information during rising sound-energy, and correct unambiguous lateralisation of reverberant speech.",

    "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with disruption of sensorimotor gating, which may contribute to difficulties inhibiting intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals. Neural mechanisms underlying these disturbances are unclear; however, striatal dopamine is implicated in regulation of sensorimotor gating and OCD pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to examine the relationships between sensorimotor gating, compulsive behavior, and striatal dopamine receptor levels in Sapap3 knockout mice (KOs), a widely used preclinical model system for OCD research. We found a trend for disruption of sensorimotor gating in Sapap3-KOs using the translational measure prepulse inhibition (PPI); however, there was significant heterogeneity in both PPI and compulsive grooming in KOs. Disruption of PPI was significantly correlated with a more severe compulsive phenotype. In addition, PPI disruption and compulsive grooming severity were associated with reduced dopamine D1 and D2/3 receptor density in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC). Compulsive grooming progressively worsened in Sapap3-KOs tested longitudinally, but PPI disruption was first detected in high-grooming KOs at 7 months of age. Through detailed characterization of individual differences in OCD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical measures, our findings suggest that NAcC dopamine receptor changes may be involved in disruption of sensorimotor gating and compulsive behavior relevant to OCD.",

    "abstract": "Mammals living in stable social groups often mitigate the costs of group living through the formation of social bonds and cooperative relationships. The neuropeptide hormone oxytocin (OT) has been proposed to promote both bonding and cooperation although only a limited number of studies have investigated this under natural conditions. Our aim was to assess the role of OT in bonding and cooperation in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). First we tested for an effect of affiliation - grooming and triadic male-infant-male interactions - with bond and non-bond partners on urinary OT levels. Secondly we aimed to test whether grooming interactions (and thus increased OT levels) increase a males general propensity to cooperate in polyadic conflicts. We collected behavioral data via full-day focal animal protocols on 14 adult males and measured endogenous OT levels from 139 urine samples collected after affiliation and non-social control periods. Urinary OT levels were higher after grooming with any partner. By contrast, OT levels after male-infant-male interactions with any partner or with bond partners were not different from controls but were higher after interactions with non-bond partners. Previous grooming did not increase the likelihood of males to support others in conflicts. Collectively, our results support research indicating that OT is involved in the regulation of adult social bonds, including in non-reproductive contexts. However, our male-infant-male interaction results go against previous studies suggesting that it is affiliation with bond rather than non-bond partners that trigger the release of OT. Alternatively, OT levels may have been elevated prior to male-infant-male interactions thus facilitating interaction between non-bond partners. The lack of an association of grooming (and by extension increased OT levels) and subsequent support speaks against an OT linked increase in the general propensity to cooperate, yet further studies are needed for a more direct test including the possibility of partner-specific contingent cooperation.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of social networks can determine the transmission of information, the spread of diseases, and the evolution of behavior. Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here, we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently, and when the breadth of social connectedness within the network increases, the social network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.\n\nSignificance StatementIn animal societies, social partnerships form a dynamic network that can change over time. Why are some social network structures more stable than others? We addressed this question by studying a cooperative bird species in which social behavior is important for fitness, similar to humans. We found that stable social networks are characterized by more frequent interactions, but sparser connectivity throughout the network. Using a simulation, we show how both results can be explained by a simple model of reciprocity. These findings indicate that social stability is governed by a trade-off whereby individuals can either maintain a few high-quality partners, or increase partner number. This fundamental trade-off may govern the dynamics and stability of many societies, including in humans.",

To gain insight we quantitatively investigated synaptic growth and connectivity in the Drosophila nociceptive network during larval development. We show that connectivity between primary nociceptors and their downstream neurons scales with animal size. We further identified the conserved Ste20-like kinase Tao as a negative regulator of synaptic growth required for maintenance of circuit specificity and connectivity. Loss of Tao kinase resulted in exuberant postsynaptic specializations and aberrant connectivity during larval growth. Using functional imaging and behavioral analysis we show that loss of Tao-induced ectopic synapses with inappropriate partner neurons are functional and alter behavioral responses in a connection-specific manner. Our data show that fine-tuning of synaptic growth by Tao kinase is required for maintaining specificity and behavioral output of the neuronal network during animal growth.",

    "abstract": "Theory predicts that social interactions can induce an alignment of behavioral asymmetries between individuals (i.e., population-level lateralization), but evidence for this effect is mixed. To understand how interaction with other individuals affects behavioral asymmetries, we systematically manipulated the social environment of Drosophila melanogaster, testing individual flies and dyads (female-male, female-female and male-male pairs). In these social contexts we measured individual and population asymmetries in individual behaviors (circling asymmetry, wing use) and dyadic behaviors (relative position and orientation between two flies) in five different genotypes. We reasoned that if coordination between individuals drives alignment of behavioral asymmetries, greater alignment at the population-level should be observed in social contexts compared to solitary individuals. We observed that the presence of other individuals influenced the behavior and position of flies but had unexpected effects with respect to individual and population asymmetries: individual-level asymmetries were strong and modulated by the social context but population-level asymmetries were mild or absent. Moreover, the strength of individual-level asymmetries differed between strains, but this was not the case for population-level asymmetries. These findings suggest that the degree of social interaction found in Drosophila is insufficient to drive population-level behavioral asymmetries.",

In the study, we divided the behaviors into abnormal and normal behavioral traits which were further divided into self-directed and social interchange behaviors.

Animals who were born in a zoo or confiscated from another zoo showed higher levels of abnormal behaviors. The results of this study discuss the range of behavioral patterns displayed by the captive animals, discuss the causal factors for the behavioral pathogens, and further suggests feasible solutions to increase the welfare of these macaques. In the study, the early life history of the animal and the lack of social and environmental stimulus could be very critical for the development of behavioral pathogens.

    "abstract": "The male rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell-originated PC12 cell line can synthesize and release catecholamine neurotransmitters, and it has been widely used as a model system in cell biology and toxicology research. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is involved in the inactivation of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, and it is particularly important for theregulation of dopamine. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using PC12 cells as an in vitro drug screening platform to compare the activity of multiple COMT inhibitors. Incubation of PC12 cells with tolcapone, a highly potent and selective COMT inhibitor, increased the concentrations of dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) while reducing the metabolites 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cell culture medium. LIBD-3, a novel, non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor produced similar effects compared to tolcapone. LIBD-4, a less potent inhibitor, exhibited the expected right-shift in functional inhibition in the assay. These results match the known in vivo effects of COMT inhibition in rodents. Together, these data support the continued use of PC12 cells as an in vitro screen that bridges cell-free enzyme assays and more costly in vivo assays.",

    "abstract": "The key driver of breathing rhythm is the preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) whose activity is modulated by various categorical inputs, e.g., volitional, physiological, emotional. While the preBotC is highly interconnected with other regions of the breathing central pattern generator (bCPG) in the brainstem, there is no data about the direct projections to either excitatory and inhibitory preBotC subpopulations from other elements of the bCPG or from suprapontine regions. Using modified rabies tracing, we identified neurons throughout the brain that send monosynaptic projections to identified excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons. Within the brainstem, neurons from sites in the bCPG, including the contralateral preBotC, Botzinger Complex (BotC), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parafacial region (pFL/pFV or RTN/pFRG), and parabrachial nuclei, send direct projections to both excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons. Suprapontine inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons include the superior colliculus, red nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex; these projections represent potential direct pathways for volitional, emotional, and physiological control of breathing.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that a number of learning processes are at play in visuomotor adaptation tasks. In addition to the presumed formation of an internal model of the perturbation, learners can also develop explicit knowledge allowing them to select better actions in responding to a given perturbation. Advances in visuomotor rotation experiments have underscored the important role that such \\\"explicit learning\\\" plays in shaping adaptation to kinematic perturbations. Yet, in adaptation to dynamic perturbations, its contribution has been largely overlooked, potentially because compensation of a viscous force field, for instance, is difficult to assess by commonly-used verbalization-based approaches. We therefore sought to assess the contribution of explicit learning in learners adapting to a dynamic perturbation by two novel modifications of a force field experiment. First, via an elimination approach, we asked learners to abandon any cognitive strategy before selected force channel trials to expose consciously accessible parts of overall learning. Learners indeed reduced compensatory force compared to standard Catch channels. Second, via a manual reporting approach, we instructed a group of learners to mimic their right hands adaptation by moving with their naive left hand. While a control group displayed negligible left-hand force compensation, the Mimic group reported forces that approximated right-hand adaptation but appeared to under-report the velocity component of the force field in favor of a more position-based component. We take these results to clearly demonstrate the contribution of explicit learning to force adaptation, underscoring its relevance to motor learning in general.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWhile the role of explicit learning has recently been appreciated in visuomotor adaptation tasks, their contribution to force field adaptation has not been as widely acknowledged. To address this issue, we employed two novel methods to assay explicit learning in force field adaptation tasks and found that learners can voluntarily control aspects of force production and manually report them with their untrained limb. This suggests that an explicit component contributes to force field adaptation and may provide alternative explanations to behavioral phenomena commonly thought to reveal a complex organization of internal models in the brain.",

    "abstract": "In multiple fixed interval schedules of reinforcement, different time intervals are signaled by different environmental stimuli which acquire control over behavior. Previous work has shown that temporal performance is controlled not only by external stimuli but also by temporal aspects of the task, depending on the order in which the different intervals are trained - intermixed across trials or in blocks of several trials. The aim of this study was to further describe the training conditions under which the stimuli acquire control over temporal performance. We manipulated the number of consecutive trials of each fixed interval (FI) per training block (Experiment I) and the number of FIs trained (Experiment II). The results suggest that when trained in blocks of several consecutive trials of the same FI, temporal performance is controlled by temporal regularities across trials and not by the visual stimuli that signal the FIs. One possible account for those data is that the temporal cues overshadow the visual stimuli for the control of temporal performance. Similar results have also been observed with humans, which suggest that temporal regularity overcomes the stimuli in the control of behavior in temporal tasks across species.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control, i.e., the ability to stop or suppress actions, thoughts, or memories, represents a prevalent and popular concept in basic and clinical neuroscience as well as psychology. At the same time, it is notoriously difficult to study as successful inhibition is characterized by the absence of a continuously quantifiable direct behavioral marker. It has been suggested that the P3 latency, and here especially its onset latency, may serve as neurophysiological marker of inhibitory control as it correlates with the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The SSRT estimates the average stopping latency, which itself is unobservable since no overt response is elicited in successful stop trials, based on differences in the distribution of go reaction times and the delay of the stop- relative to the go-signal in stop trials.\\n\\nIn a meta-analysis and an independent EEG experiment, we found that correlations between the P3-latency and the SSRT are indeed replicable, but also unspecific. Not only does the SSRT also correlate with the N2-latency, but both P3- and N2-latency measures show similar or even higher correlations with other behavioral parameters such as the go reaction time or stopping accuracy. The missing specificity of P3-SSRT correlations, together with the general pattern of associations, suggests that these manifest effects are driven by underlying latent processes other than inhibition, such as those associated with the speed-accuracy trade-off.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modifications are present in all organisms, but their exact functional roles and positions are yet to be fully characterized. Modified nucleotides have been implicated in the stabilization of RNA structure and regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. In some instances, rRNA modifications can confer antibiotic resistance. High-resolution ribosome structures are thus necessary for precise determination of modified nucleotides positions, a task that has previously been accomplished by X-ray crystallography. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Escherichia coli (E. coli) 50S subunit at an average resolution of 2.2[A] as an additional approach for mapping modification sites. Our structure confirms known modifications present in 23S rRNA and additionally allows for localization of Mg2+ ions and their coordinated water molecules. Using our cryo-EM structure as a testbed, we developed a program for identification of post-transcriptional rRNA modifications using a cryo-EM map. This program can be easily used on any RNA-containing cryo-EM structure, and an associated Coot plugin allows for visualization of validated modifications, making it highly accessible.",
