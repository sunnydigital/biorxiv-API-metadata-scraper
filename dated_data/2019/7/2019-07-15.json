    "abstract": "Anoxic subsurface sediments contain communities of heterotrophic microorganisms that metabolize organic carbon at extraordinarily slow rates. In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (D-phenylalanine and L-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on L-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.\\n\\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWBurial of organic carbon in marine and estuarine sediments represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Globally, [~]40% of organic carbon burial occurs in anoxic estuaries and deltaic systems. However, the ultimate controls on the amount of organic matter that is buried in sediments, versus oxidized into CO2, are poorly constrained. Here we used a combination of enzyme assays and metagenomic analysis to identify how subsurface microbial communities catalyze the first step of proteinaceous organic carbon degradation. Our results show that microbial communities in deeper sediments are adapted to access molecules characteristic of degraded organic matter, suggesting that those heterotrophs are adapted to life in the subsurface.",

    "abstract": "The readiness potential (RP)--a key ERP correlate of upcoming action--is known to precede subjects reports of their decision to move. Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions--purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action--especially the readiness potential--precede subjects reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions--e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but--critically--not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice. Hence, it challenges the generalizability of previous results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.",

    "abstract": "One of the basics and fundamentals problems in ecology is understand the factors that shape the spatial patterns in the distribution of the species and the coexistence of close relatives species. Among the most important factors governing the distributions and the coexistence of species are the spatiotemporal changes occurring in the microhabitat heterogeneity. Here, we assessed the heterogeneity of microhabitats and how they have an effect in the spatial segregation of two species of small mammals (i. e., Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis), which coexist in a temperate, mixed forest. We evaluated the microhabitat heterogeneity through multivariate statistics, using onto 23 habitat variables for vertical-horizontal habitat structure along pluvial seasons. To detect specific microdistribution changes and habitat preferences by two species of small mammals, we used second order spatial statistics and general linear models. According to their respective morphology and locomotive adaptations, the middle sized, midscansorial P. difficilis was resident all year long and preferred microhabitats with a high log ground cover, while the opportunistic, small sized, cursorial P. melanotis changed its occupancy area, depending on density of herbaceous and woody plants cover. Under the more benign microhabitat conditions of rainy season (denser plant coverage, milder temperature), both species showed closer microdistribution patterns; while these became repulsive at the less benign conditions of dry season (scarcer plant cover, colder temperature). Thus, we could confirm that seasonal changes of microhabitat heterogeneity promoted Peromyscus coexistence, through dispersion patterns reflecting partition of microhabitat resources.",

    "abstract": "Animal personality is considered to be developed through complex interactions of an individual with its surrounding environment. How can we quantify the  personality of an individual? Quantifying intra- and inter-individual variability of behavior, or individual behavioral type, appears to be a prerequisite in the study of animal personality. We propose a statistical method from a predictive point of view to measure the appropriateness of our assumption of  individual behavior in repeatedly measured behavioral data from several individuals. For a model case, we studied the sponge crab Lauridromia dehaani known to make and carry a  cap from a natural sponge for camouflage. Because a cap is most likely to be rebuilt and replaced repeatedly, we hypothesized that each individual crab would grow a unique behavioral type and it would be observed under an experimentally controlled environmental condition. To test the hypothesis, we conducted behavioral experiments and employed a new Bayesian model-based comparison method to examine whether crabs have individual behavioral types in the cap making behavior. Crabs were given behavioral choices by using artificial sponges of three different sizes. We modeled the choice of sponges, size of the trimmed part of a cap, size of the cavity of a cap, and the latency to produce a cap, as random variables in 26 models, including hierarchical models specifying the behavioral types. In addition, we calculated the marginal-level widely applicable information criterion (mWAIC) values for hierarchical models to evaluate and compared them with the non-hierarchical models from the predictive point of view. As a result, the crabs of less than about 9 cm in size were found to make caps from the sponges. The body size explained the behavioral variables namely, choice, trimmed cap characteristics, and cavity size, but not latency. Furthermore, we captured the behavioral type as a probabilistic distribution structure of the behavioral data by comparing WAIC. Our statistical approach is not limited to behavioral data but is also applicable to physiological or morphological data when examining whether some group structure exists behind fluctuating empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Roots are the main channel for water and nutrient uptake in plants. Optimisation of root architecture provides a viable strategy to improve nutrient and water uptake efficiency and maintain crop productivity under water-limiting and nutrient-poor conditions. We know little, however, about the genetic control of root development in wheat, a crop supplying 20% of global calorie and protein intake. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of seminal root development in wheat, we conducted a high-throughput screen for variation in seminal root number using an exome-sequenced mutant population derived from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Cadenza. The screen identified seven independent mutants with homozygous and stably altered seminal root number phenotypes. One mutant, Cadenza0900, displays a recessive extra seminal root number phenotype, while six mutants (Cadenza0062, Cadenza0369, Cadenza0393, Cadenza0465, Cadenza0818 and Cadenza1273) show lower seminal root number phenotypes most likely originating from defects in the formation and activation of seminal root primordia. Segregation analysis in F2 populations suggest that the phenotype of Cadenza0900 is controlled by multiple loci whereas the Cadenza0062 phenotype fits a 3:1 mutant:wild-type segregation ratio characteristic of dominant single gene action. This work highlights the potential to use the sequenced wheat mutant population as a forward genetic resource to uncover novel variation in agronomic traits, such as seminal root architecture.",

Only if outcomes are contingent on our choices can we make meaningful value-based decisions. Here, we investigate the effect of outcome contingency on the neural coding of rewards and tasks. Participants performed a reversal-learning task in which reward outcomes were contingent on trial-by-trial choices, and performed a  free choice task in which rewards were random and not contingent on choices. We hypothesized that contingent outcomes enhance the neural coding of rewards and tasks, which was tested using multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data. Reward outcomes were encoded in a large network including the striatum, dmPFC and parietal cortex, and these representations were indeed amplified for contingent rewards. Tasks were encoded in the dmPFC at the time of decision-making, and in parietal cortex in a subsequence maintenance phase. We found no evidence for contingency-dependent modulations of task signals, demonstrating highly similar coding across contingency conditions. Our findings suggest selective effects of contingency on reward coding only, and further highlight the role of dmPFC and parietal cortex in value-based decision-making, as these were the only regions strongly involved in both reward and task coding.",

    "abstract": "Preterm birth (PTB) is leading contributor to infant death in the United States and globally, yet the underlying mechanistic causes are not well understood. Histopathological studies of preterm birth suggest advanced villous maturity may have a role in idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth (isPTB). To better understand pathological and molecular basis of isPTB, we compared placental villous transcriptomes from carefully phenotyped cohorts of PTB due to infection or isPTB between 28-36 weeks gestation and healthy term placentasu. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a unique expression signature for isPTB distinct from the age-matched controls that were delivered prematurely due to infection. This signature included the upregulation of three IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6), supporting a role for aberrant IGF signaling in isPTB. However, within the isPTB expression signature, we detected secondary signature of inflammatory markers including TNC, C3, CFH, and C1R, which have been associated with placental maturity. In contrast, the expression signature of the gestational age-matched infected samples included upregulation of proliferative genes along with cell cycling and mitosis pathways. Together, these data suggest an isPTB molecular signature of placental hypermaturity, likely contributing to the premature activation of inflammatory pathways associated with birth and providing a molecular basis for idiopathic spontaneous birth.",

    "abstract": "Complex traits are known to be influenced by a combination of environmental factors and rare and common genetic variants. However, detection of such multivariate associations can be compromised by low statistical power and confounding by population structure. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) can account for correlations due to relatedness but have not been applicable in high-dimensional (HD) settings where the number of fixed effect predictors greatly exceeds the number of samples. False positives or false negatives can result from two-stage approaches, where the residuals estimated from a null model adjusted for the subjects relationship structure are sub-sequently used as the response in a standard penalized regression model. To overcome these challenges, we develop a general penalized LMM with a single random effect called ggmix for simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for population structure in high dimensional prediction models. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection which is highly scalable, computationally efficient and has theoretical guarantees of convergence. Through simulations and three real data examples, we show that ggmix leads to more parsimonious models compared to the two-stage approach or principal component adjustment with better prediction accuracy. Our method performs well even in the presence of highly correlated markers, and when the causal SNPs are included in the kinship matrix. ggmix can be used to construct polygenic risk scores and select instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies. Our algorithms are available in an R package (https://github.com/greenwoodlab/ggmix).\n\n1 Author SummaryThis work addresses a recurring challenge in the analysis and interpretation of genetic association studies: which genetic variants can best predict and are independently associated with a given phenotype in the presence of population structure ? Not controlling confounding due to geographic population structure, family and/or cryptic relatedness can lead to spurious associations. Much of the existing research has therefore focused on modeling the association between a phenotype and a single genetic variant in a linear mixed model with a random effect. However, this univariate approach may miss true associations due to the stringent significance thresholds required to reduce the number of false positives and also ignores the correlations between markers. We propose an alternative method for fitting high-dimensional multivariable models, which selects SNPs that are independently associated with the phenotype while also accounting for population structure. We provide an efficient implementation of our algorithm and show through simulation studies and real data examples that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and controlling the false discovery rate.",

    "abstract": "The selection pressure exerted by herbicides has led to the repeated evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds. The evolution of herbicide resistance on contemporary timescales in turn provides an outstanding opportunity to investigate key questions about the genetics of adaptation, in particular, the relative importance of adaptation from new mutations, standing genetic variation, or geographic spread of adaptive alleles through gene flow. Glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus tuberculatus poses one of the most significant threats to crop yields in the midwestern United States (1), with both agricultural populations and herbicide resistance only recently emerging in Canada (2, 3). To understand the evolutionary mechanisms driving the spread of resistance, we sequenced and assembled the A. tuberculatus genome and investigated the origins and population genomics of 163 resequenced glyphosate-resistant and susceptible individuals from Canada and the USA. In Canada, we discovered multiple modes of convergent evolution: in one locality, resistance appears to have evolved through introductions of preadapted US genotypes, while in another, there is evidence for the independent evolution of resistance on genomic backgrounds that are historically non-agricultural. Moreover, resistance on these local, non-agricultural backgrounds appears to have occurred predominantly through the partial sweep of a single haplotype. In contrast, resistant haplotypes arising from the midwestern US show multiple amplification haplotypes segregating both between and within populations. Therefore, while the remarkable species-wide diversity of A. tuberculatus has facilitated geographic parallel adaptation of glyphosate resistance, more recently established agricultural populations are limited to adaptation in a more mutation-limited framework.\\n\\nSignificanceWhile evolution is often thought of as playing out over millions of years, adaptation to new enviroments can occur in real time, presenting key opportunities to understand evolutionary processes. An important example comes from agriculture, where many weeds have evolved herbicide resistance. We have studied glyphosate resistant Amaranthus tuberculatus, a significant threat to crop yields in the midwestern US and Canada. Genome analyses showed that rapid evolution can either occur by \\\"borrowing\\\" resistance alleles from other locations, or by de novo evolution of herbicide resistance in a genetic background that was not previously associated with agriculture. Differences in recent evolutionary histories have thus favored either adaptation from pre-existing variation or new mutation in different parts of the A. tuberculatus range.",

    "abstract": "The central dogma of molecular biology rests on two kinds of asymmetry between genomes and enzymes: informatic asymmetry, where information flows from genomes to enzymes but not from enzymes to genomes; and catalytic asymmetry, where enzymes provide chemical catalysis but genomes do not. How did these asymmetries originate? Here we show that these asymmetries can spontaneously arise from conflict between selection at the molecular level and selection at the cellular level. We developed a model consisting of a population of protocells, each containing a population of replicating catalytic molecules. The molecules are assumed to face a trade-off between serving as catalysts and serving as templates. This trade-off causes conflicting multilevel selection: serving as catalysts is favoured by selection between protocells, whereas serving as templates is favoured by selection between molecules within protocells. This conflict induces informatic and catalytic symmetry breaking, whereby the molecules differentiate into genomes and enzymes, establishing the central dogma. We show mathematically that the symmetry breaking is caused by a positive feedback between Fishers reproductive values and the relative impact of selection at different levels. This feedback induces a division of labour between genomes and enzymes, provided variation at the molecular level is sufficiently large relative to variation at the cellular level, a condition that is expected to hinder the evolution of altruism. Taken together, our results suggest that the central dogma is a logical consequence of conflicting multilevel selection.",

    "abstract": "The Alternaria section alternaria (A. alternata species group) represents a diverse group of saprophytes, human allergens and plant pathogens. Alternaria taxonomy has benefited from recent phylogenetic revision but the basis of differentiation between major phylogenetic clades within the group is not yet understood. Furthermore, genomic resources have been limited for the study of host-specific pathotypes. We report near complete genomes of the apple and Asian pear pathotypes as well as draft assemblies for a further 10 isolates representing Alternaria tenuissima and Alternaria arborescens lineages. These assemblies provide the first insights into differentiation of these taxa as well as allowing the description of effector and non-effector profiles of apple and pear conditionally dispensable chromosomes (CDCs). We define the phylogenetic relationship between the isolates sequenced in this study and a further 23 Alternaria spp. based on available genomes. We determine which of these genomes represent MAT1-1-1 or MAT1-2-1 idiomorphs and designate host-specific pathotypes. We show for the first time that the apple pathotype is polyphyletic, present in both the A. arborescens and A. tenuissima lineages. Furthermore, we profile a wider set of 89 isolates for both mating type idiomorphs and toxin gene markers. Mating-type distribution indicated that gene flow has occurred since the formation of A. tenuissima and A. arborescens lineages. We also developed primers designed to AMT14, a gene from the apple pathotype toxin gene cluster with homologs in all tested pathotypes. These primers allow identification and differentiation of apple, pear and strawberry pathotypes, providing new tools for pathogen diagnostics.",

However, the entry, dispersal, and detection of terrestrial species DNA within waterbodies is understudied.\nC_LIO_LIWe evaluated eDNA metabarcoding of pond water for monitoring semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, and arboreal mammals, and examined spatiotemporal variation in mammal eDNA signals using experiments in captive and wild conditions.\nC_LIO_LIWe selected nine focal species of conservation and management concern: European water vole, European otter, Eurasian beaver, European hedgehog, European badger, red deer, Eurasian lynx, red squirrel, and European pine marten. We hypothesised that eDNA signals (i.e. proportional read counts) would be stronger for semi-aquatic than terrestrial species, and at sites where mammals exhibited behaviours (e.g. swimming, urination). We tested this by sampling waterbodies in enclosures of captive focal species at specific sites where behaviours had been observed ( directed sampling) and at equidistant intervals along the shoreline ( stratified sampling). We then surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers.\nC_LIO_LIAll focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between species lifestyles (i.e. semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, arboreal), or according to behaviours. Therefore, eDNA was evenly distributed within artificial waterbodies. Conversely, eDNA was unevenly distributed in natural ponds. eDNA metabarcoding, camera trapping, and field signs detected beaver, red deer, and roe deer. Badger and red fox were recorded with cameras and field signs, but not eDNA metabarcoding. However, eDNA metabarcoding detected small mammals missed by cameras and field signs, e.g. water vole. Terrestrial mammal eDNA signals were weaker and detected in fewer samples than semi-aquatic mammal eDNA signals.\nC_LIO_LIeDNA metabarcoding has potential for inclusion in mammal monitoring schemes by enabling large-scale, multi-species distribution assessment for priority and difficult to survey species, and could provide early indication of range expansions or contractions. However, eDNA surveys need high spatiotemporal resolution and metabarcoding biases require further investigation before this tool is routinely implemented.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Synthetic gene circuits perturb the physiology of their cellular host. The extra load on endogenous processes shifts the equilibrium of resource allocation in the host, leading to slow growth and reduced biosynthesis. Here we built integrated host-circuit models to quantify growth defects caused by synthetic gene circuits. Simulations reveal a complex relation between circuit output and cellular capacity for gene expression. For weak induction of heterologous genes, protein output can be increased at the expense of growth defects. Yet for stronger induction, cellular capacity reaches a tipping point, beyond which both gene expression and growth rate drop sharply. Extensive simulations across various growth conditions and large regions of the design space suggest that the critical capacity is a result of ribosomal scarcity. We studied the impact of growth defects on various gene circuits and transcriptional logic gates, which highlights the extent to which cellular burden can limit, shape and even break down circuit function. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework to assess the impact of host-circuit interactions in silico, with wide-ranging implications for the design and optimization of bacterial gene circuits.",

Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 1/3 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. In this paper, we explore an alternative methodology based on deep learning that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional annotations across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish rigorous benchmark assessments that use both random and clustered data splits to control for potentially confounding sequence similarities between train and test sequences. Using Pfam full, we report convolutional networks that are significantly more accurate and computationally efficient than BLASTp, while learning sequence features such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.\n\nSignificance StatementFrom the psychophysical and computational points of view, the present study tried to answer the question, \"how do human observers see deformation?\". In the psychophysical experiment, we used a clip wherein a bar dynamically deformed. We also tested the illusory deformation of a bar, which was caused by tilted drifting grating, because it was unclear whether the illusory deformation could be described by our model. In the computational analysis, in order to explain psychophysical data for deformation perception, it was necessary to assume an additional unit monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses of MT cells that were sensitive to local image motion.",

The complex mosaic of changes in brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we demonstrate a function-based method for cross-species cortical alignment that leverages recent advances in understanding cortical organization and that enables the quantification of homologous regions across species, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, our method establishes that cross-species similarity in cortical organization decreases with geodesic distance from unimodal systems, and culminates in the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, as is seen in humans, is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation. They also highlight functional changes in regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus as key influences on uniquely human features of cognition.",

However, we have a limited understanding of how phenotypes respond to interactions with multiple taxa. We investigate how interactions with a network of prey species contribute to spatially structured variation in the skin toxins of the Neotropical poison frog Oophaga pumilio. Specifically, we assess how beta-diversity of alkaloid-bearing arthropod prey assemblages (68 ant species) and evolutionary divergence among populations (from a neutral genetic marker) contribute to frog poison dissimilarity (toxin profiles composed of 230 different lipophilic alkaloids sampled from 934 frogs at 46 sites). We show that ant assemblage turnover predicts alkaloid turnover and unique toxin combinations across the range of O. pumilio. By contrast, evolutionary relatedness is barely correlated with toxin variation. We discuss how the analytical framework proposed here can be extended to other multi-trophic systems, coevolutionary mosaics, microbial assemblages, and ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Coping with diabetes requires frequent and even today mostly invasive blood glucose-based monitoring. Partly due to this invasive nature and the associated reduced skin wound healing and increased risk of infection, non-invasive glucose monitoring technologies would represent considerable progress. Edited keratinocytes may enable such a function.\\n\\nTo address this hypothesis, we conducted a proteomic screen in the skin by making use of the experimental in vivo mouse model of type I diabetes alongside controls. We identified Trisk 95 as the only protein whose expression is induced in response to high blood glucose. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that induction of Trisk 95 expression occurs not only at the protein level but also transcriptionally. This induction was associated with a marked elevation in the Fluo-4 signal, suggesting a role for intracellular calcium changes in the signalling cascade. Strikingly, these changes lead concurrently to fragmentation of the mitochondria. As judged from the knockout findings, both the calcium flux and the mitochondrial phenotype were dependent on Trisk 95 function, since the phenotypes in question were abolished.\\n\\nThe data demonstrate that the skin represents an organ that reacts robustly and thus mirrors changes in systemic blood glucose levels. The findings are also consistent with a channelling model of Trisk 95 that serves as an insulin-independent but glucose-responsive biomarker taking part in releasing calcium from the cellular stores in the skin. The skin cells may thus provide a novel mean for glucose monitoring when analysing changes in labelled Trisk 95 and calcium. By that, this study is the first proof of the concept of our registered patent (No. PCT FI2016/050917), which proposes the use of cells as biosensors for developing personalized health-monitoring devices.",

    "abstract": "Pertussis resurgence worldwide calls for new prevention strategies, as the recently incorporated vaccine booster dose during pregnancy, whose aim is to protect newborns from infection. In Brazil, maternal Tdap vaccination is recommended since 2014, and we reported that this strategy promotes high transplacental transfer of anti-PT IgG and it is effective in protecting infants early in life. Young children are the most susceptible group and with higher mortality rates, however, it is not well known whether the elicited anti-pertussis maternal antibodies could influence in the childrens immune responses further in life, especially after their own vaccination against pertussis. Considering this scenario, we conducted a study with children born to mothers who either received or not the booster dose during pregnancy, after their primary pertussis vaccination, in order to investigate the first impact of maternal immunisation on the response to infant immunisation regarding the cellular immune response, while comparing with data from the literature. As transfer of maternal antibodies could result in attenuation of the immune response to vaccination in infants, this study performed to determine whether higher levels of maternal antibodies could influence in the immune response of infants to the whole-pertussis vaccination series. Results showed no difference in cytokine production between groups, a first suggestion that maternal vaccination may not interfere with recognition and cellular response generation to vaccination. This data, together with humoral immunity and epidemiological studies, is important for the implementation of maternal immunisation strategies nationwide and will contribute to assure public policies regarding vaccination schemes.\\n\\nImportancePertussis, or whopping cough, is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a bacterial agent, resulting in violent coughs and possibly death in vulnerable groups, such as young children and neonates. It is known that pregnant mothers transfer antibodies to their developing foetuses for protection in early life, however anti-pertussis antibodies are not highly detected in young children. Thus, a pertussis maternal vaccination was implemented to increase maternal anti-pertussis antibodies levels in pregnant women and therefore the transference to the foetus. However, maternal antibodies can also interfere in the child immune response in the first months of life. The significance of our research is in analysing the cellular immune response of children born from pertussis-vaccinated mothers, which will give a first glimpse on how maternal antibodies could modulate the childs response to pertussis in early life.",

    "abstract": "Proper control of gene expression levels upon various perturbations is a fundamental aspect of cellular robustness. Protein-level dosage compensation is one mechanism buffering perturbations to stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes through accelerated proteolysis of unassembled subunits. Although N-terminal acetylation- and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation by the Ac/N-end rule pathway enables selective compensation of excess subunits, it is unclear how dominant this pathway contributes to stoichiometry control. Here we report that dosage compensation depends only partially on the Ac/N-end rule pathway. Our analysis of genetic interactions between 18 subunits and 10 quality control factors in budding yeast demonstrated that multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and N-acetyltransferases are involved in dosage compensation. We find that N-acetyltransferases-mediated compensation is not simply predictable from N-terminal sequence despite their sequence specificity for N-acetylation. We also find that the compensation of Pop3 and Bet4 is due in large part to a minor N-acetyltransferase NatD. Furthermore, canonical NatD substrates histone H2A/H4 were compensated even in its absence, suggesting N-acetylation-independent compensation. Our study reveals the complexity and robustness of the stoichiometry control system.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor rotations are frequently used to study the different processes underlying motor adaptation. Explicit aiming strategies and implicit recalibration are two of these processes. Various methods, which differ in their underlying assumptions, have been used to dissociate the two processes. Direct methods, such as verbal reports, assume explicit knowledge to be verbalizable, where indirect methods, such as the exclusion, assume that explicit knowledge is controllable. The goal of this study was thus to directly compare verbal reporting with exclusion in two different conditions: during consistent reporting and during intermittent reporting. Our results show that our two conditions lead to a dissociation between the measures. In the consistent reporting group, all measures showed similar results. However, in the intermittent reporting group, verbal reporting showed more explicit re-aiming and less implicit adaptation than exclusion. Curiously, when exclusion was measured again, after the end of learning, the differences were no longer apparent. We suspect this may reflect selective decay in implicit adaptation, as has been reported previously. All told, our results clearly indicate that methods of measurement can affect the amount of explicit re-aiming and implicit adaptation that is measured. Since it has been previously shown that both explicit re-aiming and implicit adaptation have multiple components, discrepancies between these different methods may arise because different measures reflect different components.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor rotations are frequently used to study the different processes underlying motor adaptation. Explicit aiming strategies and implicit recalibration are two of these processes. Various methods, which differ in their underlying assumptions, have been used to dissociate the two processes. Direct methods, such as verbal reports, assume explicit knowledge to be verbalizable, where indirect methods, such as the exclusion, assume that explicit knowledge is controllable. The goal of this study was thus to directly compare verbal reporting with exclusion in two different conditions: during consistent reporting and during intermittent reporting. Our results show that our two conditions lead to a dissociation between the measures. In the consistent reporting group, all measures showed similar results. However, in the intermittent reporting group, verbal reporting showed more explicit re-aiming and less implicit adaptation than exclusion. Curiously, when exclusion was measured again, after the end of learning, the differences were no longer apparent. We suspect this may reflect selective decay in implicit adaptation, as has been reported previously. All told, our results clearly indicate that methods of measurement can affect the amount of explicit re-aiming and implicit adaptation that is measured. Since it has been previously shown that both explicit re-aiming and implicit adaptation have multiple components, discrepancies between these different methods may arise because different measures reflect different components.",

    "abstract": "Co-production of two or more desirable compounds from low-cost substrates by a single microbial catalyst could greatly improve the economic competitiveness of many biotechnological processes. However, reports demonstrating the adoption of such co-production strategy are still scarce. In this study, the ability of genome-edited strain Psudomonas putida EM42 to simultaneously valorise D-xylose and D-cellobiose -two important lignocellulosic carbohydrates -by converting them into the platform chemical D-xylonic acid and medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoates, respectively, was investigated. Biotransformation experiments performed with P. putida resting cells showed that promiscuous periplasmic glucose oxidation route can efficiently generate extracellular xylonate with high yield reaching 0.97 g per g of supplied xylose. Xylose oxidation was subsequently coupled to the growth of P. putida with cytoplasmic {beta}-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca on D-cellobiose. This disaccharide turned out to be a better co-substrate for xylose-to-xylonate biotransformation than monomeric glucose. This was because unlike glucose, cellobiose did not block oxidation of the pentose by periplasmic glucose dehydrogenase Gcd, but, similarly to glucose, it was a suitable substrate for polyhydroxyalkanoate formation in P. putida. Co-production of extracellular xylose-born xylonate and intracellular cellobiose-born medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoates was established in proof-of-concept experiments with P. putida grown on the disaccharide. This study highlights the potential of P. putida EM42 as a microbial platform for the production of xylonic acid, identifies cellobiose as a new substrate for mcl-PHA production, and proposes a fresh strategy for the simultaneous valorisation of xylose and cellobiose.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the immediate and long-term evolutionary consequences of human-mediated hybridization is of major concern for conservation biology. Several studies have documented how selection in interaction with recombination modulates introgression at a genome-wide scale, but few have considered the dynamics of this process within and between chromosomes. Here, we used an exploited freshwater fish, the Brook Charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) for which decades of stocking practices have resulted in admixture between wild populations and an introduced domestic strain to assess both the temporal dynamics and local chromosomal variation in domestic ancestry. We provide a detailed picture of the domestic ancestry patterns across the genome using about 33,000 mapped SNPs genotyped in 611 individuals from 24 supplemented populations. For each lake, we distinguished early and late-generation hybrids using admixture tracts information. To assess the selective outcomes following admixture we then evaluated the relationship between recombination and admixture proportions at three different scales: the whole genome, chromosomes and within 2Mb windows. This allowed us to detect the signature of varied evolutionary mechanisms, as reflected by the finding of genomic regions where the introgression of domestic haplotypes are favored or disfavored. Among these, the main factor modulating local ancestry was likely the presence of deleterious recessive mutations in the wild populations, which can be efficiently hidden to selection in the presence of long admixture tracts. Overall, our results emphasize the relevance of taking into consideration local ancestry information to assess both the temporal and chromosomal variation in local ancestry toward better understanding post-hybridization evolutionary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to apply machine learning techniques to an automated epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals to help neurologists in a time-consuming diagnostic process. We employ two approaches based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to provide a probability of seizure occurrence in a windowed EEG recording of 18 channels. In order to extract relevant features based on time, frequency, and time-frequency domains for these networks, we consider an improvement of the Bayesian error rate from a baseline. Features of which the improvement rates are higher than the significant level are considered. These dominant features extracted from all EEG channels are concatenated as the input for ANN with 7 hidden layers, while the input of CNN is taken as raw multi-channel EEG signals. Using multi-concept of deep CNN in image processing, we exploit 2D-filter decomposition to handle the signal in spatial and temporal domains. Our experiments based on CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database showed that both ANN and CNN were able to perform with the overall accuracy of up to 99.07% and F1-score of up to 77.04%. ANN with dominant features is more capable of detecting seizure events than CNN whereas CNN requiring no feature extraction is slightly better than ANN in classification accuracy.",

This practice may entail severe consequences for physical and mental health in this population. Research on the subject is scarce. The aim of our study was to describe the psychopathological background of a sample of HIV positive MSM who practiced slamsex during the previous year and compare the physical and psychological symptoms between these participants and those who practiced sexualized drug use (SDU) or chemsex without slamsex.\\n\\nDesign and MethodsParticipants (HIV-positive MSM) were recruited from the U-Sex study in 22 HIV clinics in Madrid during 2016-17. All participants completed an anonymous cross-sectional survey on sexual behaviour and recreational drug use. The present analysis is based on HIV-positive MSM who had practiced SDU.\\n\\nResultsThe survey sample comprised 742 participants. Of all the participants who completed the survey, 216 (29.1%) practiced chemsex, and of these, 34 (15.7%) had practiced slamsex. Participants who practiced slamsex were more likely to have current psychopathology (depression, anxiety and drug related disorders) than chemsex users. In addition, participants who practiced slamsex had more high-risk sexual behaviours, polydrug use and were more often diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and hepatitis C than those who did not inject drugs. Compared with patients who did not inject drugs, patients who engaged in slamsex showed more severe drug related symptoms (withdrawal and dependence), symptoms of severe intoxication (loss of consciousness), and severe psychopathological symptoms related to SDU, such as paranoid thoughts and suicidal behaviour.\\n\\nConclusionSlamsex (intravenous SDU) is closely associated with current psychiatric disorders and severe drug-related and psychiatric symptoms.",

They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved.\\n\\nHere we introduce ARRIVE 2019. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise the items and split the guidelines into two sets, the ARRIVE Essential 10, which constitute the minimum requirement, and the Recommended Set, which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers to verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document that serves 1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, 2) to clarify key concepts and 3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim through these changes to help ensure that researchers, reviewers and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.",

However, previous studies have the weakness in reliability of single-cell-origin of the colonies. The present study aims to apply an alternative method to obtain clonal dental pulp cells with increased reliability of single cell origin. Dental pulp cells were cultured from 13 human wisdom teeth. Primary cultures of 3 human benign tumors were included as comparison. Cells were seeded into wells of a 96-plate at a mean density of 1 cell/well. On the next day, wells were inspected one by one to identify wells with single cells which were followed for 3 weeks. Survived clones were expanded and further characterized. Single cells were observed in all cases, the number of single-cell-wells varied from 16 to 33. Three weeks later, survived and grown clonal cells were observed in 10 to 29 wells, giving surviving rates of 33-91%. By contrast, though single tumor cells were also observed, none of them survived. Expanded clones exhibited diversity in viability and osteogenic differentiation which also differed from their parental cells. Seeding cells at clonal density into physically separated compartments like wells in a 96 plate and comprehensive observation provides a practical strategy for increasing reliability of single-cell origin of clonal cells. Cellular heterogeneity seems to be an intrinsic feature of dental pulp cells.",

    "abstract": "Many freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and particularly Mediterranean ones, show increasing levels of salinity. This changes in water conditions could affect abundance and distribution of inhabiting species as well as the provision of ecosystem services. In this study we conduct laboratory experiments using the macroinvertebrate Smicridea annulicornis as a model organism. Our factorial experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of geographical origin on organisms and salinity levels on survival and behavioral responses of caddisflies. The experimental organisms were captured from rivers belonging to three hydrological basins along a 450 Km latitudinal gradient in the Mediterranean region of Chile. Animals were exposed to three conductivity levels, from 180 to 1400 S/cm, close to the historical averages of the source rivers. We measured the behavioral responses to experimental stimulii and the survival time. Our results showed that geography origin shaped the behavioral and survival responses to salinity. In particular, survival and activity decreased more strongly with increasing salinity in organisms coming from more dilute waters. This suggests local adaptation to be determinant for salinity responses in this species of benthic invertebrate. In the current scenario of fast temporal and spatial changes in water levels and salt concentration, the conservation of geographic intra-specific variation of aquatic species is crucial for lowering the risk of salinity-driven biodiversity loss.",

    "abstract": "Modern electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging techniques have revealed a diverse spectrum of spatiotemporal neural activities underlying fundamental cognitive processing. Oscillations, traveling waves and other complex population dynamical patterns are often concomitant with sensory processing, information transfer, decision making and memory consolidation. While neural population models such as neural mass, population density and kinetic theoretical models have been used to capture a wide range of the experimentally observed dynamics, a full account of how the multi-scale dynamics emerges from the detailed biophysical properties of individual neurons and the network architecture remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework for reduced-dimensional descriptions of neuronal networks to model visual cortical dynamics. We show that, without introducing any new parameters, how a sequence of models culminating in an augmented system of spatially-coupled ODEs can effectively model a wide range of the observed cortical dynamics, ranging from visual stimulus orientation dynamics to traveling waves induced by visual illusory stimuli. In addition to an efficient simulation method, this framework also offers an analytic approach to studying large-scale network dynamics. As such, the dimensional reduction naturally leads to mesoscopic variables that capture the interplay between neuronal population stochasticity and network architecture that we believe to underlie many emergent cortical phenomena.",

This study aimed to evaluate the species composition of sand flies in located caves at Moeda Sul (MS) and Parque Estadual Serra do Rola Moca (PESRM), in southeastern Brazil at region of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, state of Minas Gerais. The collections of sand flies were performed with automatic light traps. Were used the Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling based on dissimilarity matrix calculated with the Jaccard index and Multivariate Analysis of Permutation to evaluate similarity of the species composition of sand flies among entrance, interior, and surroundings environments of each sampled cave at MS and PESRM, and thus to infer biological mechanisms from the patterns of distribution of sand flies among these different cave environments. A total of 375 phlebotomine sand flies were collected from six genera and 14 species. The most abundant species were Evandromyia tupynambai (54.7%), Brumptomyia troglodytes (25.6%), Evandromyia edwardsi, (6.1%) Psathyromyia brasiliensis (4.8%) and Lutzomyia longipalpis (4.3%).

    "abstract": "While it has been well-recognized that T-cell mediated adaptive cellular immunity plays important roles in cancer immune response and tumor control, the roles of B lymphocytes in tumor development and therapy have only been proposed until recently, and are still mostly controversial. To gain mechanistic insights into the origin and dynamics of tumor infiltrated immune cells, especially B lymphocytes, we combine single-cell RNA-sequencing and antigen receptor lineage analysis to characterize a large number of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) infiltrated immune cells and present a comprehensive atlas of infiltrated B-lymphocytes in TNBC, the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. We demonstrate that TNBC infiltrated B cells showed more mature and memory B cell characteristics, as well as high clonality and extensive IgH class switching recombination and somatic hypermutations. The B cell signatures based on single-cell RNA-seq results are significantly associated with improved survival for TNBC patients and provide better prognostication than classic single B cell markers (CD19 or CD20). Further dissection of the mechanisms regulating the functions and dynamic distribution of tumor infiltrated B cell populations will provide new clues for tumor immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen that can impact domestic sheep (Ovis aries; DS) and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis; BHS). Experimental and field data have indicated BHS are more susceptible than DS to developing polymicrobial pneumonia associated with Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae infection. We hypothesized that DS and BHS have a differential immunopathologic pulmonary response to M. ovipneumoniae infection. A retrospective study was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue from DS and BHS without and with M. ovipneumoniae detected in the lung tissue (n=8 per group). While each M. ovipneumoniae positive lung sample had microscopic changes typical of infection, including hyperplasia of intrapulmonary bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and respiratory epithelium, DS exhibited a more robust and well-organized BALT formation as compared to BHS. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies reactive in FFPE tissues and specific for leukocyte and cytokine markers: T cell marker CD3, B cell markers CD20 and CD79a, macrophage markers CD163 and Iba1, and cytokine IL-17. Digital analysis was used to quantitate chromogen deposition in regions of interest (ROIs), including alveolar and bronchiolar areas, and bronchiolar subregions (epithelium and BALT). Main effects and interaction of species and infection status were analyzed by beta regression and Bonferroni corrections were performed on pairwise comparisons (PBon<0.05 significance). Significant species differences were identified for bronchiolar CD3 (PBon=0.0023) and CD163 (PBon=0.0224), alveolar CD163 (PBon=0.0057), and for IL-17 in each of the ROIs (alveolar: PBon=0.0009; BALT: PBon=0.0083; epithelium: PBon=0.0007). Infected BHS had a higher abundance of bronchiolar CD3 (PBon=0.0005) and CD163 (PBon=0.0162), and alveolar CD163 (PBon=0.0073). While IL-17 significantly increased with infection in BHS BALT (PBon=0.0179) and alveolar (0.0006) ROIs, abundance in DS showed an insignificant decrease in these ROIs and a significant decrease in epithelial abundance (PBon=0.0019). These findings support the hypothesis that DS and BHS have a differential immunopathologic response to M. ovipneumoniae infection.",

This study evaluated a common variant (CV) in the human TAAR1 gene, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) V288V, to determine the involvement of TAAR1 in MA dependence.\\n\\nMETHODSParticipants (n = 106) with active MA dependence (MA-ACT), in remission from MA dependence (MA-REM), with active polysubstance dependence, in remission from polysubstance dependence, and with no history of substance dependence completed neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires and provided blood samples. In vitro expression and function of CV and wild type TAAR1 receptors were also measured.\\n\\nRESULTSThe V288V polymorphism demonstrated a 40% increase in TAAR1 protein expression in cell culture, but message sequence and protein function were unchanged, suggesting an increase in translation efficiency. Principal components analysis resolved neuropsychiatric symptoms into four components, PC1 (depression, anxiety, memory, and fatigue), PC2 (pain), PC3 (drug and alcohol craving), and PC4 (sleep disturbances). Analyses of study group and TAAR1 genotype revealed a significant interaction for PC3 (craving response) (p = 0.003). The control group showed no difference in PC3 associated with TAAR1, while adjusted mean craving for the MA-ACT and MA-REM groups, among those with at least one copy of V288V, was estimated to be, respectively, 1.55 (p = 0.036) and 1.77 (p = 0.071) times the adjusted mean craving for those without the TAAR1 SNP.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSNeuroadaptation to chronic MA use may be altered by TAAR1 genotype and result in increased dopamine signaling and craving in individuals with the V288V genotype.",

    "abstract": "Brucella species are facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacteria relevant to animal and human health. Their ability to establish an intracellular niche and subvert host cell pathways to their advantage depends on the delivery of bacterial effector proteins through a type IV secretion system. Brucella Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR)-domain-containing proteins BtpA (also known as TcpB) and BtpB are among such effectors. Although divergent in primary sequence, they interfere with Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling to inhibit the innate immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms implicated still remain unclear. To gain insight into the functions of BtpA and BtpB, we expressed them in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a eukaryotic cell model. We found that both effectors were cytotoxic and that their respective TIR domains were necessary and sufficient for yeast growth inhibition. Growth arrest was concomitant with actin depolymerization, endocytic block and a general decrease in kinase activity in the cell, suggesting a failure in energetic metabolism. Indeed, levels of ATP and NAD+ were low in yeast cells expressing BtpA and BtpB TIR domains, consistent with the recently described enzymatic activity of some TIR domains as NAD+ hydrolases. In human epithelial cells, both BtpA and BtpB expression reduced intracellular total NAD levels. In infected cells, both BtpA and BtpB contributed to reduction of total NAD, indicating that their NAD+ hydrolase functions are active intracellularly during infection. Overall, combining the yeast model together with mammalian cells and infection studies our results show that BtpA and BtpB modulate energy metabolism in host cells through NAD+ hydrolysis, assigning a novel role for these TIR domain-containing effectors in Brucella pathogenesis.",

Malassezia biofilm formation at the skin surface has not yet been addressed.\n\nObjectiveThe present study aimed to evaluate Malassezia interaction with a reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) model.\n\nMethodsMalassezia clinical isolates were previously isolated from volunteers with pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Yeasts of two strains of M. furfur and M. sympodialis were inoculated onto the SkinEthic RHE. The tissues were processed for light microscopy, wide-field fluorescence microscopy and scanning-electron microscopy.\n\nResultsColonization of the RhE surface with aggregates of Malassezia yeasts entrapped in a multilayer sheet with variable amount of extracellular matrix was unveiled by imaging techniques following 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of incubation. Whenever yeasts were suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with lipids, the biofilm substantially increased with a dense extracellular matrix in which the yeast cells were embedded (not seen in control samples). Slight differences were found in the biofilm architectural structure between the two tested species.\n\nConclusionSkin isolates of M. furfur and M. sympodialis were capable of forming biofilm in vitro at the epidermal surface simulating in vivo conditions. Following 24 hours of incubation, without added lipids, rudimental matrix was barely visible, conversely to the reported at plastic surfaces. The amount of biofilm apparently increased progressively from 48 to 96 hours. A structural heterogeneity of biofilm between species was found with higher entrapment by a denser and more gelatinous extracellular matrix in M. furfur biofilm.",

    "abstract": "Plastic residual film pollution in China is serious, and the use of degradable mulch film instead of plastic mulch can effectively alleviate this situation. The substitution of common polyethylene plastic mulch film with biodegradable mulch film in the agricultural production of cotton and maize in an arid region was investigated in the present study. Using bare soil as the control, we compared the effects of common polyethylene plastic film and biodegradable mulch film on crop growth, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) in maize and cotton. The results indicated that: (1) the biodegradable mulch film in this region remained intact for 60 days after being laid down, significantly degrading after 120 days, and was associated with increased soil temperature, moisture conservation, and degradability in comparison to a bare soil control. (2) Both the biodegradable mulch film and the polyethylene plastic film significantly increased various physiological parameters, such as crop height, stalk diameter, and leaf area. (3) The biodegradable mulch film significantly increased maize and cotton crop yield by 69.4-76.2% and 65.2-71.9%, respectively, compared to the bare soil control. (4) Compared to the bare soil control, the biodegradable mulch film effectively increased WUE in the crops by 64.5-73.1%. In summary, biodegradable mulch film had comparable results to the common polyethylene plastic film in increasing soil temperature, moisture conservation, crop growth, yield, and WUE. As the biodegradable mulch film causes no residual pollution, it is thus preferable to common plastic mulch film for agricultural applications in arid regions and supports the sustainable development of agroecosystems.",

Overdose of sodium pentobarbital (PB) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection is a widely accepted technique, but questions remain regarding pain associated with administration. As PB rapidly causes sedation and loss of consciousness, most studies have relied on indirect evidence of pain. The objective of this study was to assess pain associated with IP PB using an appropriate vehicle control.\\n\\nAdult male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) and female Wistar rats (N = 112) were block randomised by sex and strain to receive one of four treatments: 1) 800 mg/kg PB (pH 11); 2) 800 mg/kg PB with 4 mg/kg lidocaine (PB+lido); 3) saline or 4) vehicle controls (pH 11 or 12.5).

    "abstract": "The immunoglobulin type G (IgG) Fc N-glycans are known to modulate the interaction with membrane-bound Fc {gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs), fine-tuning the antibodys effector function in a sequence-dependent manner. Particularly interesting in this respect are the roles of galactosylation, which levels are linked to autoimmune conditions and aging, of core fucosylation, which is known to reduce significantly the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and of sialylation, which also reduces ADCC but only in the context of core-fucosylation. In this work we provide an atomistic level perspective through enhanced sampling computer simulations, based on replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), to understand the molecular determinants linking the Fc N-glycans sequence to the observed IgG1 function. Our results indicate that the two symmetrically opposed N-glycans interact extensively through their core trimannose residues. At room temperature the terminal galactose on the (1-6) arm is restrained to the protein through a network of interactions that keep the arm outstretched, meanwhile the (1-3) arm extends towards the solvent where a terminal sialic acid remains fully accessible. We also find that the presence of core fucose interferes with the extended sialylated (1-3) arm, altering its conformational propensity and as a consequence of steric hindrance, significantly enhancing the Fc dynamics. Furthermore, structural analysis shows that the core fucose position within the Fc core obstructs the access of N162 glycosylated Fc{gamma}Rs very much like a \\\"door-stop\\\", potentially decreasing the IgG/Fc{gamma}R binding free energy. All of these factors could represent important clues to understand at the molecular level the dramatic reduction of ADCC as a result of core fucosylation and provide an atomistic level-of-detail framework for the design of high potency IgG1 Fc N-glycoforms.",

    "abstract": "Rotaviruses (RV) cause acute severe diarrhea in the absence of substantial intestinal inflammation. They are also highly infectious in their homologous host species. The efficient replication capacity of RV in the small bowel is substantially linked to its ability to inhibit different types of interferons (IFNs). Here, we find that during RV infection in vitro, both virus-infected and uninfected bystander cells resist STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF7 induction in response to exogenous IFN. Functionally, cellular transcription in response to exogenous stimulation with IFN, but not intracellular dsRNA, was inhibited by RV. Further, IFNAR1 stimulation during RV infection significantly repressed a set of virus-induced transcripts. Regulation of IFN signaling in vivo was studied in suckling mice using the highly infectious homologous murine EW RV strain. Kinetic studies indicated that whereas sustained EW RV replication and IFN induction occurred in the small intestine, IFN-stimulated transcripts significantly decreased over time. In addition, LPS-mediated intestinal damage, driven by STAT1-induced inflammation, was prevented in EW RV-infected mice. Remarkably, ectopic stimulation of either IFNAR1 or IFNGR1 in murine RV-infected mice eliminated several intestinal antiviral and inflammatory transcriptional responses to RV. In contrast to homologous murine RV, infection with a STAT1-sensitive heterologous simian RV strain induced multiple IFN-stimulated transcripts, inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal expression of STAT1-pY701. Finally, RV strain-specific STAT1 regulation in the gut plays a prominent role in the activation of multiple intestinal caspases. On the other hand, the simian RRV strain, but not murine EW RV, uniquely triggers the cleavage of both extrinsic and intrinsic caspases (-8, -9, and -3) in a STAT1-mediated manner. Collectively, these findings reveal efficient re-programing of multiple IFN receptors in the gut towards a negative feedback mode of signaling, accompanied by suppression of IFN-mediated antiviral, apoptotic, and inflammatory functions, during natural RV intestinal infection.",

    "abstract": "1Priors and payoffs are known to affect perceptual decision-making, but little is understood about how they influence confidence judgments. For optimal perceptual decision-making, both priors and payoffs should be considered when selecting a response. However, for confidence to reflect the probability of being correct in a perceptual decision, priors should affect confidence but payoffs should not. To experimentally test whether human observers follow this normative behavior, we conducted an orientation-discrimination task with varied priors and payoffs, probing both perceptual and metacognitive decision-making. We then examined the placement of discrimination and confidence criteria according to several plausible Signal Detection Theory models. In the normative model, observers use the optimal discrimination criterion (i.e., the criterion that maximizes expected gain) and confidence criteria that shift with the discrimination criterion that maximizes accuracy (i.e., are not affected by payoffs). No observer was consistent with this model, with the majority exhibiting non-normative confidence behavior. One subset of observers ignored both priors and payoffs for confidence, always fixing the confidence criteria around the neutral discrimination criterion. The other group of observers incorrectly incorporated payoffs into their confidence by always shifting their confidence criteria with the same gains-maximizing criterion used for discrimination. Such metacognitive mistakes could have negative consequences outside the laboratory setting, particularly when priors or payoffs are not matched for all the possible decision alternatives.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs population aging progresses, volunteers in health field are expected to play a key role in health promotion and disease prevention, which may improve community residents health and well-being and at the same time help curve healthcare cost. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of self-oriented motives and altruistic motives as explanatory factors for Japanese Community Health Workers (CHWs) desire to continue their service. Unraveling the relative effects of these two types of motivation on CHW retention may lead to policy and practical implications for recruiting, training, and supporting CHWs in Japan. Haddad (2007) observed that citizens in Japan generally have a sense of governmental and individual responsibility for dealing with social problems. Applying these insights to CHWs, we hypothesize that altruistic motives have more potent influence on volunteers willingness to continue to serve than self-oriented motives.\\n\\nMethodsThree cities in Shiga prefecture, Japan agreed to participate in the study. Anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all CHWs who work in the three communities. The survey data were collected in March and April, 2013. A total of 417 questionnaires were mailed to CHWs, of which 346 were completed and returned (response rate 83.0%). Nine questionnaires missing response to the question concerning willingness to continue serving were removed from the analysis. The final analysis used 337 questionnaires (effective response rate 80.8%).\\n\\nResultsOne hundred ninety-nine (59.1%) of the respondents answered the question about willingness to continue CHW affirmatively, and 138 (40.9%) negatively. Controlling for other relevant factors, those with self-oriented motives in serving as CHWs were more likely to state they are willing to continue to serve (OR:1.54, confidence interval 1.00-2.37) than those without such motives. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effect of altruistic motives on respondents willingness to continue serving as CHWs was slightly larger than that of self-oriented motives; the odds ratio was 1.56(confidence interval 1.08-2.27).\\n\\nConclusionOne practical implication of the research is that learning more about the twin motives, self-oriented and altruistic, of volunteers and tailoring the content of CHW training to address those motives may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional and economic potentials of livestock systems are compromised by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. A major driver of resistance is the misuse and abuse of antimicrobial drugs. The likelihood of misuse may be elevated in low- and middle-income countries where limited professional veterinary services and laissez faire access to drugs are assumed to promote non-prudent practices (e.g., self-administration of drugs). The extent of these practices, as well as the knowledge and attitudes motivating them, are largely unknown within most agricultural communities in low- and middle-income countries. The main objective of this study was to document dimensions of knowledge, attitudes and practices related to antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in livestock systems and identify the livelihood factors associated with these dimensions. A mixed-methods ethnographic approach was used to survey households keeping layers in Ghana (N=110) and Kenya (N=76), pastoralists keeping cattle, sheep, and goats in Tanzania (N=195), and broiler farmers in Zambia (N=198), and Zimbabwe (N=298). Across countries, we find that it is individuals who live or work at the farm who draw upon their knowledge and experiences to make decisions regarding antimicrobial use and related practices. Input from animal health professionals is rare and antimicrobials are sourced at local, privately owned agrovet drug shops. We also find that knowledge, attitudes, and particularly practices significantly varied across countries, with poultry farmers holding more knowledge, desirable attitudes, and prudent practices compared to pastoralists households. Multivariate models showed that variation is related to several factors, including education, disease dynamics on the farm, and sources of animal health information. Study results emphasize that interventions to limit antimicrobial resistance must be founded upon a bottom-up understanding of antimicrobial use at the farm-level given limited input from animal health professionals and under-resourced regulatory capacities within most low- and middle-income countries. Establishing this bottom-up understanding across cultures and production systems will inform the development and implementation of the behavioral change interventions to combat AMR globally.",

These frameworks enable probabilistic models to be rapidly prototyped and fit to data using scalable approximation methods such as variational inference. In this work, we explore the use of the Stan language for probabilistic programming in application to phylogenetic models. We show that many commonly used phylogenetic models including the general time reversible (GTR) substitution model, rate heterogeneity among sites, and a range of coalescent models can be implemented using a probabilistic programming language. The posterior probability distributions obtained via the black box variational inference engine in Stan were compared to those obtained with reference implementations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for phylogenetic inference. We find that black box variational inference in Stan is less accurate than MCMC methods for phylogenetic models, but requires far less compute time. Finally, we evaluate a custom implementation of mean-field variational inference on the Jukes-Cantor substitution model and show that a specialized implementation of variational inference can be two orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than a general purpose probabilistic implementation.",

    "abstract": "Localization of proteins to a membrane is an essential step in a broad range of biological processes such as signaling, virion formation, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The strength and specificity of proteins binding to a membrane depend on the lipid composition. Single-particle reaction-diffusion methods offer a powerful tool for capturing lipid-specific binding to membrane surfaces by treating lipids explicitly as individual diffusible binding sites. However, modeling lipid particle populations is expensive. Here we present an algorithm for reversible binding of proteins to continuum surfaces with implicit lipids, providing dramatic speed-ups to many body simulations. Our algorithm can be readily integrated into most reaction-diffusion software packages. We characterize changes to kinetics that emerge from explicit versus implicit lipids as well as surface adsorption models, showing excellent agreement between our method and the full explicit lipid model. Compared to models of surface adsorption, which couple together binding affinity and lipid concentration, our implicit lipid model decouples them to provide more flexibility for controlling surface binding properties and lipid inhomogeneity, and thus reproducing binding kinetics and equilibria. Crucially, we demonstrate our methods application to membranes of arbitrary curvature and topology, modeled via a subdivision limit surface, again showing excellent agreement with explicit lipid simulations. Unlike adsorption models, our method retains the ability to bind lipids after proteins are localized to the surface (through e.g. a protein-protein interaction), which can greatly increase stability of multi-protein complexes on the surface. Our method will enable efficient cell-scale simulations involving proteins localizing to realistic membrane models, which is a critical step for predictive modeling and quantification of in vitro and in vivo dynamics.",

The MADCaP Array contains more than 1.5 million markers and an imputation backbone that successfully tags over 94% of common genetic variants in African populations. This array also has a high density of markers in genomic regions associated with cancer susceptibility, including 8q24.

We find that samples from Ghana and Nigeria cluster together, while samples from Senegal and South Africa yield distinct ancestry clusters.

    "abstract": "In rodents, waking firing patterns replay in NREM sleep during hippocampal sharpwave-ripples (HC-SWR), correlated with neocortical graphoelements (NC-GE). NC-GE include theta-bursts, spindles, downstates and upstates. In humans, consolidation during sleep is correlated with scalp-recorded spindles and down-upstates, but HC-SWR cannot be recorded non-invasively. Here we show in humans of both sexes that HC-SWR are highly correlated with NC-GE during NREM, with significantly more related HC-SWR/NC-GE for downstates or upstates than theta-bursts or spindles, in N2 than N3, in posterior than anterior HC, in frontal than occipital cortex, and ipsilaterally than contralaterally. The preferences interacted, e.g. frontal spindles co-occurred frequently with posterior HC-SWR in N2. These preferred GE, stages and locations for HC-SWR/NC-GE interactions may index selective consolidation activity, although that was not tested in this study. SWR recorded in different HC regions seldom co-occurred, and were related to GE in different cortical areas, showing that HC-NC interact in multiple transient, widespread but discrete, networks. NC-GE tend to occur with consistent temporal relationships to HC-SWR, and to each other. Cortical theta-bursts usually precede HC-SWR, where they may help define cortical input triggering HC-SWR firing. HC-SWR often follow cortical downstate onsets, surrounded by locally-decreased broadband power, suggesting a mechanism synchronizing cortical, thalamic and hippocampal activities. Widespread cortical upstates and spindles follow HC-SWR, consistent with the hypothesized contribution by hippocampal firing during HC-SWR to cortical firing-patterns during upstates and spindles. Overall, our results describe how hippocampal and cortical oscillations are coordinated in humans during events that are critical for memory consolidation in rodents.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHippocampal sharpwave-ripples, essential for memory consolidation, mark when hippocampal neurons replay waking firing patterns. In rodents, cortical sleep waves coordinate the transfer of temporary hippocampal to permanent cortical memories, but their relationship with human HC-SWR remains unclear. We show that human hippocampal sharpwave-ripples co-occur with all varieties of cortical sleep waves, in all cortical regions, and in all stages of Non-REM sleep but with overall preferences for each of these. We found that sharpwave-ripples in different parts of the hippocampus usually occurred independently of each other, and preferentially interacted with different cortical areas. We found that sharpwave-ripples typically occur after certain types of cortical waves, and before others, suggesting how the cortico-hippocampo-cortical interaction may be organized in time and space.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMinor QTLs mining has a very important role in genomic selection, pathway analysis and trait development in agricultural and biological research. Since most individual loci contribute little to complex trait variations, it remains a challenge for traditional statistical methods to identify minor QTLs with subtle phenotypic effects. Here we applied a new framework which combined the GWAS analysis and machine learning feature selection to explore new ways for the study of minor QTLs mining.\\n\\nResultsWe studied the soybean branching trait with the 2,137 accessions from soybean (Glycine max) diversity panel, which was sequenced by 50k SNP chips with 42,080 valid SNPs. First as a baseline study, we conducted the GWAS GAPIT analysis, and we found that only one SNP marker significantly associated with soybean branching was identified. We then combined the GWAS analysis and feature importance analysis with Random Forest score analysis and permutation analysis. Our analysis results showed that there are 36,077 features (SNPs) identified by Random Forest score analysis, and 2,098 features (SNPs) identified by permutation analysis. In total, there are 1,770 features (SNPs) confirmed by both of the Random Forest score analysis and the permutation analysis. Based on our analysis, 328 branching development related genes were identified. A further analysis on GO (gene ontology) term enrichment were applied on these 328 genes. And the gene location and gene expression of these identified genes were provided.\\n\\nConclusionsWe find that the combined analysis with GWAS and machine learning feature selection shows significant identification power for minor QTLs mining. The presented research results on minor QTLs mining will help understand the biological activities that lie between genotype and phenotype in terms of causal networks of interacting genes. This study will potentially contribute to effective genomic selection in plant breeding and help broaden the way of molecular breeding in plants.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are innate immune cells that acquire the capacity to suppress adaptive immune responses during cancer. It remains elusive how MDSCs differ from their normal myeloid counterparts, which limits our ability to specifically detect and therapeutically target MDSCs during cancer. Here, we used single-cell RNAseq to compare MDSC-containing splenic myeloid cells from breast tumor-bearing mice to wildtype controls. Our computational analysis of 14,646 single-cell transcriptomes reveals that MDSCs emerge through a previously unrealized aberrant neutrophil maturation trajectory in the spleen giving rise to a unique chemokine-responsive, immunosuppressive cell state that strongly differs from normal myeloid cells. We establish the first MDSC-specific gene signature and identify novel surface markers for improved detection and enrichment of MDSCs in murine and human samples. Our study provides the first single-cell transcriptional map defining the development of MDSCs, which will ultimately enable us to specifically target these cells in cancer patients.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe used single cell transcriptomics to identify the unique molecular features distinguishing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) from their normal, myeloid counterparts, which enabled us to reveal distinct transitory gene expression changes during their maturation in the spleen, and to identify novel cell surface markers for improved detection and isolation of MDSCs.",

    "abstract": "Gene flow is an enigmatic evolutionary force because it can limit adaptation but can also help populations escape inbreeding depression. Manipulating gene flow for conservation purposes is a controversial, but potentially powerful management strategy. We use multigenerational pedigrees and genomics to test demographic and evolutionary consequences of manipulating gene flow in two isolated wild Trinidadian guppy populations. We found that on average, hybrids lived longer and reproduced more. Despite overall genome-wide homogenization, alleles potentially associated with local adaptation were not entirely swamped by gene flow. Our results suggest that combining new genomic variation from immigrants with potentially adaptive variation from the recipient population resulted in highly fit hybrids and subsequent increases in population size. Contrary to the prevailing view that gene flow constrains adaptation, our study shows that immigration can produce long-term fitness benefits in small populations without swamping locally adaptive variation.",

    "abstract": "Influenza, a communicable disease, affects thousands of people worldwide. Young children, elderly, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women are at higher risk for being infected by the influenza virus. Our study aims to highlight differentially expressed genes in influenza disease compared to influenza vaccination. We also investigate genetic variation due to the age and sex of samples. To accomplish our goals, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data. Our inclusion criteria included subjects with influenza, subjects who received the influenza vaccine and healthy controls. We curated 18 microarray datasets for a total of 3,481 samples (1,277 controls, 297 influenza infection, 1,907 influenza vaccination). We pre-processed the raw microarray expression data in R using packages available to pre-process Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms. We used a Box-Cox power transformation of the data prior to our down-stream analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. Statistical analyses were based on linear mixed effects model with all study factors and successive likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to identify differentially-expressed genes. We filtered LRT results by disease (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05) and used a two-tailed 10% quantile cutoff to identify biologically significant genes. Furthermore, we assessed age and sex effects on the disease genes by filtering for genes with a statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05) interaction between disease and age, and disease and sex. We identified 4,889 statistically significant genes when we filtered the LRT results by disease factor, and gene enrichment analysis (gene ontology and pathways) included innate immune response, viral process, defense response to virus, Hematopoietic cell lineage and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our quantile filtered gene lists comprised of 978 genes each associated with influenza infection and vaccination. We also identified 907 and 48 genes with statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05) disease-age and disease-sex interactions respectively. Our meta-analysis approach highlights key gene signatures and their associated pathways for both influenza infection and vaccination. We also were able to identify genes with an age and sex effect. This gives potential for improving current vaccines and exploring genes that are expressed equally across ages when considering universal vaccinations for influenza.",

    "abstract": "Cocoa bean fermentation is an important microbial driven process where metabolites that affect chocolate quality and aroma are produced. Although considerable research has been devoted to the yeast and bacteria species involved in this process, less attention has been paid to the role of populations and strains, which hinders its selection, monitoring and use. Here we present a study that evaluates the microbial diversity associated to the tools and bean mass during spontaneous cocoa fermentation and in two distinct agro-ecological zones in Colombia. Using high-throughput sequencing of molecular markers for bacteria and yeast, we established the dynamics at the species-level (OTUs) and strains-level (oligotypes). Our results show that cocoa bean fermentation is catalyzed by a composite of strains within each OTU and not by one single strain. Eventhough we found only a few bacterial OTUs, one Enterobacter, three of Lactic Acid Bacteria and two of Acetic Acid Bacteria, these could be further split into 6, 23 and 19 oligotypes, respectively. Only two fungal OTUs were found. Comparison between fermentations suggest that local protocols generated a specific footprint in the dynamics of the microbial communities and that tools are reservoirs of some of those groups. The population analysis shows that the oligotypes that become most dominant are the same in the two locations, coupling co-abundance and dominance analysis we suggest that a combination of Enterobacter and Acetobacter oligotypes seem more optimal for the starter cultures. In conclusion, the results presented here show that exploring the fine level dynamics of microbial fermentation is necessary to understand the patterns of the dominance of specific populations and can be used as a valuable approach to select and monitor specific bacteria for the design of starter cultures in the food industry.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIn Colombia, the lack of tools to validate and standardize fermentation protocols are one of the principal reasons why Colombian cocoa beans are not recognized as \\\"fine-flavor\\\" and widely marketed. Because of the large influence of the microbial fermentation in cocoa quality, the present study explores the microbial dynamics using high-throughput sequencing of molecular markers in two of the most important producer regions in Colombia. The results show that the identification of dominant and transitive strains can be used to select, design and monitor starter cultures and/or the effect of adjustments in the fermentation protocols.",

    "abstract": "Human anterior and posterior hippocampus (aHC, pHC) differ in connectivity and behavioral correlates. Here we report physiological differences. During NREM sleep, the human hippocampus generates sharpwave-ripples (SWR) similar to those which in rodents mark memory replay. We show that while pHC generates SWR, it also generates about as many spindle-ripples (SSR: ripples phase-locked to local spindles). In contrast, SSR are rare in aHC. Like SWR, SSR often co-occur with neocortical theta bursts (TB), downstates (DS), spindles (SS) and upstates (US), which coordinate cortico-hippocampal interactions and facilitate consolidation in rodents. SWR co-occur with these waves in widespread cortical areas, especially fronto-central. These waves typically occur in the sequence TB-DS-SS-US, with SWR usually occurring prior to SS-US. In contrast, SSR occur [~]350 ms later, with a strong preference for co-occurrence with posterior-parietal SS. pHC-SS were strongly phase-locked with parietal-SS, and pHC-SSR were phase-coupled with pHC-SS and parietal-SS. Human SWR (and associated replay events, if any) are separated by [~]5 s on average, whereas ripples on successive SSR peaks are separated by only [~]80 ms. These distinctive physiological properties of pHC-SSR enable an alternative mechanism for hippocampal engagement with neocortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRodent hippocampal neurons replay waking events during sharpwave-ripples in NREM sleep, facilitating memory transfer to a permanent cortical store. We show that human anterior hippocampus also produces sharpwave-ripples, but spindle-ripples predominate in posterior. Whereas sharpwave-ripples typically occur as cortex emerges from inactivity, spindle-ripples typically occur at peak cortical activity. Furthermore, posterior hippocampal spindle-ripples are tightly coupled to posterior parietal locations activated by conscious recollection. Finally, multiple spindle-ripples can recur within a second, whereas sharpwave-ripples are separated by about 5s. The human posterior hippocampus is considered homologous to rodent dorsal hippocampus, which is thought to be specialized for consolidation of specific memory details. We speculate that these distinct physiological characteristics of posterior hippocampal spindle-ripples may support a related function in humans.",

In humans, HC-SWR have only been recorded with electrodes implanted to localize epileptogenesis.

We demonstrated typical SWR in those rare HC recordings which lack interictal epileptiform spikes (IIS), and with no or minimal seizure involvement. These HC-SWR have a similar rate (~12/min) and apparent intra-HC topography (ripple maximum in putative stratum pyramidale, slow wave in radiatum) as rodents, though with lower frequency (~85Hz compared to ~140Hz in rodents). Similar SWR are found in HC with IIS, but no significant seizure involvement. These SWR were modulated by behavior, being largely absent (<2/min) except during NREM sleep in both stage 2 (~9/min) and stage 3 (~15/min), distinguishing them from IIS. This study quantifies the basic characteristics of a strictly selected sample of SWR recorded in relatively healthy human hippocampi.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is almost ubiquitous across the tree of life, but clear demonstrations that it is adaptive are rare. In dioecious plants, males and females frequently show  leaky sex expression, with individuals occasionally producing flowers of the opposite sex. Here, we demonstrate that leaky sex expression in the wind-pollinated dioecious herb Mercurialis annua is plastically responsive to its mating context. We compared experimental populations of females growing either with or without males. Females growing in the absence of males were leakier in their sex expression than controls with males, producing more than twice as many male flowers. Moreover, because greater leakiness was more highly represented in the populations progeny, we conclude that enhanced leakiness in sex expression is adaptive in M. annua. We discuss differences in the degree of plasticity between ploidal races of Mercurialis annua in terms of likely differences in the reliability of the signal plants may perceive for the presence of males in their populations. Our results provide a striking instance of adaptive plasticity in the reproductive behavior of plants and draw attention to possible constraints on plasticity when the environmental signals that individuals receive are unreliable.",

Although the biasing effects of such correlations are well understood, it would be useful to be able to estimate these parameters in the twin model. Here we consider the possibility of relaxing this assumption by adding polygenic score to the (univariate) twin model. We demonstrated numerically and analytically this extension renders the additive genetic (A) - unshared environmental correlation (E) and the additive genetic (A) - shared environmental (C) correlations simultaneously identified. We studied the statistical power to detect A-C and A-E correlations in the ACE model, and to detect A-E correlation in the AE model. The results showed that the power to detect these covariance terms, given 1000 MZ and 1000 DZ twin pairs (=0.05), depends greatly on the parameter settings of the model. We show fixing the estimated percentage of variance in the outcome trait that is due to the polygenic scores greatly increases statistical power.",

Currently, there is no rapid, cost-effective, and accurate molecular method for detecting this potentially life-threatening pathogen, particularly in polymicrobial specimens, suggesting that its true prevalence may be underestimated. Here, we used large-scale comparative genomics to identify a specific genetic target for S. maltophilia, with subsequent development and validation of a real-time PCR assay for its detection. Analysis of 165 Stenotrophomonas spp. genomes identified a 4kb region specific to S. maltophilia, which was targeted for Black Hole Quencher assay design. Our assay yielded the positive detection of 89 of 89 (100%) clinical S. maltophilia strains, and no amplification of 23 non-S. maltophilia clinical isolates. S. maltophilia was detected in 10/16 CF sputa, demonstrating the utility for direct detection in respiratory specimens. The assay demonstrated good sensitivity, with limits of detection and quantitation on pure culture of ~10 and ~100 genome equivalents, respectively. Our assay provides a highly specific, sensitive, and cost-effective method for the accurate identification of S. maltophilia, and will improve the diagnosis and treatment of this under-recognized pathogen by enabling its accurate and rapid detection from polymicrobial clinical and environmental samples.",

    "abstract": "During immature stages, adult-born neurons pass through critical periods for survival and plasticity. It is generally assumed that by 2 months of age adult-born neurons are mature and equivalent to the broader neuronal population, raising questions of how they might contribute to hippocampal function in old age when neurogenesis has declined. However, few have examined adult-born neurons beyond the critical period, or directly compared them to neurons born in infancy. Here, we used a retrovirus to visualize functionally-relevant morphological features of 2- to 24-week-old adult-born neurons in male rats. From 2-7 weeks neurons grew and attained a relatively mature phenotype. However, several features of 7-week-old neurons suggested a later wave of growth: these neurons had larger nuclei, thicker dendrites and more dendritic filopodia than all other groups. Indeed, between 7-24 weeks, adult-born neurons gained additional dendritic branches, grew a 2nd primary dendrite, acquired more mushroom spines and had enlarged mossy fiber presynaptic terminals. Compared to neonatally-born neurons, old adult-born neurons had greater spine density, larger presynaptic terminals, and more putative efferent filopodial contacts onto inhibitory neurons. By integrating rates of cell birth and growth across the lifespan, we estimate that adult neurogenesis ultimately produces half of the cells and the majority of spines in the dentate gyrus. Critically, protracted development contributes to the plasticity of the hippocampus through to the end of life, even after cell production declines. Persistent differences from neonatally-born neurons may additionally endow adult-born neurons with unique functions even after they have matured.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus throughout adult life and contributes to memory and emotion. It is generally assumed that new neurons have the greatest impact on behavior when they are immature and plastic. However, since neurogenesis declines dramatically with age, it is unclear how they might contribute to behavior later in life when cell proliferation has slowed. Here we find that newborn neurons mature over many months in rats, and end up with distinct morphological features compared to neurons born in infancy. Using a mathematical model, we estimate that a large fraction of neurons is added in adulthood. Moreover, their extended growth produces a reserve of plasticity that persists even after neurogenesis has declined to low rates.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy affecting brain activity. It is unclear to what extent JME leads to abnormal network dynamics across functional networks. Here, we proposed a method to characterise network dynamics in MEG resting-state data, combining a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM) and the associated energy landscape analysis. Fifty-two JME patients and healthy controls underwent a resting-state MEG recording session. We fitted the pMEM to the oscillatory power envelopes in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz) and gamma (30-60 Hz) bands in three source-localised resting-state networks: the frontoparietal network (FPN), the default mode network (DMN), and the sensorimotor network (SMN). The pMEM provided an accurate fit to the MEG oscillatory activity in both patient and control groups, and allowed estimation of the occurrence probability of each network state, with its regional activity and pairwise regional co-activation constrained by empirical data. We used energy values derived from the pMEM to depict an energy landscape of each network, with a higher energy state corresponding to a lower occurrence probability. When comparing the energy landscapes between groups, JME patients showed fewer local energy minima than controls and had elevated energy values for the FPN within the theta, beta and gamma-bands. Furthermore, numerical simulation of the fitted pMEM showed that the proportion of time the FPN was occupied within the basins of characteristic energy minima was shortened in JME patients. These network alterations were confirmed by a significant leave-one-out classification of individual participants based on a support vector machine employing the energy values of pMEM as features. Our findings suggested that JME patients had altered multi-stability in selective functional networks and frequency bands in the frontoparietal cortices.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAn energy landscape analysis characterises the dynamics of MEG oscillatory activity\\nC_LIO_LIPatients with JME exhibit fewer local minima of the energy in their energy landscapes\\nC_LIO_LIJME affects the network dynamics in the frontoparietal network.\\nC_LIO_LIEnergy landscape measures allow good single-patient classification.\\nC_LI",

However, in many ways the retrosplenial cortex remains understudied. Here, we sought to characterize spatial correlates of neurons within the region during free exploration in two-dimensional environments. We report that a large percentage of retrosplenial cortex neurons have spatial receptive fields that are active when environmental boundaries are positioned at a specific orientation and distance relative to the animal itself. We demonstrate that this vector-based location signal is encoded in egocentric coordinates, localized to the dysgranular retrosplenial sub-region, independent of self-motion, and context invariant. Further, we identify a sub-population of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation. Accordingly, the current work identifies a robust egocentric spatial code in retrosplenial cortex that can facilitate spatial coordinate system transformations and support the anchoring, generation, and utilization of allocentric representations.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with complex etiologies and genetic architecture. Animal models have a critical role in understanding the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Here we studied epilepsy utilizing a genetic reference population of Collaborative Cross (CC) mice with publicly available whole genome sequences. We measured multiple epilepsy traits in 35 CC strains, and we identified novel animal models that exhibit extreme outcomes in seizure susceptibility, seizure propagation, epileptogenesis, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We performed QTL mapping in an F2 population and identified seven novel and one previously identified loci associated with seizure sensitivity. We combined whole genome sequence and hippocampal gene expression to pinpoint biologically plausible candidate genes and candidate variants associated with seizure sensitivity. These resources provide a powerful toolbox for studying complex features of seizures and for identifying genes associated with particular seizure outcomes, and hence will facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets for epilepsy.",
