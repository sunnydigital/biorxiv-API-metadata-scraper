    "abstract": "Land plant shoot structures evolved a diversity of lateral organs as morphological adaptations to the terrestrial environment, in which lateral organs independently evolved in each lineage in the sporophyte or gametophyte generation. The gametophyte meristem of the basally-diverging plant Marchantia polymorpha produces axes with non-photosynthetic scale-like lateral organs instead of leaves. Here we report that an ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1) family protein in Marchantia, MpTAWAWA1 (MpTAW1), regulates meristem maintenance and lateral organ development. A mutation in MpTAW1, preferentially expressed in lateral organs, induces lateral organs with mis-specified identity and increased cell number, and furthermore, causes defects in apical meristem maintenance. Remarkably, MpTAW1 expression rescued the elongated-spikelet phenotype of a rice mutant of MpTAW1 homologue. This suggests that ALOG genes are co-opted to specify lateral organ identities in both gametophyte and sporophyte shoots by repressing lateral organ growth. We propose that the recruitment of ALOG-mediated lateral organ modification was in part responsible for the convergent evolution of independently-evolved lateral organs among highly divergent plant lineages and contributed to the morphological diversification of land plants.",

    "abstract": "MotivationModern flow cytometry technology has enabled the simultaneous analysis of multiple cell markers at the single-cell level, and it is widely used in a broad field of research. The detection of cell populations in flow cytometry data has long been dependent on \\\"manual gating\\\" by visual inspection. Recently, numerous software have been developed for automatic, computationally guided detection of cell populations; however, they are not designed for time-series flow cytometry data. Time-series flow cytometry data are indispensable for investigating the dynamics of cell populations that could not be elucidated by static time-point analysis.\\n\\nTherefore, there is a great need for tools to systematically analyze time-series flow cytometry data.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a simple and efficient statistical framework, named CYBERTRACK (CYtometry-Based Estimation and Reasoning for TRACKing cell populations), to perform clustering and cell population tracking for time-series flow cytometry data. CYBERTRACK assumes that flow cytometry data are generated from a multivariate Gaussian mixture distribution with its mixture proportion at the current time dependent on that at a previous timepoint. Using simulation data, we evaluate the performance of CYBERTRACK when estimating parameters for a multivariate Gaussian mixture distribution, tracking time-dependent transitions of mixture proportions, and detecting change-points in the overall mixture proportion. The CYBERTRACK performance is validated using two real flow cytometry datasets, which demonstrate that the population dynamics detected by CYBERTRACK are consistent with our prior knowledge of lymphocyte behavior.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results indicate that CYBERTRACK offers better understandings of time-dependent cell population dynamics to cytometry users by systematically analyzing time-series flow cytometry data.",

    "abstract": "The need to understand cell developmental processes spawned a plethora of computational methods for discovering hierarchies from scRNAseq data. However, existing techniques are based on Euclidean geometry, a suboptimal choice for modeling complex cell trajectories with multiple branches. To overcome this fundamental representation issue we propose Poincare maps, a method that harness the power of hyperbolic geometry into the realm of single-cell data analysis. Often understood as a continuous extension of trees, hyperbolic geometry enables the embedding of complex hierarchical data in only two dimensions while preserving the pairwise distances between points in the hierarchy. This enables direct exploratory analysis and the use of our embeddings in a wide variety of downstream data analysis tasks, such as visualization, clustering, lineage detection and pseudo-time inference. When compared to existing methods --unable to address all these important tasks using a single embedding-- Poincare maps produce state-of-the-art two-dimensional representations of cell trajectories on multiple scRNAseq datasets. More specifically, we demonstrate that Poincare maps allow in a straightforward manner to formulate new hypotheses about biological processes unbeknown to prior methods.\n\nSignificance statementThe discovery of hierarchies in biological processes is central to developmental biology. We propose Poincare maps, a new method based on hyperbolic geometry to discover continuous hierarchies from pairwise similarities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple single-cell datasets on tasks such as visualization, clustering, lineage identification, and pseudo-time inference.",

    "abstract": "In the era of opioid abuse epidemics, there is an increased demand for understanding how opioid receptors can be allosterically modulated to guide the development of more effective and safer opioid therapies. Among the modulators of the {micro}-opioid (MOP) receptor, which is the pharmacological target for the majority of clinically used opioid drugs, are monovalent and divalent cations. Specifically, the monovalent sodium cation (Na+) has been known for decades to affect MOP receptor signaling by reducing agonist binding, whereas the divalent magnesium cation (Mg2+) has been shown to have the opposite effect, notwithstanding the presence of sodium chloride. While ultra-high resolution opioid receptor crystal structures have revealed a specific Na+ binding site and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have supported the idea that this monovalent ion reduces agonist binding by stabilizing the receptor inactive state, the putative binding site of Mg2+ on the MOP receptor, as well as the molecular determinants responsible for its positive allosteric modulation of the receptor, are unknown. In this work, we carried out tens of microseconds of all-atom MD simulations to investigate the simultaneous binding of Mg2+ and Na+ cations to inactive and active crystal structures of the MOP receptor embedded in an explicit lipid/water environment. Analyses of these simulations shed light on (a) the preferred binding sites of Mg2+ on the MOP receptor, (b) details of the competition between Mg2+ and Na+ cations for specific sites, (c) estimates of binding affinities, and (d) testable hypotheses of the molecular mechanism underlying the positive allosteric modulation of the MOP receptor by the Mg2+ cation.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceOverprescription of opioid drugs in the late 1990s, followed by abuse of both prescription and illicit opioid drugs, has led to what is nowadays called \\\"opioid overdose crisis\\\" or \\\"opioid epidemic\\\", with more than 130 Americans dying daily from opioid overdose at the time of writing. To reduce opioid doses, and thereby prevent or treat overdose and opioid use disorders, attention has recently shifted to the use of co-analgesics. Understanding how opioid receptor targets can be allosterically modulated by these elements, including cations, is key to the development of improved therapeutics. Here, we provide an atomic-level understanding of the mechanism by which magnesium binds to the {micro}-opioid receptor and enhances opioid drug efficacy by stabilizing the receptor activated state.",

    "abstract": "Evolving in groups can either enhance or reduce an individuals task performance. Still, we know little about the factors underlying group performance, which may be reduced to three major dimensions: (a) the individuals ability to perform a task, (b) the dependency on environmental conditions, and (c) the perception of, and the reaction to, other group members. In our research, we investigated how these dimensions interrelate in simulated evolution experiments using adaptive agents equipped with Markov brains (\\\"animats\\\"). We evolved the animats to perform a spatial-navigation task under various evolutionary setups. The last generation of each evolution simulation was tested across modified conditions to evaluate and compare the animats reliability when faced with change. Moreover, the complexity of the evolved Markov brains was assessed based on measures of information integration. We found that, under the right conditions, specialized animats were as reliable as animats already evolved for the modified tasks, that interaction between animats was dependent on the environment and on the design of the animats, and that the task difficulty influenced the correlation between the performance of the animat and its brain complexity. Generally, our results suggest that the interrelation between the aforementioned dimensions is complex and their contribution to the groups task performance, reliability, and brain complexity varies, which points to further dependencies. Still, our study reveals that balancing the group size and individual cognitive abilities prevents over-specialization and can help to evolve better reliability under unknown environmental situations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to adapt to environmental changes is an essential attribute of organisms which have had evolutionary success. We designed a simulated evolution experiment to better understand the relevant features of such organisms and the conditions under which they evolve: First, we created diverse groups of cognitive systems by evolving simulated organisms (\\\"animats\\\") acting in groups on a spatial-navigation task. Second, we post-evolutionary tested the final evolved animats in new environments-not encountered before- in order to test their reliability when faced with change. Our results imply that the ability to generalize to environments with changing task demands can have complex dependencies on the cognitive design and sensor configuration of the organism itself, as well as its social or environmental conditions.",

The side population (SP) phenotype enriches for stem cells throughout the body, and SP cells have been identified in the heart. We generated a novel Abcg2-driven, genetic lineage-tracing mouse model and show efficient labeling of SP cells. Labeled SP cells give rise to terminally differentiated cells in bone marrow and intestines. In the heart, we find that Abcg2-expressing SP cells contribute to cardiomyocyte labeling, which is further enhanced in response to different forms of cardiac injury. We find that cardiac SP cells fuse with preexisting cardiomyocytes, which stimulates cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and likely proliferation, instead of directly differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Our findings provide evidence that cardiac SP cells contribute to endogenous cardiac regeneration through cardiomyocyte fusion.",

This clinically necessary monitoring period provides an increasingly utilized research opportunity to study human neurophysiology, however, ethical concerns demand a thorough appreciation of the associated risks.\\n\\nObjectiveWe measured the incidence of research stimulation-associated seizures in a large multi-institutional study on brain stimulations effect on memory in order to determine if brain stimulation was statistically associated with seizure incidence, and identify potential risk factors for stimulation-associated seizures.\\n\\nMethods188 subjects undergoing iEEG monitoring across 10 institutions participated in 770 research stimulation sessions over 3.5 years. Seizures within 30 minutes of a stimulation session were included in our retrospective analysis. We analyzed stimulation parameters, seizure incidence, and typical seizure patterns, to assess the likelihood that recorded seizures were stimulation-induced, rather than events that occurred by chance in epilepsy patients prone to seizing.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 14 seizures were included in our analysis. All events were single seizures, and no adverse events occurred. The mean amplitude of seizure-associated stimulation did not differ significantly from the mean amplitude delivered in sessions without seizures.\\n\\nIn order to determine the likelihood that seizures were stimulation induced, we used three sets of analyses: Visual iEEG analysis, statistical frequency, and power analyses. We determined that three of the 14 seizures were likely stimulation-induced, five were possibly stimulation-induced, and six were unlikely stimulation-induced. Overall, we estimate a rate of stimulation-induced seizures between 0.39% and 1.82% of sessions.\\n\\nConclusionsThe rarity of stimulation-associated seizures, and that none added morbidity or affected the clinical course of any patient, are important findings for understanding the feasibility and safety of intracranial stimulation for research purposes.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, lack of speech, ataxia, EEG abnormalities, and epilepsy. Seizures in AS individuals are often refractory to existing antiepileptic medications. Therefore, there is an unmet need for better seizure control, which could potentially improve other symptomatic domains such as cognitive function. Cannabidiol (CBD), a major phytocannabinoid constituent of cannabis, has anti-seizure activity and behavioral benefits in preclinical and clinical studies for some disorders associated with epilepsy, suggesting that the same could be true for AS. Here we show that acute CBD (100 mg/kg) attenuated hyperthermia- and acoustically-induced seizures in a mouse model of AS. However, neither acute CBD nor a two-weeklong course of CBD administered immediately after a kindling protocol could halt the pro-epileptogenic plasticity observed in AS model mice. CBD had a mild sedative effect, but did not have a major impact on motor performance. CBD abrogated the enhanced delta rhythms observed in AS model mice, indicating that CBD administration could also help normalize the EEG deficits observed in individuals with AS. Our results provide critical preclinical evidence supporting CBD treatment of seizures and alleviation of EEG abnormalities in AS, and will thus help guide the rational development of CBD as an AS adjunctive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in regulating transcriptional networks and timing of gene expression. Chromatin remodelers such as SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) harbor many protein components, with the catalytic subunit providing ATPase activity to displace histones along or from the DNA molecules, and associated subunits ensuring tissue specificity and transcriptional or co-transcriptional activities. Mutations in several of the SWI/SNF subunits have been linked to cancer. Here, we describe how SMARCD3/Baf60c expression is associated with hormone positive (ER+) breast cancer. The level SMARCD3, as detected by immunohistochemistry in breast cancer patient samples, is correlated with differential long-term disease-free survival. In contrast, the expression level of SMARCD1/Baf60a and SMARCD2/Baf60b, which are mutually exclusive within the SWI/SNF complex and have a partially redundant function, lacks predictive value in breast cancer patient samples. Lower proliferation rates are observed in SMARCD3 depleted cells, which reflects a failure to fully progress through G2/M, and an increase in endoreplication. In the absence of SMARCD3, p21 accumulates in cells but does not halt the cell cycle, and DNA damage accumulates and remains unrepaired. Taken together, our data begin to explain why ER+ breast cancer patients with low SMARCD3 expressing tumors exhibit reduced survival rates compared to patients expressing normal or higher levels of SMARCD3. SMARCD3 might act as a tumor suppressor role through regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and could be a reliable and specific breast cancer prognostic biomarker.\\n\\nSignificanceMutations in chromatin remodelers are a leading cause of cancer. Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers represent approximately 80% of all cases diagnosed. Although these tumors can be treated with hormone therapy, most breast cancer fatalities occur in ER+ breast cancer patients, due to metastasis. Low expression of SMARCD3 in ER+ cancer is associated with diminished survival rates. As such, SMARCD3 could be used as a predictive biomarker for survival. In addition, we have identified a role for SMARCD3 in the cell cycle, which could at least partially explain its protective role in breast cancer. While catalytic subunits are often viewed as the major components in chromatin remodeling function, we show here new evidence that mutations or silencing of SMARCD3 may also contribute to genomic instability and thus development of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The ecological and developmental selective pressures associated with evolution have shaped most animal traits, such as behavior, morphology and neurobiology. As such, the examination of phylogenetic characteristics of the nervous system can be utilized as a means to assess these traits, and thus, to evaluate the underlying selective pressures that produce evolutionary variation between species. Recent studies across a multitude of Drosophila have hypothesized the existence of a fundamental tradeoff between two primary sensory organs, the eye and the antenna. However, the identification of any potential ecological mechanisms for this observed tradeoff have not been firmly established. Our current study examines two monophyletic species within the obscura group, and asserts that despite their close relatedness and overlapping ecology, they deviate strongly in both visual and olfactory investment. Here we contend that both courtship and microhabitat preferences mirror and support the observed inverse variation in these sensory traits. Moreover, that this variation in visual and olfactory investment between closely-related species seems to provide relaxed competition, a process by which similar species can use a shared environment differently and in ways that help them both coexist. The nervous system has a unique role in evolution as it provides the functional connection between morphology, physiology, and behavior. As such, characterizing any tradeoffs between costs and benefits for the nervous system may be essential to our understanding of animal diversity, as well as vital to our understanding of the selective forces that have shaped the natural world.",

    "abstract": "All land plants depend on proteins called  expansins that non-enzymatically loosen structural cellulose, enabling cell wall extension during normal growth. Surprisingly, expansin genes are also present - but functionally uncharacterized - in taxonomically diverse bacteria and fungi that do not produce cellulosic cell walls. Here, we find that Erwinia tracheiphila (Enterobacteriaceae), the causative agent of bacterial wilt of cucurbits, has horizontally acquired an operon with a microbial expansin (exlx) gene and a glycoside hydrolase family 5 (gh5) gene. E. tracheiphila is an unusually virulent plant pathogen that induces systemic wilt symptoms followed by plant death, and has only recently emerged into cultivated cucurbit populations in temperate Eastern North America. Plant inoculation experiments with deletion mutants show that EXLX-GH5 is a secreted virulence factor that confers efficient xylem movement and colonization ability to E. tracheiphila. Bacterial colonization of xylem blocks sap flow, inducing wilt symptoms and causing plant death. Together, these results suggest that the horizontal acquisition of the exlx-gh5 locus was likely a key step driving the recent emergence of E. tracheiphila. The increase in E. tracheiphila virulence conferred by microbial expansins, the presence of this gene in many other bacterial and fungal wilt-inducing plant pathogen species, and the amenability of microbial expansins to horizontal gene transfer suggest this gene may be an under-appreciated virulence factor in taxonomically diverse agricultural pathogens.\\n\\nImportanceErwinia tracheiphila is a bacterial plant pathogen that causes a fatal wilt infection in cucurbit crop plants. Here, we report that E. tracheiphila has horizontally acquired a microbial expansin gene (exlx) adjacent to a glycoside hydrolase family 5 (gh5) gene. Expansins are predominantly associated with plants due to their essential role in loosening structural cell wall cellulose during normal growth. We find that the EXLX and GH5 proteins in E. tracheiphila function as a single complex to facilitate xylem colonization, possibly by manipulating the size of xylem structures that normally exclude the passage of bacteria. This suggests that horizontal acquisition of the exlx-gh5 locus was likely a key step in the recent emergence of E. tracheiphila as an unusually virulent plant pathogen.

    "abstract": "Mutational tolerance inferred from laboratory-based mutational studies is typically much higher than observed natural sequence variation. Using saturation mutagenesis, we show that the ccdA antitoxin component of the ccdAB toxin-antitoxin system is unusually sensitive to mutation with over 60% of mutations leading to loss of function. Multi-base synonymous mutations at a codon display enhanced propensity to show altered phenotypes, relative to single-base ones. Such mutations modulate RNA structure, leading to altered relative translation efficiencies of the two genes in the operon, and a CcdA:CcdB protein ratio below one. These insights were used to predict and experimentally validate synonymous mutations that lead to loss of function in the unrelated relBE operon as well as the lacZ gene. Thus, synonymous mutations can have significant phenotypic effects, in the absence of overexpression or extraneous reporters. More generally, proteins are likely more sensitive to mutation than inferred from previous saturation mutagenesis studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) literature suggests that tACS effects can in principle be both frequency and phase specific. In a series of three experiments using 69 participants used binocular rivalry percepts as a read-out for the effects of phase-synchronized tACS stimulation. To test for phase specificity, with frequency the same in each eye, we visually stimulated each eye with 3Hz, with stimuli in each eye presented in temporal in antiphase. The frequency-specific paradigm visually stimulated the right eye with 3Hz, and the left eye with 5Hz. Each experiment was accompanied by 3Hz tACS, whose phase with respect to the visual stimulus was varied by 0{degrees}, 90{degrees}, 180{degrees}, or 270{degrees} in relation to the right eyes stimulus. A baseline no-tACS block preceded the stimulation blocks and two more followed, immediately and ten minutes after. Individual blocks lasted 4 minutes. Additionally, a no-tACS control experiment identical to the 3 Hz anti-phase visual stimuli setup was conducted, keeping all parameters the same but eliminating tACS. During stimulation, the 3 Hz anti-phase visual stimuli setup slowed the rate of rivalry in both eyes. Conversely, the 3Hz-right, 5Hz-left setup slowed the right (targeted) eye significantly while leaving the left (unstimulated) eye unchanged. In both experiments, durations returned to baseline after 10 minutes. Our results are consistent with the frequency-specific model of tACS, and with the Leveltian hypothesis that stimulation weakens the stimulated eye, as the right eye got weaker when it was directly targeted, and both eyes got weaker when targeted in antiphase. tACS does not appear to preferentially modulating percept durations in one phase more than in another.",

CDKL5 deficient mice display defective epidermal innervation and conditional deletion of Cdkl5 in DRG sensory neurons significantly impairs nociception, phenocopying CDKL5 deficiency disorder in patients. Mechanistically, Cdkl5 interacts with CaMKII to control outgrowth as well as TRPV1-dependent signalling, which are disrupted in both Cdkl5 mutant murine DRG and human iPS-derived nociceptors.

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity is determined by the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory inputs of individual cells. Whether or not these inputs covary over time or between repeated stimuli remains unclear due to the lack of experimental methods for measuring both inputs at the same time. Current methods for conductance measurement are based on repeatedly stimulating neurons while holding their membrane potential at different levels so to reveal either excitation or inhibition, which can only provide the averaged relationship between the two. Here we develop a new framework for simultaneously measuring both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs of single cells in a single trial under current clamp. This method is based on theoretical analysis of passive circuits and can be practically achieved by injecting a high frequency sinusoidal current and then analysing the data using an optimization algorithm. We use simulations to demonstrate the ability of this approach to reveal the excitatory and inhibitory inputs of point neurons, in which we mimic adapting sensory inputs as well as an asynchronous balanced state.",

    "abstract": "The relative contributions of genetics and environment to temporal and geographic variation in human height remain largely unknown. Ancient DNA has identified changes in genetic ancestry over time, but it is not clear whether those changes in ancestry are associated with changes in height. Here, we directly test whether changes over the past 38,000 years in European height predicted using DNA from 1071 ancient individuals are consistent with changes observed in 1159 skeletal remains from comparable populations. We show that the observed decrease in height between the Early Upper Paleolithic and the Mesolithic is qualitatively predicted by genetics. Similarly, both skeletal and genetic height remained constant between the Mesolithic and Neolithic and increased between the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Sitting height changes much less than standing height-consistent with genetic predictions-although genetics predicts a small Bronze Age increase that is not observed in skeletal remains. Geographic variation in stature is also qualitatively consistent with genetic predictions, particularly with respect to latitude. Finally, we hypothesize that an observed decrease in genetic heel bone mineral density in the Neolithic reflects adaptation to the decreased mobility indicated by decreased femoral bending strength. This study provides a model for interpreting phenotypic changes predicted from ancient DNA and demonstrates how they can be combined with phenotypic measurements to understand the relative contribution of genetic and developmentally plastic responses to environmental change.\\n\\nSignificanceMeasurements of prehistoric human skeletal remains provide a record of changes in height and other anthropometric traits, over time. Often, these changes are interpreted in terms of plastic developmental response to shifts in diet, climate or other environmental factors. These changes can also be genetic in origin but, until recently, it has been impossible to separate the effects of genetics and environment. Here we use ancient DNA to directly estimate genetic changes in phenotypes and to identify changes driven not by genetics, but by environment. We show that changes over the past 35,000 years are largely predicted by genetics, but also identify specific shifts that are more likely to be environmentally driven.",

Phylogenetic classification of rodent Eimeria suggested that some species have a broader host range than previously assumed. We explore if Eimeria spp. infecting house mice are misclassified by the most widely used molecular markers due to a lack of resolution, or if, instead, these parasite species are indeed infecting multiple host species.\\n\\nWith the commonly used markers (18S/COI), we recovered monophyletic clades of E. falciformis and E. vermiformis from Mus that included E. apionodes identified in other rodent host species (Apodemus spp., Myodes glareolus, and Microtus arvalis). A lack of internal resolution in these clades could suggest the existence of a species complex with a wide host range infecting murid and cricetid rodents. We question, however, the power of COI and 18S markers to provide adequate resolution for assessing host specificity. In addition to the rarely used marker ORF470 from the apicoplast genome, we present multilocus genotyping as an alternative approach. Phylogenetic analysis of 35 nuclear markers differentiated E. falciformis from house mice from isolates from Apodemus hosts. Isolates of E. vermiformis from Mus are still found in clusters interleaved with non-Mus isolates, even with this high resolution data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we show that species-level resolution should not be assumed for COI and 18S markers in Coccidia. Host-parasite co-speciation at shallow phylogenetic nodes, as well as contemporary coccidian host ranges more generally, are still open questions that need to be addressed using novel genetic markers with higher resolution.",

    "abstract": "The family Rhizobiaceae includes many genera of soil bacteria, often isolated for their association with plants. Herein, we investigate the genomic diversity of a group of Rhizobium species and unclassified strains isolated from atypical environments, including seawater, rock matrix or polluted soil. Based on whole-genome similarity and core genome phylogeny, we show that this group corresponds to the genus Pseudorhizobium. We thus reclassify Rhizobium halotolerans, R. marinum, R. flavum and R. endolithicum as P. halotolerans comb. nov., P. marinum comb. nov., P. flavum comb. nov. and R. endolithicum comb. nov., respectively, and show that P. pelagicum is a synonym of P. marinum. We also delineate a new chemolithoautotroph species, P. banfieldiae sp. nov., whose type strain is NT-26T (= DSM 106348T = CFBP 8663T). This genome-based classification was supported by a chemotaxonomic comparison, with gradual taxonomic resolution provided by fatty acid, protein and metabolic profiles. In addition, we used a phylogenetic approach to infer scenarios of duplication, horizontal transfer and loss for all genes in the Pseudorhizobium pangenome. We thus identify the key functions associated with the diversification of each species and higher clades, shedding light on the mechanisms of adaptation to their respective ecological niches. Respiratory proteins acquired at the origin of Pseudorhizobium are combined with clade-specific genes to encode different strategies for detoxification and nutrition in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Finally, we predict diagnostic phenotypes for the distinction of P. banfieldiae from other Pseudorhizobium species, including autotrophy and sensitivity to the azo dye Congo Red, which we experimentally validated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein, ataxin-3 (ATXN3). No preventive treatment is yet available for SCA3. Because SCA3 is likely caused by a toxic gain of ATXN3 function, a rational therapeutic strategy is to reduce mutant ATXN3 levels by targeting pathways that control its production or stability. Here, we sought to identify genes that modulate ATXN3 levels as potential therapeutic targets in this fatal disorder.\\n\\nMethodsWe screened a collection of siRNAs targeting 2742 druggable human genes using a cell-based assay based on luminescence readout of polyQ-expanded ATXN3. From 317 candidate genes identified in the primary screen, 100 genes were selected for validation. Among the 33 genes confirmed in secondary assays, 15 were validated in an independent cell model as modulators of pathogenic ATXN3 protein levels. Ten of these genes were then assessed in a Drosophila model of SCA3, and one was confirmed as a key modulator of physiological ATXN3 abundance in SCA3 neuronal progenitor cells.\\n\\nResultsAmong the 15 genes shown to modulate ATXN3 in mammalian cells, orthologs of CHD4, FBXL3, HR and MC3R regulate mutant ATXN3-mediated toxicity in fly eyes. Further mechanistic studies of one of these genes, FBXL3, encoding a F-box protein that is a component of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, showed that it reduces levels of normal and pathogenic ATXN3 in SCA3 neuronal progenitor cells, primarily via a SCF complex-dependent manner. Bioinformatic analysis of the 15 genes revealed a potential molecular network with connections to tumor necrosis factor-/nuclear factor-kappa B (TNF/NF-kB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified 15 druggable genes with diverse functions to be suppressors or enhancers of pathogenic ATXN3 abundance. Among identified pathways highlighted by this screen, the FBXL3/SCF axis represents a novel molecular pathway that regulates physiological levels of ATXN3 protein.",

    "abstract": "Understanding circuit organization depends on identification of cell types. Recent advances in transcriptional profiling methods have enabled classification of cell types by their gene expression. While exceptionally powerful and high throughput, the ground-truth validation of these methods is difficult: if cell type is unknown, how does one assess whether a given analysis accurately captures neuronal identity? To shed light on the capabilities and limitations of solely using transcriptional profiling for cell type classification, we performed two forms of transcriptional profiling - RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR, in single, unambiguously identified neurons from two small crustacean networks: the stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia. We then combined our knowledge of cell type with unbiased clustering analyses and supervised machine learning to determine how accurately functionally-defined neuron types can be classified by expression profile alone. Our results demonstrate that expression profile is able to capture neuronal identity most accurately when combined with multimodal information that allows for post-hoc grouping so analysis can proceed from a supervised perspective. Solely unsupervised clustering can lead to misidentification and an inability to distinguish between two or more cell types. Therefore, our study supports the general utility of cell identification by transcriptional profiling, but adds a caution: it is difficult or impossible to know under what conditions transcriptional profiling alone is capable of assigning cell identity. Only by combining multiple modalities of information such as physiology, morphology or innervation target can neuronal identity be unambiguously determined.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSingle cell transcriptional profiling has become a widespread tool in cell identification, particularly in the nervous system, based on the notion that genomic information determines cell identity. However, many cell type classification studies are unconstrained by other cellular attributes (e.g., morphology, physiology). Here, we systematically test how accurately transcriptional profiling can assign cell identity to well-studied anatomically- and functionally-identified neurons in two small neuronal networks. While these neurons clearly possess distinct patterns of gene expression across cell types, their expression profiles are not sufficient to unambiguously confirm their identity. We suggest that true cell identity can only be determined by combining gene expression data with other cellular attributes such as innervation pattern, morphology, or physiology.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a dynamic disease, in which lung mechanical and inflammatory processes often interact in a complex, unpredictable manner. We hypothesize that this may be explained by respiratory disease-related systems instability and loss of adaptability to changing environmental conditions, resulting in highly fluctuating biomarkers and symptoms. Using time series of inflammatory (eosinophils, neutrophils, FeNO), clinical and lung function biomarkers (PEF, FVC, and FEV1), we estimated this loss of adaptive capacity (AC) during an experimental perturbation with a rhinovirus in 24 healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Loss of AC was estimated by comparing similarities between pre- and post-challenge time series. Unlike healthy participants, the asthmatics post-viral-challenge state resembled significantly more other rhinovirus-infected asthmatics than their own pre-viral-challenge state (hypergeometric-test: p=0.029). This reveals loss of AC, and supports the novel concept that not only single physiological mechanisms, but interacting dynamic disease properties are altered in asthma and contribute to a more vulnerable phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Defects in transcriptional regulators of pancreatic exocrine differentiation have been implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The locus encoding the transcription factor HNF1A harbors susceptibility variants for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), while KDM6A, encoding the histone demethylase UTX, carries somatic mutations in PDAC. Here, we show that pancreas-specific Hnf1a null mutations phenocopy Utx deficient mutations, and both synergize with KrasG12D to cause PDAC with sarcomatoid features. We combine genetic, epigenomic and biochemical studies to show that HNF1A recruits UTX to genomic binding sites in pancreatic acinar cells. This remodels the acinar enhancer landscape, activates a differentiation program, and indirectly suppresses oncogenic and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. Finally, we identify a subset of non-classical PDAC samples that exhibit the HNF1A/UTX-deficient molecular phenotype. These findings provide direct genetic evidence that HNF1A-deficiency promotes PDAC. They also connect the tumor suppressive role of UTX deficiency with a cell-specific molecular mechanism that underlies PDAC subtype definition.",

    "abstract": "To explore the potential role of tetrathionate in the sulfur cycle of marine sediments, the population ecology of tetrathionate-forming, oxidizing, and respiring microorganisms was revealed at 15-30 cm resolution along two, [~]3-m-long, cores collected from 530- and 580-mbsl water-depths of Arabian Sea, off Indias west coast, within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Metagenome analysis along the two sediment-cores revealed widespread occurrence of the structural genes that govern these metabolisms; high diversity and relative-abundance was also detected for the bacteria known to render these processes. Slurry-incubation of the sediment-samples, pure-culture isolation, and metatranscriptome analysis, corroborated the in situ functionality of all the three metabolic-types. Geochemical analyses revealed thiosulfate (0-11.1 M), pyrite (0.05-1.09 wt %), iron (9232-17234 ppm) and manganese (71-172 ppm) along the two sediment-cores. Pyrites (via abiotic reaction with MnO2) and thiosulfate (via oxidation by chemolithotrophic bacteria prevalent in situ) are apparently the main sources of tetrathionate in this ecosystem. Tetrathionate, in turn, can be either converted to sulfate (via oxidation by the chemolithotrophs present) or reduced back to thiosulfate (via respiration by native bacteria); 0-2.01 mM sulfide present in the sediment-cores may also reduce tetrathionate abiotically to thiosulfate and elemental sulfur. Notably tetrathionate was not detected in situ - high microbiological and geochemical reactivity of this polythionate is apparently instrumental in the cryptic nature of its potential role as a central sulfur cycle intermediate. Biogeochemical roles of this polythionate, albeit revealed here in the context of OMZ sediments, may well extend to the sulfur cycles of other geomicrobiologically-distinct marine sediment horizons.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe brain constantly processes information encoded in temporal sequences of spiking activity. This sequential activity emerges from sensory inputs as well as from the brains own recurrent connectivity and spans multiple dynamically changing timescales. Decoding the temporal order of spiking activity across these varying timescales is a critical function of the brain, but we do not yet understand its neural implementation. The problem is, that the passive dynamics of neural membrane potentials occur on a short millisecond timescale, whereas many cognitive tasks require the integration of information across much slower behavioral timescales. However, actively generated dendritic plateau potentials do occur on such longer timescales, and their essential role for many aspects of cognition has been firmly established by recent experiments. Here, we build on these discoveries and propose a new model of neural computation that emerges from the interaction of localized plateau potentials across a functionally compartmentalized dendritic tree. We show how this interaction offers a robust solution to the timing invariant detection and processing of sequential spike patterns in single neurons. Stochastic synaptic transmission complements the deterministic all-or-none plateau process and improves information transmission by allowing ensembles of neurons to produce graded responses to continuous combinations of features. We found that networks of such neurons can solve highly complex sequence detection tasks by breaking down long inputs into sequences of shorter, random features that can be classified reliably. These results suggest that active dendritic processes are fundamental to neural computation.",

However, the time courses of these neurodevelopmental changes are unknown. Here, we investigated whether structural brain changes were present at 8 to 12 years of age in a group of children with a history of monocular enucleation prior to 3 years of age (the ME group) relative to control participants with normal binocular vision (the BC group). Structural connectivity was measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Relative to the BC group, the ME group exhibited significantly increased radial and mean diffusivity in the optic radiation contralateral to the enucleated eye, the bidirectional interhemispheric V1 to V1 tracts and the V1 to MT tract ipsilateral to the enucleated eye. These changes indicate abnormal myelinization and reduced axonal density in subcortical and cortical visual pathway white matter structures following unilateral enucleation and loss of binocular vision. Our findings are broadly consistent with those recently reported for older uniocular individuals suggesting that these effects are present in childhood and persist into adulthood.",

    "abstract": "In situations requiring immediate action, humans can generate visually-guided responses at remarkably short latencies. Here, to better understand the visual attributes that best evoke such rapid responses, we recorded upper limb muscle activity while participants performed visually-guided reaches towards Gabor patches composed of differing spatial frequencies. We studied reaches initiated from a stable posture (experiment 1, a static condition), or during on-line reach corrections to an abruptly displaced target (experiment 2, a dynamic condition). In both experiments, we detail the latency and prevalence of stimulus-locked responses (SLRs), which are brief bursts of EMG activity that are time-locked to target presentation rather than movement onset. SLRs represent the first wave of EMG recruitment influenced by target presentation, and enable quantification of rapid visuomotor transformations. In both experiments, reach targets composed of low spatial frequencies elicited the shortest latency and most prevalent SLRs, with SLR latency increasing and SLR prevalence decreasing for reach targets composed of progressively higher spatial frequencies. SLRs could be evoked in either the static or dynamic condition, and when present in experiment 2, were associated with shorter latency and larger magnitude corrections. Furthermore, SLRs evolved at shorter latencies (~20 ms) when the arm was already in motion. These results demonstrate that stimuli composed of low spatial frequencies preferentially evoke the most rapid visuomotor responses which, in the context of rapidly correcting an on-going reaching movement, are associated with earlier and larger on-line reach corrections.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHumans have a remarkable capacity to respond quickly to changes in our visual environment. Although our visual world is composed of a range of spatial frequencies, surprisingly little is known about which frequencies preferentially evoke rapid reaching responses. Here, we systematically varied the spatial frequency of peripheral reach targets while measuring EMG activity on an upper limb muscle. We found that visual stimuli composed of low-spatial frequencies elicit the most rapid and robust EMG responses and corrective reaches. Thus, when time is of the essence, low spatial frequencies preferentially drive fast visuomotor responses.",

    "abstract": "The number of plant species with genomic and transcriptomic data has been increasing rapidly. The grasses - Poaceae - have been well represented among species with published reference genomes. However, as a result the genomes of wild grasses are less frequently targeted by sequencing efforts. Sequence data from wild relatives of crop species in the grasses can aid the study of domestication, gene discovery for breeding and crop improvement, and improve our understanding of the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Here we used long read sequencing technology to characterize the transcriptomes of three C3 panicoid grass species: Dichanthelium oligosanthes, Chasmanthium laxum, and Hymenachne amplexicaulis. Based on alignments to the sorghum genome we estimate that assembled consensus transcripts from each species capture between 54.2 and 65.7% of the conserved syntenic gene space in grasses. Genes co-opted into C4 were also well represented in this dataset, despite concerns that, because these genes might play roles unrelated to photosynthesis in the target species, they would be expressed at low levels and missed by transcript-based sequencing. A combined analysis using syntenic orthologous genes from grasses with published reference genomes and consensus long read sequences from these wild species was consistent with previously published phylogenies. It is hoped that this data, targeting under represented classes of species within the PACMAD grasses - wild species and species utilizing C3 photosynthesis - will aid in futurue studies of domestication and C4 evolution by decreasing the evolutionary distance between C4 and C3 species within this clade, enabling more accurate comparisons associated with evolution of the C4 pathway.",

The second state is characterized by the absence of the peculiar non-Watson-Crick interactions in the loop region. By using machine learning techniques we identify a set of experimental measurements that are most sensitive to the presence of non-native states. We find that although our MD ensemble, as well as the consensus UUCG tetraloop structures, are in good agreement with experiments, there are remaining discrepancies. Together, our results show that i) the structural interpretation of experimental data for dynamic RNAs is highly complex, even for a simple model system such as the UUCG tetraloop ii) the MD simulation overstabilize a non-native loop conformation, and iii) eNOE data support its presence with a population of {approx}10%.",

    "abstract": "There is circumstantial evidence that, under neurodegenerative conditions, peptides deriving from aggregated or misfolded specific proteins elicit adaptive immune responses. On another hand, several genes involved in familial forms of neurodegenerative diseases were found to exert key innate immune functions. However, whether or not such observations are causally linked remains unknown. To start addressing this issue, we followed a systems biology strategy based on the mining of large proteomics and immunopeptidomics databases. First, we retrieved the expression patterns of common neurodegeneration-associated proteins in two professional antigen-presenting cells, namely B-cells and dendritic cells. Surprisingly, we found that under physiological conditions, numerous neurodegeneration-associated proteins are abundantly expressed by human B-cells. A survey of the human proteome allowed us to map a unique protein-protein interaction network linking common neurodegeneration-associated proteins and their first shell interactors in human B-cells. Surprisingly, network connectivity analysis identified two major hubs that both relate with inflammation and autophagy, namely TRAF6 (TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6) and SQSTM1 (Sequestosome-1). Moreover, the mapped network in B-cells also comprised two other hub proteins involved in both inflammation and autoimmunity: HSPA8 (Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 also known as HSC70) and HSP90AA1 (Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family Class A Member 1). Based on these results, we then explored the Immune Epitope Database \\\"IEDB-AR\\\" and actually found that a large share of neurodegeneration-associated proteins were previously reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B-cells. Of note, peptides deriving from amyloid beta A4 protein, sequestosome-1 or profilin-1 were reported to bind multiple allele-specific MHC class II molecules. In contrast, peptides deriving from microtubule-associated protein tau, presenilin 2 and serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 were exclusively reported to bind MHC molecules encoded by the HLA-DRB1 1501 allele, a recently-identified susceptibility gene for late onset Alzheimers disease. Finally, we observed that the whole list of proteins reported to provide endogenous MHC class II-binding peptides in human B-cells is specifically enriched in neurodegeneration-associated proteins. Overall, our work indicates that immunization against neurodegeneration-associated proteins might be a physiological process which is shaped, at least in part, by B-cells.",

It has been hypothesized that sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders are manifestations of differences in basic reward processing. However, preclinical models often present rewards in isolation, ignoring that ethologically, reward seeking requires the consideration of potential aversive outcomes.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a Multidimensional Cue Outcome Action Task (MCOAT) to dissociate motivated action from cue learning and valence. Mice are trained in a series of operant tasks. In phase 1, mice acquire positive and negative reinforcement in the presence of discrete discriminative stimuli. In phase 2, both discriminative stimuli are presented concurrently allowing us to parse innate behavioral strategies based on reward seeking and shock avoidance. Phase 3 is punished responding where a discriminative stimulus predicts that nose-poking for sucrose occurs concurrently with footshock, allowing for the assessment of how positive and negative outcomes are relatively valued.\\n\\nResultsFemales prioritize avoidance of negative outcomes over seeking positive, while males have the opposite strategy. In cases where rules are uncertain, males and females employ different strategies, with females demonstrating bias for shock avoidance.\\n\\nConclusionsThe MCOAT has broad utility for neuroscience research where pairing this task with recording and manipulation techniques will allow for the definition of the discrete information encoded within cellular populations. Ultimately, we show that making conclusions from unidimensional data leads to inaccurate generalizations about sex-specific behaviors that do not accurately represent ground truth.",

    "abstract": "In many insects, the Y chromosome plays a key role in sexual determination and male fertility. The Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans has 22 autosomal chromosomes and a pair of XY sex chromosomes. However, the knowledge on the Y chromosome of this species, its genetic content or its biological function, is very poor. Due to repetitive DNA, Y chromosome sequences are poorly assembled in genome projects, hindering structural and functional studies on Y-linked genes. Our group has developed many of the bioinformatic tools to identify Y-linked sequences in assembled genomes. Here, we describe the identification of a {gamma}-dynein heavy chain linked to the Y-chromosome of T. infestans. This protein is orthologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked gene kl-3. In D. melanogaster, dyneins of the Y chromosome are known as male fertility factors and their deletion causes male infertility. We performed knockdown of the kl-3 expression to ascertain its function in T. infestans. Our results showed that injection of dsKL3 reduced, significantly, the fertility of T. infestans males (p<0.01). The mean number of eggs laid by the control group was 35.64 eggs/couple while the kl-3 knockdown group was of 11.82 eggs/couple (five couples did not lay any eggs). Differences in eclosion rate was even more significant, with a hatching mean rate of 16.85{+/-}10.03 and 1.69{+/-}3.58 (p<0.001) for the control and the silenced groups respectively. Our results suggest that kl-3 maintains its functional role as essential for male fertility in T. infestans. Hence, it seems that the Y-chromosome of T. infestans has a key role in male fertility. This is the first report of a kl-3 orthologue linked to the Y chromosome of an insect species outside the diptera clade. In addition to the first report of a Y-linked gene in T. infestans with a role for male fertility, this finding is of great relevance for the study of the evolution of Y chromosomes and further studies that could lead to novel approaches in insect control.",

SR is transmitted to up to 100% of offspring, causing extreme sex ratio bias. SR in several species is found in a stable polymorphism at a moderate frequency, suggesting there must be strong frequency-dependent selection resisting its spread. We investigate the effect of SR on female and male egg-to-adult viability in the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. SR meiotic drive in this species is old, and appears to be broadly stable at a moderate (~20%) frequency. We use large-scale controlled crosses to estimate the strength of selection acting against SR in female and male carriers. We find that SR reduces the egg-to-adult viability of both sexes. In females, homozygous females experience greater reduction in viability (sf = 0.242) and the deleterious effects of SR are additive ([h] = 0.511). The male deficit in viability (sm = 0.214) is not different from that in homozygous females. The evidence does not support the expectation that deleterious side-effects of SR are recessive or sex-limited.

    "abstract": "Elucidating genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) and partitioning its contribution to the phenotypic variation remains a long standing challenge for plant scientists. Recent quantitative genetic frameworks have improved predictions of Gx E responses. However, these models do not explicitly consider the processes that give rise to GxE. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework to elucidate the genetic basis of dynamic shoot growth trajectories under contrasting water regimes using genome-wide markers to model genotype-specific shoot growth trajectories as a function of soil water availability. A rice diversity panel was phenotyped daily over a period of twenty-one days during the early vegetative stage using an automated, high-throughput image-based, phenotyping platform that enabled us to estimate daily shoot biomass and soil water content. Using these data, we modeled shoot growth as a function of time and soil water content, and were able to determine the soil water content and/or time point where an inflection in the growth trajectory occurred. We found that larger, more vigorous plants tend to exhibit an earlier repression in growth compared to smaller, slow growing plants, indicating a potential trade off between early vigor and tolerance to prolonged water deficits. We integrated the growth model within a hierarchical Bayesian framework and used marker information to estimate model parameters and the associated loci through genome-wide association analysis. Genomic inference for model parameters and time of inflection (TOI) identified several candidate genes. Among them an aquaporin, OsPIP1;1 was identified as a candidate for time of inflection under drought and showed significantly lower expression in accessions exhibiting later TOI in drought. This study is the first to utilize a genome-enabled growth model to study drought responses in rice, and presents a new approach to jointly model dynamic morpho-physiological responses and environmental covariates.",

Phagocytic killing and feeding by P. aurantium is highly effective for the third major fungal pathogen, C. parapsilosis. Here we show that the different prey patterns of the three yeasts were reflected by distinct transcriptional responses, indicating fungal copper and redox homeostasis as primary targets during intracellular killing of C. parapsilosis. Gene deletions in this fungus for the highly expressed copper exporter Crp1 and the peroxiredoxin Prx1 confirmed their role in copper and redox homeostasis, respectively and identified methionine biosynthesis as a ROS sensitive metabolic target during predation. Both, intact Cu export and redox homeostasis contributed to the survival of C. parapsilosis not only when encountering P. aurantium, but also in the presence of human macrophages. As both genes were found to be widely conserved within the entire Candida clade, our results suggest that they could be part of a basic tool-kit to survive phagocytic attacks by environmental predators.",

It is currently unknown how conserved and significant ckRNAi is for microbial virulence. Here, we found for the first time that sRNAs of a pathogen representing the oomycete kingdom invade the host plants Argonaute (AGO)/RNA-induced silencing complex. To demonstrate the functionality of the plant-invading oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis sRNAs (HpasRNAs), we designed a novel CRISPR endoribonuclease Csy4/GUS repressor reporter to visualize in situ pathogen-induced target suppression in Arabidopsis thaliana host plant. By using 5 RACE-PCR we demonstrated HpasRNAs-directed cleavage of plant mRNAs. The significant role of HpasRNAs together with AtAGO1 in virulence was demonstrated by plant atago1 mutants and by transgenic Arabidopsis expressing a target mimic to block HpasRNAs, that both exhibited enhanced resistance. Individual HpasRNA plant targets contributed to host immunity, as Arabidopsis gene knockout or HpasRNA-resistant gene versions exhibited quantitative enhanced or reduced susceptibility, respectively. Together with previous reports, we found that ckRNAi is conserved among oomycete and fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a systemic disease clinically defined by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While alterations in the gut microbiome composition have been reported in PD, their functional consequences remain unclear. Herein, we first analysed the gut microbiome of patients and healthy controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples from the Luxembourg Parkinsons study (n=147 typical PD cases, n=162 controls). All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting questionnaires. Second, we predicted the potential secretion for 129 microbial metabolites through personalised metabolic modelling using the microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microbes. Our key results include: 1. eight genera and nine species changed significantly in their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy controls. 2. PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and constipation. The relative abundances of Bilophila and Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging after controlling for the disease duration. In contrast, dopaminergic medication had no detectable effect on the PD microbiome composition. 3. Personalised metabolic modelling of the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in secretion potential of nine microbial metabolites in PD, including increased methionine and cysteinylglycine. The microbial pantothenic acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific non-motor symptoms and attributed to individual bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wardswarthia. Our results suggest that PD-associated alterations of gut microbiome could translate into functional differences affecting host metabolism and disease phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a growing health concern. Enterobacteria, including Escherichia coli, bloom to high levels in the gut during inflammation and strongly contribute to the pathology of IBDs. To survive in the inflamed gut, E. coli must tolerate high levels of antimicrobial compounds produced by the immune system, including toxic metals like copper and reactive chlorine oxidants like hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In this work, we show that the widely-conserved bacterial HOCl resistance enzyme RclA catalyzes the reduction of copper (II) to copper (I), and specifically protects E. coli against the combination of HOCl and intracellular copper, probably by preventing Cu(III) accumulation. E. coli lacking RclA were highly sensitive to HOCl and were defective in colonizing an animal host. Our results indicate unexpected complexity in the interactions between antimicrobial toxins produced by innate immune cells and suggest an important and previously unsuspected role for copper redox reactions during inflammation.",

Sleep deprivation and chronic restriction of sleep cause perturbations of circadian rhythmicity and degradation of waking alertness as reflected in attention, cognitive efficiency and memory. In this work we report on multiple neurobehavioral correlates of sleep loss in healthy adults in an unprecedented study comprising 21 consecutive days divided into periods of 4 days of regular life (a baseline), 10 days of chronic partial sleep restriction and 7 days of recovery. Throughout the whole experiment we continuously measured the spontaneous locomotor activity by means of actigraphy with 1-minute resolution in two acquisition modes (frequency and intensity of movement). Moreover, on daily basis the subjects were undergoing EEG measurements (64-electrodes with 500 Hz sampling frequency): resting state with eyes open and closed (RS; 8 minutes long each) followed by Stroop task (ST; 22 minutes). Altogether we analyzed actigraphy (distributions of rest and activity durations), behavioral measures (accuracy and reaction times from Stroop task) and EEG (amplitudes, latencies and scalp maps of event-related potentials from Stroop task and power spectra from resting states). The actigraphy measures clearly indicate rapid changes after sleep restriction onset, confirming our former investigations -- the novel insight is a slow and incomplete relaxation to the original locomotor behavior. The pattern of partial recovery appears also in accuracy (in ST) and power of delta rhythm (in RS). The impact of sleep loss is also evident in reaction times (in ST), yet followed by complete recovery, and finally in ERP amplitudes and latencies, which however did not return to the baseline at all. The results indicate that short periods (a few days) of recovery sleep subsequent to prolonged periods of sleep restriction are overall insufficient to recover fully.",

Energy metabolism in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was recently related to hierarchical status and vulnerability to develop depression-like behavior. Acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), a mitochondria-boosting supplement, has shown promising antidepressant-like effects opening promising therapeutic strategies for restoring energy balance in depressed patients. Here, we investigated the metabolic impact in the NAc of antidepressant LAC treatment in chronically stressed mice.\\n\\nMethodMice were characterized for emotional behaviors and social rank. They were then exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 21 days and subsequently tested in a social behavior (SB) test. A group of mice was also given LAC supplementation during the 7 last CRS days. Mice were then tested in the SB and forced swim tests (FST) and scanned in vivo using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to quantitatively assess the NAc neurochemical profile.\\n\\nResultsDominant, but not subordinate, mice showed behavioral vulnerability to CRS. In the NAc, dominant mice showed reduced levels of several energy-related metabolites. LAC treatment counteracted stress-induced behavioral changes in dominant mice, and normalized levels of taurine, phosphocreatine, glutamine and phosphocholine in the NAc. No major accumbal metabolic changes were observed in subordinate mice.\\n\\nConclusionHigh social rank is confirmed as a vulnerability factor to develop chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. We reveal a metabolic signature in the NAc for the antidepressant-like effects of LAC in vulnerable mice, characterized by restoration of stress-induced alterations in neuroenergetics and lipid function.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic divergence between closely related species has long interested biologists. Taxa that inhabit a range of environments and have known and diverse, natural histories, can help understand how different selection pressures shape diverging traits. In butterflies, wing colour patterns have been extensively studied, whereas wing shape diversity is less well understood despite its importance for flight. Here we study a measure of wing shape, aspect ratio, and wing size in a large dataset of over 3200 individuals, representing 13 Heliconius species, from across the Neotropics. We assess the relative importance of phylogenetic relatedness, natural history and habitat in determining wing shape and size. We find that both larval and adult behavioural ecology affect patterns of adult size dimorphisms. On one hand, species with solitary larvae have larger adult males, in contrast to gregarious Heliconius species, and indeed most Lepidoptera. On the other hand, species in the pupal-mating clade are smaller overall than those in the adult-mating clade. Interestingly, while controlling for phylogeny, sex ratios and allometry, we find that species inhabiting higher altitudes have rounder wings and, in one of the two major Heliconius clades, are also bigger in size than their lowland relatives. Thus, we reveal novel adaptive wing morphological divergence among Heliconius species beyond that imposed by natural selection on aposematic wing colouration. Our study highlights the value of phylogenetic comparative methods in study systems that have diverse and well-studied natural histories to disentangle the selection pressures shaping adaptive phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which RNA molecules decay is a key determinant of cellular RNA concentrations, yet current approaches for measuring RNA half-lives are generally labor-intensive, limited in sensitivity, and/or disruptive to normal cellular processes. Here we introduce a simple method for estimating relative RNA half-lives that is based on two standard and widely available high-throughput assays: Precision Run-On and sequencing (PRO-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our method treats PRO-seq as a measure of transcription rate and RNA-seq as a measure of RNA concentration, and estimates the rate of RNA decay required for a steady-state equilibrium. We show that this approach can be used to assay relative RNA half-lives genome-wide, with good accuracy and sensitivity for both coding and noncoding transcription units. Using a structural equation model (SEM), we test several features of transcription units, nearby DNA sequences, and nearby epigenomic marks for associations with RNA stability after controlling for their effects on transcription. We find that RNA splicing-related features are positively correlated with RNA stability, whereas features related to miRNA binding, DNA methylation, and G+C-richness are negatively correlated with RNA stability. Furthermore, we find that a measure based on U1-binding and polyadenylation sites distinguishes between unstable noncoding and stable coding transcripts but is not predictive of relative stability within the mRNA or lincRNA classes. We also identify several histone modifications that are associated with RNA stability. Together, our estimation method and systematic analysis shed light on the pervasive impacts of RNA stability on cellular RNA concentrations.",

Using Calu-3 cells grown in air-interfaced culture, we studied the meningococcal colonization of the mucus and the host response. Our results suggested that N. meningitidis behaved like commensal bacteria in mucus, without interacting with human cells or actively transmigrating through the cell layer. As such, meningococci did not trigger a strong innate immune response from the Calu-3 cells. Finally, we have shown that this model is suitable for studying interaction of N. meningitidis with other bacteria living in the nasopharynx, and that Streptococcus mitis but not Moraxella catarrhalis can promote meningococcal growth in this model.",

    "abstract": "The major function of Polycomb group proteins (PcG) is to maintain transcriptional repression to preserve cellular identity. This is exerted by two distinct repressive complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, that modify histones by depositing H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively. Both complexes are essential for development and are deregulated in several types of human tumors. PRC1 and PRC2 exist in different variants and show a complex regulatory cross-talk. However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Coupling an inducible system with the expression of a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target genes repressed in ESC. Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This affected both PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 variants and further correlated with a strong displacement and destabilization of canonical PRC1. Finally, we find that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as central hub that mount PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity.",

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations have been related to many aspects of human behavior. To understand a potential causal relationship, it is of great importance to develop methods for modulating ongoing neural activity. It has been shown that external rhythmic stimulation leads to an oscillatory brain response that follows the temporal structure of the presented stimulus and is assumed to reflect the synchronization of ongoing neural oscillations with the stimulation rhythm. This interaction between individual brain activity and so called steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) is the fundamental requirement of neural entrainment. Here, we investigate whether neural responses to rhythmic vibrotactile stimulation, measured with EEG, are dependent on ongoing individual brain oscillations, and therefore reflect entrained oscillatory activity. For this, we measured phase synchronization in response to rhythmic stimulation across various frequencies in the alpha and beta band. Three different stimulation intensities were applied for each frequency relative to the individual sensory threshold. We found that a higher stimulation intensity, compared to lower intensities, resulted in a more pronounced phase synchronization with the stimulation signal. Moreover, EEG responses to low stimulation frequencies closer to individual beta peak frequencies revealed a higher degree of entrainment, compared to stimulation conditions with frequencies that were more distant to endogenous oscillations. Our findings provide evidence that the efficacy of vibrotactile rhythmic beta stimulation to evoke a SSEPs is dependent on ongoing brain oscillations.",

Using micro-computed tomography ({micro}CT) scanning and 3D image analysis, we compared brain development for multiple neuropils in workers 3 and 12-days post-emergence. Mushroom body calyces were the neuropils most affected by exposure during either of the developmental phases, with both age cohorts showing smaller structural volumes. Critically, reduced calyces growth in pesticide exposed workers was associated with lower responsiveness to a sucrose reward and impaired learning performance.

The presented work confirms that total TG and CE content is significantly higher in SW620 cells. Moreover, the FA-composition of TGs is significantly altered in SW620 cells, with significant decrease in the abundance of saturated triglycerides. This resulted in significantly decreased TG saturation index in SW620 cells. The saturation index of CEs was also significantly decreased in SW620 cells.

    "abstract": "Live-cell fluorescence nanoscopy is a powerful tool to study cellular biology on a molecular scale, yet its use is held back by the paucity of suitable fluorescent probes. Fluorescent probes based on regular fluorophores usually suffer from low cell permeability and unspecific background signal. We report a general strategy to transform regular fluorophores into fluorogenic probes with excellent cell permeability and low unspecific background signal. The strategy is based on the conversion of a carboxyl group found in rhodamines and related fluorophores into an electron-deficient amide. This conversion does not affect the spectroscopic properties of the fluorophore but permits it to exist in a dynamic equilibrium between two different forms: a fluorescent zwitterion and a non-fluorescent, cell permeable spirolactam. Probes based on such fluorophores generally are fluorogenic as the equilibrium shifts towards the fluorescent form when the probe binds to its cellular targets. The resulting increase in fluorescence can be up to 1000-fold. Using this simple design principle we created fluorogenic probes in various colours for different cellular targets for wash-free, multicolour, live-cell nanoscopy. The work establishes a general strategy to develop fluorogenic probes for live-cell bioimaging.",

    "abstract": "Fumarate hydratase (FH) is a metabolic enzyme that is part of the Krebs-cycle, and reversibly catalyzes the hydration of fumarate to malate. Mutations of the FH gene have been associated with fumarate hydratase deficiency (FHD), hereditary leiomyomatosis, renal cell cancer (HLRCC), and other diseases. Currently there are no high-quality small molecule probes for studying human fumarate hydratase. To address this, we developed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) FH assay and screened a total of 57,037 compounds from in-house libraries in dose-response. While no inhibitors of FH were confirmed, a series of phenyl-pyrrolo-pyrimidine-diones were identified as activators of human fumarate hydratase. These compounds were not substrates of fumarate hydratase, were inactive in a malate dehydrogenase counter screen, and showed no detectable reduction-oxidation activity. The binding of two compounds from the series to human fumarate hydratase was confirmed by microscale thermophoresis. The low hit rate in this screening campaign confirmed that FH is a  tough target to modulate, and the small molecule activators of human fumarate hydratase reported here may serve as a starting point for further optimization and development into cellular probes of human FH and potential drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "The reaction mechanism by which shelterin protein POT1 (Protection of Telomeres) unfolds human telomeric G-quadruplex structures is not fully understood. We report here kinetic, thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and computational studies that show that a conformational selection mechanism, in which POT1 binding is coupled to an obligatory unfolding reaction, is the most plausible mechanism. We show that binding of the single-strand oligonucleotide d[TTAGGGTTAG] to POT1 is fast, with an apparent relaxation time of 80.0 {+/-} 0.4 ms, and strong, with a binding free energy of -10.1 {+/-} 0.3 kcal mol-1. That favourable free energy arises from a large favourable enthalpy contribution of -38.2 {+/-} 0.3 kcal mol-1. In sharp contrast, the binding of POT1 to an initially folded 24 nt G-quadruplex structure is slow, with an average relaxation time of 2000-3000 s. Fluorescence, circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that POT1 binding is coupled to quadruplex unfolding with a final stoichiometry of 2 POT1 molecules bound per 24 nt DNA. The binding isotherm for the POT1-quadruplex binding interaction is sigmoidal, indicative of a complex reaction. A conformational selection model that includes equilibrium constants for both G-quadruplex unfolding and POT1 binding to the resultant single-strand provides an excellent quantitative fit to the experimental binding data. The overall favourable free energy of the POT1-quadruplex interaction is -7.1 kcal mol-1, which arises from a balance between unfavourable free energy of +3.4 kcal mol-1 for quadruplex unfolding and a large, favorable free energy of -10.5 kcal mol-1 for POT1 binding. We show that POT1 can unfold and bind to any conformational form of human telomeric G-quadruplex (antiparallel, hybrid or parallel), but will not interact with duplex DNA or with a parallel G-quadruplex structure formed by a c-myc promoter sequence. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations provide a detailed structural model of a 2:1 POT1:DNA complex that is fully consistent with experimental biophysical results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor. Mutations in the H3 histone tail (H3.1/3.3-K27M) are a feature of DIPG, potentially rendering them therapeutically sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of chromatin modifiers. Pharmacological inhibition of lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) shows promise in pediatric cancers such as Ewings sarcoma, but has not been investigated in DIPG, which was the aim of our study.\\n\\nMethodsPatient-derived DIPG cell lines and pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) datasets were used to evaluate effects of several LSD1 inhibitors on selective cytotoxicity and immune gene expression. Immune cell cytotoxicity was assessed in DIPG cells treated with LSD1 inhibitors and informatics platforms were used to determine immune infiltration of pHGG and impact on survival.\\n\\nResultsSelective cytotoxicity and an immunogenic gene signature was established in DIPG lines using several clinically-relevant LSD1 inhibitors. Pediatric high-grade glioma patient sequencing data demonstrated survival benefit using this LSD1-dependent gene signature. On-target binding of catalytic LSD1 inhibitors was confirmed in DIPG and pre-treatment of DIPG with these inhibitors increased lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. CIBERSORT analysis of patient data confirmed NK infiltration is beneficial to patient survival while CD8 T-cells are negatively prognostic. Catalytic LSD1 inhibitors are non-perturbing to NK cells while scaffolding LSD1 inhibitors are toxic to NK cells and do not induce the gene signature in DIPG cells.\\n\\nConclusionsLSD1 inhibition using catalytic inhibitors are both selectively cytotoxic and promote an immune gene signature that is associated with NK cell killing, representing a therapeutic opportunity for pHGG.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LILSD1 inhibition using several clinically relevant compounds is selectively cytotoxic in DIPG.\\nC_LIO_LIAn LSD1-controlled gene signature predicts survival in pediatric high-grade glioma patients.\\nC_LIO_LILSD1 inhibition enhances NK cell cytotoxicity against DIPG with correlative genetic biomarkers.\\nC_LI\\n\\nImportance of the studyThis is the first study to evaluate inhibition of LSD1 in a uniformly lethal type of pediatric brain tumor: DIPG. We demonstrate selective cytotoxicity of several clinically relevant compounds against patient derived DIPG cells, and identify an immune gene signature that is upregulated in DIPG cells by catalytic inhibitors of LSD1. This immune gene signature is predictive of prognosis in pHGG, consistent with the rationale of promoting this signature through LSD1 inhibition. NK cell killing of DIPG is enhanced by LSD1 inhibition, providing functional confirmation of this gene signature, and represents the first report of LSD1 inhibition promoting NK cell cytotoxicity of cancer cells. Given the poor prognosis of pHGGs and lack of effective treatments, our results suggest use of LSD1 inhibition as a single agent or in combination with NK cell therapy may be a safe and efficacious strategy.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNrf2 overexpression confers poor prognosis in some cancers but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Due to its role as a transcription factor we hypothesise a metagene of NRF2 regulated genes could act as a prognostic biomarker in CRC.\\n\\nDesignUsing known NRF2 regulated genes, we defined an NRF2 metagene to represent the pathway expression using principal component analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. The NRF2 metagene was validated in four independent datasets, including the recently profiled MRC FOCUS randomised controlled trial.\\n\\nResults36 genes comprised the final prognostic metagene in the training set. 1,360 patients were included in the validation analyses. High NRF2 metagene expression is associated with worse disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes in stage I/II/III disease and worse OS in stage IV disease. In multivariate analyses, NRF2 expression remained significant when adjusted for known prognostic factors of adjuvant chemotherapy and stage in stage I/II/III disease, as well as BRAF V600E mutation and sidedness in stage IV disease. NRF2 metagene expression exhibits variation within each of the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) but high expression is particularly enriched in CMS 4.\\n\\nConclusionWe demonstrate in a large scale analysis that NRF2 expression is a novel biomarker of poor prognosis across all stages of colorectal cancer. Higher expression observed in CMS 4 further refines the molecular taxonomy of colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Biological and biochemical functions of immunity transcription factor NF-{kappa}B in basal metazoans are largely unknown. Herein, we characterize transcription factor NF-{kappa}B from the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Aq), in the phylum Porifera. Structurally and phylogenetically, the Aq-NF-{kappa}B protein is most similar to NF-{kappa}B p100 and p105 among vertebrate proteins, with an N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain, a C-terminal Ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain, and a DNA binding-site profile more similar to human NF-{kappa}B proteins than Rel proteins. Aq-NF-{kappa}B also resembles the mammalian NF-{kappa}B protein p100 in that C-terminal truncation results in translocation of Aq-NF-{kappa}B to the nucleus and increases its transcriptional activation activity. Overexpression of a human or sea anemone I{kappa}B kinase (IKK) can induce C-terminal processing of Aq-NF-{kappa}B in vivo, and this processing requires C-terminal serine residues in Aq-NF-{kappa}B. Unlike human NF-{kappa}B p100, however, the C-terminal sequences of Aq-NF-{kappa}B do not effectively inhibit its DNA-binding activity when expressed in human cells. Tissue of another demosponge, a black encrusting sponge, contains NF-{kappa}B site DNA-binding activity and an NF-{kappa}B protein that appears mostly processed and in the nucleus of cells. NF-{kappa}B DNA-binding activity and processing is increased by treatment of sponge tissue with LPS. By transcriptomic analysis of A. queenslandica we identified likely homologs to many upstream NF-{kappa}B pathway components. These results present a functional characterization of the most ancient metazoan NF-{kappa}B protein to date, and show that many characteristics of mammalian NF-{kappa}B are conserved in sponge NF-{kappa}B, but the mechanism by which NF-{kappa}B functions and is regulated in the sponge may be somewhat different.",

    "abstract": "Atypical regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a putative mechanism underlying the association between exposure to early life stress (ELS) and the subsequent development of mental and physical health difficulties. Recent research indicates that puberty is a period of HPA-axis plasticity during which the effects of exposure to ELS on cortisol regulation may change. In particular, increases in the sex hormones that drive pubertal maturation, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone, may be implicated in pubertal recalibration of cortisol regulation. In the current study, we examined the associations among levels of objectively-rated threat-related ELS and salivary waking cortisol, DHEA, and testosterone in a sample of 178 adolescents (55% female) who were in early puberty at baseline (Tanner stages 1-3; mean Tanner stage[SD]=1.93[0.64]; mean age[SD]=11.42[1.04]) and were followed up approximately two years later (mean Tanner stage[SD]=3.46[0.86]; mean age[SD]=13.38[1.06]). Using multi-level modeling, we disaggregated the effects of between-individual levels and within-individual increases in pubertal stage and sex hormones on change in cortisol. Controlling for between-individual differences in average pubertal stage, the association between levels of cortisol and DHEA was more strongly positive among adolescents who evidenced greater within-individual increases in pubertal stage across time. Both higher average levels and greater within-individual increases in DHEA and testosterone were associated with increases in cortisol across time, indicating positive coupling of developmental changes in these hormones; however, coupling was attenuated in adolescents who were exposed to more severe threat-related ELS prior to puberty. These findings advance our understanding of the development of the HPA-axis and its association with childhood environmental risk during puberty.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts between the replication and transcription machineries have profound effects on chromosome duplication, genome organization, as well as evolution across species. Head-on conflicts (lagging strand genes) are significantly more detrimental than co-directional conflicts (leading strand genes). The source of this fundamental difference is unknown. Here, we report that topological stress underlies this difference. We find that head-on conflict resolution requires the relaxation of positive supercoils DNA gyrase and Topo IV. Interestingly, we find that after positive supercoil resolution, gyrase introduces excessive negative supercoils at head-on conflict regions, driving pervasive R-loop formation. The formation of these R-Loops through gyrase activity is most likely caused by the diffusion of negative supercoils through RNA polymerase spinning. Altogether, our results address a longstanding question regarding replication-transcription conflicts by revealing the fundamental mechanistic difference between the two types of encounters.",

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels are highly conserved, polymodal sensors which respond to a wide variety of stimuli. Perhaps most notably, TRP channels serve critical functions in nociception and pain. A growing body of evidence suggests that TRPM (Melastatin) and TRPA (Ankyrin) thermal and electrophile sensitivities predate the protostome-deuterostome split (>550 million years ago). However, TRPM and TRPA channels are also thought to detect modified terpenes (e.g., menthol). Although terpenoids like menthol are thought to be aversive and/or harmful to insects, mechanistic sensitivity studies have been largely restricted to chordates. Furthermore, it is unknown if TRP-menthol sensing is as ancient as thermal and/or electrophile sensitivity. Combining genetic, optical, electrophysiological, behavioural, and phylogenetic approaches, we tested the hypothesis that insect TRP channels play a conserved role in menthol sensing. We found that topical application of menthol to Drosophila melanogaster larvae elicits a Trpm- and TrpA1-dependent nocifensive rolling behaviour, which requires activation of Class IV nociceptor neurons. Further, in characterizing the evolution of TRP channels, we put forth the hypotheses that 3 previously undescribed TRPM channel clades (basal, TRPM, and {beta}TRPM), as well as TRPs with residues critical for menthol sensing, were present in ancestral bilaterians.",
