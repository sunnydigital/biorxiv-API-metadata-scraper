    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "Self-renewal and lineage regulation of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain (aNSCs) are still far from been understood. Although previous studies have reported that some aNSCs in neurogenic niches showed irregular nuclei, their functional significance remains elusive. We used neural crest-derived human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) as an in vitro cell model of neurogenesis to investigate the functional significance of nuclear polymorphisms. Here, we show that hPDLSCs-derived neurons are not directly generated through cell division from stem cells. In fact, the cell shape of neural precursors is reset and start their neuronal development as round spheres. The hPDLSCs-derived neurons gradually adopted a complex morphology by forming several processes, that grew and arborized, adquiring dendritic-like and axonal-like identities, giving rise to a variety of neuron-like morphologies. To our knowledge, this article provides the first observation of these morphological events during in vitro neurogenesis and neuron polarization in human aNCSCs, and we have discovered a transient cell nuclei lobulation coincident to in vitro neurogenesis, without being related to cell proliferation. We observed that small DNA containing structures move within the cell to specific directions and temporarily form lobed nuclei. Morphological analysis also reveals that neurogenic niches in the adult mouse brain contains cells with nuclear shapes highly similar to those observed during in vitro neurogenesis from hPDLSCs. Our results provide strong evidence that neuronal differentiation from aNSCs may also occur during in vivo adult mammalian neurogenesis without being related to cell proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate that hPDLSCs-derived neurons display a sequence of morphologic development highly similar to those observed in primary neuronal cultures derived from rodent brains during neurogenesis, providing strong evidence that it is possible to reproduce neurogenic processes and obtain neurons from hPDLSCs. Beyond the central nervous system, the presence of lobed nuclei has been reported in most blood and immune cells, but the functional significance of multilobed nuclear structures is not yet stablished. Our results suggest that multilobed nuclear structures is associated to nuclear movement within the cell.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have recently achieved many successes in solving sequential processing and planning tasks. Their success is often ascribed to the emergence of the tasks low-dimensional latent structure in the network activity - i.e., in the learned neural representations. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that a means for generating representations with easily accessed low-dimensional latent structure, possibly reflecting an underlying semantic organization, is through learning to predict observations about the world. Specifically, we ask whether and when network mechanisms for sensory prediction coincide with those for extracting the underlying latent variables. Using a recurrent neural network model trained to predict a sequence of observations we show that network dynamics exhibit low-dimensional but nonlinearly transformed representations of sensory inputs that map the latent structure of the sensory environment. We quantify these results using nonlinear measures of intrinsic dimensionality and linear decodability of latent variables, and provide mathematical arguments for why such useful predictive representations emerge. We focus throughout on how our results can aid the analysis and interpretation of experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is essential for growth, development and defense but, how low N affects defense and the role of Trichoderma in enhancing defense under low nitrate is not known. Low nitrate fed Arabidopsis plants displayed reduced growth and compromised local and systemic acquired resistance responses when infected with both avirulent and virulent Pseudomonas syringae DC3000. These responses were enhanced in the presence of Trichoderma. The mechanism of increased local and systemic acquired resistance mediated by Trichoderma involved increased N uptake and enhanced protein levels via modulation of nitrate transporter genes. The nrt2.1 mutant is compromised in local and systemic acquired resistance responses suggesting a link between enhanced N transport and defense. Enhanced N uptake was mediated by Trichoderma elicited nitric oxide (NO). Low NO producing nia1,2 mutant and nsHb+ over expressing lines were unable to induce nitrate transporters and thereby compromised defense in the presence of Trichoderma under low N suggesting a signaling role of Trichoderma elicited NO. Trichoderma also induced SA and defense gene expression under low N. The SA deficient NahG transgenic line and the npr1 mutant were also compromised in Trichoderma-mediated local and systemic acquired resistance responses. Collectively our results indicated that the mechanism of enhanced plant defense under low N mediated by Trichoderma involves NO, ROS, SA production as well as the induction of NRT and marker genes for systemic acquired resistance.\n\nOne-sentence summaryTrichoderma enhances local and systemic acquired resistance under low nitrate nutrition",

Despite rapid and widespread growth of this approach, at present we lack neuroimaging processing pipelines suited to address the unique challenges inherent in this data type. Here, we solve the most challenging processing step, rapid and accurate isolation of the fetal brain from surrounding tissue across thousands of non-stationary 3D brain volumes. Leveraging our library of 1,241 manually traced fetal fMRI images from 207 fetuses (gestational age 24-39 weeks, M=30.9, SD=4.2), we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved excellent performance across two held-out test sets from separate scanners and populations. Furthermore, we unite the auto-masking model with additional fMRI preprocessing steps from existing software and provide insight into our adaptation of each step. This work represents an initial advancement towards a fully comprehensive, open source workflow for fetal functional MRI data preprocessing.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of biological communities by marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing are biased: The measured relative abundances of taxa or their genes are systematically distorted from their true values because each step in the experimental workflow preferentially detects some taxa over others. Bias can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions and makes measurements from different protocols quantitatively incomparable. A rigorous understanding of bias is therefore essential. Here we propose, test, and apply a simple mathematical model of how bias distorts marker-gene and metagenomics measurements: Bias multiplies the true relative abundances within each sample by taxon-and protocol-specific factors that describe the different efficiencies with which taxa are detected by the workflow. Critically, these factors are consistent across samples with different compositions, allowing bias to be estimated and corrected. We validate this model in 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from bacterial communities with defined compositions. We use it to reason about the effects of bias on downstream statistical analyses, finding that analyses based on taxon ratios are less sensitive to bias than analyses based on taxon proportions. Finally, we demonstrate how this model can be used to quantify bias from samples of defined composition, partition bias into steps such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification, and to correct biased measurements. Our model improves on previous models by providing a better fit to experimental data and by providing a composition-independent approach to analyzing, measuring, and correcting bias.",

    "abstract": "Priming refers to the influence that a previously encountered object exerts on future responses to similar objects. For many years, visual priming has been known as a facilitation and sometimes an inhibition effect that lasts for an extended period of time. It contrasts with the recent finding of an oscillated priming effect where facilitation and inhibition alternate over time periodically. Here we developed a computational model of visual priming that combines rhythmic sampling of the environment (attentional oscillation) with active preparation for future events (temporal expectation). Counterintuitively, it shows both the sustained and oscillated priming effects can emerge from an interaction between attentional oscillation and temporal expectation. The interaction also leads to novel predictions such as the change of visual priming effects with temporal expectation and attentional oscillation. Reanalysis of two published datasets and the results of two new experiments of visual priming tasks with male and female human participants provide support for the models relevance to human behavior. More generally, our model offers a new perspective that may unify the increasing findings of behavioral and neural oscillations with the classic findings in visual perception and attention.\n\nSignificance StatementThere is increasing behavioral and neural evidence that visual attention is a periodic process that sequentially samples different alternatives in the theta frequency range. It contrasts with the classic findings of sustained facilitatory or inhibitory attention effects. How can an oscillatory perceptual process give rise to sustained attention effects? Here we make this connection by proposing a computational model for a \"fruit fly\" visual priming task and showing both the sustained and oscillated priming effects can have the same origin: an interaction between rhythmic sampling of the environment and active preparation for future events. One unique contribution of our model is to predict how temporal contexts affects priming. It also opens up the possibility of reinterpreting other attention-related classic phenomena.",

We found that eIF3 deficiency reduced early ribosomal elongation speed between codons 25 and 75 on a set of [~]2,700 mRNAs encoding proteins associated with mitochondrial and membrane functions, resulting in defective synthesis of their encoded proteins. To promote elongation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes translating the first [~]60 codons and serves to recruit protein quality control factors, functions required for normal mitochondrial physiology. Accordingly, eIF3e+/- mice accumulate defective mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength.

    "abstract": "Changing environmental conditions can lead to population diversification through differential selection on standing genetic variation. Structural variant (SV) polymorphisms provide examples of ancient alleles that in time become associated with novel environmental gradients. The European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) is a marine flatfish showing large allele frequency differences at two putative SVs associated with environmental variation. In this study, we explored the contribution of these SVs to population structure across the North East Atlantic. We compared genome wide population structure using sets of RAD sequencing SNPs with the spatial structure of the SVs. We found that in contrast to the rest of the genome, the SVs were only weakly associated with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Indeed, both SVs showed important allele frequency differences associated with two different environmental gradients, with the same allele increasing both along the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, and the latitudinal gradient along the Norwegian coast. Nevertheless, both SVs were found to be polymorphic across most sampling sites, even in the Icelandic population inferred to originate from a different glacial refuge than the remaining populations from the European continental shelf. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the SV alleles are much older than the age of the Baltic Sea itself. These results suggest that the SVs are older than the age of the environmental gradients with which they currently co-vary. Interestingly, both SVs shared similar phylogenetic and genetic diversity, suggesting that they have a common origin. Altogether, our results suggest that the plaice SVs were shaped by evolutionary processes occurring at two time-frames, firstly following their common origin and secondly related to their current association with more recent environmental gradients such as those found in the North Sea - Baltic Sea transition zone.",

The E3 ligase Ltn1 adds ubiquitin and Rqc2 directs the large ribosomal subunit to append carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine residues (CAT tails). When excessive amounts of incomplete polypeptides evade Ltn1, CAT-tailed proteins accumulate and can self-associate into aggregates. CAT tail aggregation has been hypothesized to either protect cells by sequestering potentially toxic incomplete polypeptides or harm cells by disrupting protein homeostasis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we modulated CAT tail aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genetic and chemical tools to analyze CAT tails in aggregated and un-aggregated states. We found that enhancing CAT tail aggregation induces proteotoxic stress and antagonizes degradation of CAT-tailed proteins, while inhibiting aggregation reverses these effects. Our findings suggest that CAT tail aggregation harms RQC-compromised cells and that preventing aggregation can mitigate this toxicity.",

Frustration is thought to underpin biomolecular recognition and the flexibility of protein binding sites. Here we show how a small chemical modification, the oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a disulfide bond, during the catalytic cycle of the N-terminal domain of the key bacterial oxidoreductase DsbD (nDsbD), introduces frustration ultimately influencing protein function. In oxidized nDsbD, local frustration disrupts the packing of the protective cap-loop region against the active site allowing loop opening. By contrast, in reduced nDsbD the cap loop is rigid, always protecting the active-site thiols from the oxidizing environment of the periplasm. Our results point towards an intricate coupling between the dynamics of the active-site cysteines and of the cap loop which modulates the association reactions of nDsbD with its partners resulting in optimized protein function.",

It adopts the mixed precision training manner to improve the speed and performance, and predicts m6A sites only by directly reading the 3-mer encoding of the m6A short sequence. The cross-validation and independent test verification show SICM6A is more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods. This, therefore, makes SICM6A provide new idea for predicting other modification sites of RNA sequences. The prediction software SICM6A is on github (https://github.com/lwzyb/SICM6A).",

    "abstract": "Gene expression variation between alleles in a diploid cell is mediated by variation in cis regulatory sequences, which usually refers to the differences in DNA sequence between two alleles near the gene of interest. Expression differences caused by cis variation has been estimated by the ratio of the expression level of the two alleles under a binomial model. However, the binomial model underestimates the variance among replicated experiments resulting in the exaggerated statistical significance of estimated cis effects and thus many false discoveries of cis-affected genes. Here we describe a beta-binomial model that estimates the cis-effect for each gene while permitting overdispersion of variance among replicates. We demonstrated with simulated null data (data without true cis-effect) that the new model fits the true distribution better, resulting in approximately 5% false positive rate under 5% significance level in all null datasets, considerably better than the 6%-40% false positive rate of the binomial model. Additional replicates increase the performance of the beta-binomial model but not of the binomial model. We also collected new allele-specific expression data from an experiment comprised of 20 replicates of a yeast hybrid (YPS128/RM11-1a). We eliminated the mapping bias problem with de novo assemblies of the two parental genomes. By applying the beta-binomial model to this dataset, we found that cis effects are ubiquitous, affecting around 70% of genes. However, most of these changes are small in magnitude. The high number of replicates enabled us a better approximation of cis landscape within species and also provides a resource for future exploration for better models.",

    "abstract": "Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only autonomous retrotransposon active in human cells. L1s DNA makes about 17% of the human genome and retrotransposition of a few active L1 copies has been detected in various tumors, underscoring the potential role of L1 in mediating or increasing genome instability during tumorigenic development. Different host factors have been shown to influence L1 mobility through several mechanisms. However, systematic analyses of host factors affecting L1 retrotransposition are limited. Here, we developed a high-throughput microscopy-based retrotransposition assay and coupled it to a genome-wide siRNA knockdown screen to study the cellular regulators of L1 retrotransposition in human cells. We showed that L1 insertion frequency was stimulated by knockdown of Double-Stranded Break (DSB) repair factors that are active in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle including Homologous Recombination (HR), Fanconi Anemia (FA) and, to a less extent, microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) factors. In particular, we show that BRCA1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a key role in several DNA repair pathways, plays multiple roles in regulating L1; BRCA1 knockdown directly affects L1 retrotransposition frequency and structure and also plays a role in controlling L1 ORF2 protein translation through L1 mRNA binding. These results suggest the existence of a \\\"battle\\\" between HR factors and L1 retrotransposons, revealing a potential role for L1 in development of tumors characterized by BRCA1 and HR repair deficiencies.",

We now know that the core regulatory machinery is highly conserved in eukaryotes but how these multiple protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases are coordinated to remodel the cell in a matter of minutes remains a major question. Cyclin B-CDK is the primary kinase that drives mitotic remodelling and here we show that it is targeted to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by binding an acidic face of the spindle assembly checkpoint protein, MAD1. This localised Cyclin B1-CDK1 activity coordinates NPC disassembly with kinetochore assembly: it is needed for the proper release of MAD1 from the embrace of TPR at the nuclear pore, which enables MAD1 to be recruited to kinetochores before nuclear envelope breakdown, thereby strengthening the spindle assembly checkpoint to maintain genomic stability.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that mitochondria and actin filaments work together in two contexts: 1) increased cytoplasmic calcium induces cytoplasmic actin polymerization that stimulates mitochondrial fission, and 2) mitochondrial depolarization causes actin assembly around mitochondria, with roles in mitophagy. It is unclear whether these two processes utilize similar actin assembly mechanisms. Here, we show that these are distinct actin assembly mechanisms in the acute phase after treatment (<10 min). Calcium-induced actin assembly is INF2-dependent and Arp2/3 complex-independent, whereas depolarization-induced actin assembly is Arp2/3 complex-dependent and INF2-independent. The two types of actin polymerization are morphologically distinct, with calcium-induced filaments throughout the cytosol and depolarization-induced filaments as \\\"clouds\\\" around depolarized mitochondria. We have previously shown that calcium-induced actin stimulates increases in both mitochondrial calcium and recruitment of the dynamin GTPase Drp1. In contrast, depolarization-induced actin is temporally-associated with extensive mitochondrial dynamics that do not result in mitochondrial fission, but in circularization of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). These dynamics are dependent upon the protease Oma1 and independent of Drp1. Actin cloud inhibition causes increased IMM circularization, suggesting that actin clouds limit these dynamics.\\n\\nSummary statementMitochondrial depolarization induces Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin clouds that restrain mitochondrial shape changes induced by Oma1 on the inner mitochondrial membrane. A distinct actin network stimulates mitochondrial fission in response to calcium.",

    "abstract": "During phenylalanine catabolism, phenylacetic acid (PAA) is converted to phenylacetyl-CoA (PAA-CoA) by a ligase, PaaK, and then epoxidized by a multicomponent monooxygenase, PaaABCDE, before further degradation to the TCA cycle. In the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia, loss of paaABCDE attenuates virulence factor expression, which is under control of the LuxIR-like quorum sensing system, CepIR. To further investigate the link between CepIR-regulated virulence and PAA catabolism, we created knockout mutants of the first step of the pathway (PAA-CoA synthesis by PaaK) and characterized them in comparison to a paaABCDE mutant using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and virulence assays. We found that while loss of PaaABCDE decreased virulence, deletion of the paaK genes resulted in a more virulent phenotype than the wild type strain. Deletion of either paaK or paaABCDE led to higher levels of released PAA but no differences in internal accumulation, compared to wild type. While we found no evidence of direct cepIR downregulation by PAA-CoA or PAA, a low virulence cepR mutant reverted to a virulent phenotype upon removal of the paaK genes. On the other hand, removal of paaABCDE in the cepR mutant did not impact its attenuated phenotype. Together, our results suggest an indirect role for PAA-CoA in supressing B. cenocepacia CepIR-activated virulence.\\n\\nImportanceThe opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia uses a chemical signal process called quorum sensing (QS) to produce virulence factors. In B. cenocepacia, QS relies on the presence of the transcriptional regulator CepR, which upon binding QS signal molecules, activates virulence. In this work, we found that even in the absence of CepR, B. cenocepacia can elicit a pathogenic response if phenylacetyl-CoA, an intermediate of the phenylacetic acid degradation pathway, is not produced. Instead, accumulation of phenylacetyl-CoA appears to attenuate pathogenicity. Therefore, we have discovered that it is possible to trigger virulence in the absence of CepR, challenging the classical view of activation of virulence by this QS mechanism. Our work provides new insight into the relationship between metabolism and virulence in opportunistic bacteria. We propose that, in the event that QS signaling molecules cannot accumulate to trigger a pathogenic response, a metabolic signal can still activate virulence in B. cenocepacia.",

AP2 dwells in a closed, inactive state in the cytosol, but adopts an open, active conformation on the plasma membrane. Membrane-activated complexes are also phosphorylated, but the significance of this mark is debated. We recently proposed that NECAP negatively regulates AP2 by binding open and phosphorylated complexes (Beacham et al., 2018). Here, we report high-resolution cryo-EM structures of NECAP bound to phosphorylated AP2. The site of AP2 phosphorylation is directly coordinated by residues of the NECAP PHear domain that are predicted from genetic screens in C. elegans. Using membrane mimetics to generate conformationally open AP2, we find that a second domain of NECAP binds these complexes and cryo-EM reveals both domains of NECAP engaging closed, inactive AP2. Assays in vitro and in vivo confirm these domains cooperate to inactivate AP2. We propose that phosphorylation marks adaptors for inactivation.",

    "abstract": "To understand how extracellular polymer substances (EPS) as additives promotes methanogenesis, batch tests of methane production potential in anaerobic reactors with the addition of EPS or not were conducted. Research showed that EPS increased remarkably methane production during anaerobic digestion (36.5% increase compared with the control). EPS enriched functional microorganisms such as Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Synergistetes, and Chloroflexi. Among them, 8.86% OTUs from the important hydrolysis and acidification phyla, which may be an important reason for the enhanced methanogenic capacity of anaerobic granular sludge. Additionally, EPS also improved the abundance of cytochrome c (c-Cyts), accelerating the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens, thus enhancing the methane production. Interestingly, the average particle size, volatile suspended solids/total suspended solids (VSS/TSS) and EPS content of anaerobic granular sludge (AnGS) in the EPS reactor were approximately equal to that of the control reactor during the anaerobic digestion, illustrating that EPS could not affect the physicochemical properties of AnGS. Therefore, these results suggested that EPS mainly played a role in the form of conductive materials in the anaerobic digestion process. Compared with conductive materials, EPS as biomass conductive materials was not only environmentally friendly and economical but also no secondary pollution.\\n\\nImportanceCompared with the reported conductive materials, EPS has the potential of biodegradation, electron transfer and no significant secondary pollution. Besides, there are few studies on the utilization of EPS resources, especially the effect of EPS as an additive on anaerobic digestion performance.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the influence of EPS as an additive on the methanogenic capacity, physical-chemical properties, microbial community structure and metabolic function of anaerobic granular sludge (AnGS), and preliminarily expatiate the influence mechanism of EPS as an additive on methanogenesis.

It has been suggested that non-use is a consequence of the greater effort and/or attention required to use the affected limb, but such accounts have not been tested, and we have poor understanding of the characteristics of individuals who exhibit non-use.\\n\\nObjectiveWe aimed to provide preliminary evidence regarding the demographic, neuropsychological, and psychological factors that may influence non-use in chronic stroke.\\n\\nMethodsTwenty chronic stroke survivors (10 left and 10 right hemisphere stroke) with mild-to-moderate sensory-motor impairment on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) were assessed with the Actual Amount of Use Test (AAUT), which measures the disparity between amount of use and quality of movement in \\\"spontaneous\\\" versus \\\"forced\\\" conditions. Participants were als assessed with measures of limb apraxia, spatial neglect, attention/arousal, and self-efficacy (confidence in arm movement). Using stepwise multiple regression, we determined whether demographic information and/or performance on these measures predicted AAUT non-use scores.\\n\\nResultsScores on the UEFM as well as attention/arousal and self-efficacy predicted the degree of non-use. Attention/arousal predicted non-use above and beyond UEFM.\\n\\nConclusionsGiven the complexity of the non-use phenomenon, it follows that a combination of impairment, attention/arousal, and perceived confidence predicted non-use behavior. That a measure of attention/arousal predicted non-use behavior above and beyond sensory-motor functioning highlights the importance of motivated engagement to drive use of the paretic limb. Larger-scale studies incorporating additional measures (e.g., mental health, lesion volume and white matter connectivity, pain, motivation) will be important for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "The shikimate pathway, a metabolic pathway absent in humans, is responsible for the production of chorismate, a branch point metabolite. In the malaria parasite, chorismate is postulated to be a direct precursor in the synthesis of p-aminobenzoic acid (folate biosynthesis), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (ubiquinone biosynthesis), menaquinone, and aromatic amino acids. While the potential value of the shikimate pathway as a drug target is debatable, the metabolic dependency of chorismate in P. falciparum remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that the main role of chorismate is folate biosynthesis despite ubiquinone biosynthesis being active and essential in the malaria parasite. Our goal in the present work was to expand our knowledge of the ubiquinone head group biosynthesis and its potential metabolic dependency on chorismate in P. falciparum. These data led us to further characterize the mechanism of action of MMV688345, a compound from the open-access \\\"Pathogen Box\\\" collection from Medicine for Malaria Venture. We systematically assessed the development of both asexual and sexual stages of P. falciparum in a defined medium in the absence of an exogenous supply of chorismate end-products and present biochemical evidence suggesting that the benzoquinone ring of ubiquinones in this parasite may be synthesized through a yet unidentified route.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of novel spatial transcriptomic and proteomic technologies has provided new opportunities to investigate the interactions between cells and their native microenvironment. However, effective use of such technologies requires the development of innovative computational tools that are easily accessible and intuitive to use. Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive, flexible, robust, and open-source toolbox for spatial transcriptomic and proteomic data analysis and visualization. The data analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for characterizing cell-type distribution, spatially coherent gene expression patterns, and interactions between each cell and its surrounding neighbors. Furthermore, Giotto can also be used in conjunction with external single-cell RNAseq data to infer the spatial enrichment of cell types from data that do not have single-cell resolution. The data visualization module allows users to interactively visualize the gene expression data, analysis outputs, and additional imaging features, thereby providing a user-friendly workspace to explore multiple modalities of information for biological investigation. These two modules can be used iteratively for refined analysis and hypothesis development. We applied Giotto to a wide range of public datasets encompassing diverse technologies and platforms, thereby demonstrating its general applicability for spatial transcriptomic and proteomic data analysis and visualization.",

We examined multiple self-reported measures of race and ancestry from a cohort of over 100,000 U.S. residents alongside genetic data. We found that these measures are often non-overlapping, and that no single self-reported measure alone provides a better fit to genetic ancestry than a combination including both race and geographic ancestry. We also found that patterns of reporting for race and ancestry appear to be influenced by participation in direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry testing.

    "abstract": "RNA viruses form a dynamic distribution of mutant swarm (termed \\\"quasispecies\\\") due to the accumulation of mutations in the viral genome. The genetic diversity of a viral population is affected by several factors, including a bottleneck effect. Human-to-human transmission ex-emplifies a bottleneck effect in that only part of a viral population can reach the next susceptible hosts. In the present study, the rhesus rotavirus (RRV) strain of Rotavirus A was serially passaged five times at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or 0.001 in duplicate (the 1st and 2nd lineages), and three phenotypes (infectious titer, cell binding ability and specific growth rate) were used to evaluate the impact of a bottleneck effect on the RRV population. The specific growth rate values of lineages passaged under the stronger bottleneck (MOI of 0.001) were higher after five passages. The nucleotide diversity also increased, which indicated that the mutant swarms of the lineages under the stronger bottleneck effect were expanded through the serial passages. The random distribution of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions on rotaviral genome segments indicated that almost all mutations were selectively neutral. Simple simulations revealed that the presence of minor mutants could influence the specific growth rate of a population in a mutant frequency-dependent manner. These results indicate that a stronger bottleneck effect can create more sequence spaces for minor mutants originally existing in a hidden layer of mutant swarm.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we investigated a bottleneck effect on an RRV population, which may drastically impact a viral population structure. RRV populations were serially passaged under two levels of a bottleneck effect, which exemplified a human-to-human transmission. As a result, the genetic diversity and specific growth rate of RRV populations increased under the stronger bottleneck effect, which implied that a bottleneck could create a new sequence space in a population for minor mutants originally existing in a hidden layer of a mutant swarm of the double-stranded RNA virus. The results of this study suggest that the genetic drift caused by a bottleneck in a human-to-human transmission explains the random appearance of new genetic lineages causing viral outbreaks, which can be expected by the molecular epidemiology using next generation sequencing in which the viral genetic diversity within a viral population is investigated.",

We had two non-human primate (NHP) subjects (one male bonnet macaque and one female rhesus macaque) make visually cued grip-force movements while simultaneously cueing the level of possible reward if successful, or timeout punishment, if unsuccessful. We recorded simultaneously from 96 electrodes in each the following: caudal somatosensory, rostral motor, and dorsal premotor cortices (cS1, rM1, PMd). We utilized several normalization models for valence and motivational intensity in all three regions. We found three types of divisive normalized relationships between neural activity and the representation of valence and motivation, linear, sigmodal, and hyperbolic. The hyperbolic relationships resemble receptive fields in psychological affect space, where a unit is susceptible to a small range of the valence/motivational space. We found that these cortical regions have both strong valence and motivational intensity representations.",

Recently, tau has been found to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) near physiological conditions. Although LLPS and aggregation have been shown to simultaneously occur under certain common conditions, it remains to be seen whether tau LLPS promotes aggregation, or if they are two independent processes. In this study, we address this question by combining multiple biochemical and biophysical assays in vitro. We investigated the impacts of LLPS on tau aggregation at three stages: conformation of tau, kinetics of aggregation and fibril quantity. We showed that none of these properties are influenced directly by LLPS, while amyloid aggregation propensity of tau can be altered without affecting its LLPS behavior. LLPS and amyloid aggregation of tau occur under overlapping conditions of enhanced intermolecular interactions and localization, but are two independent processes.",

Our objectives were to 1) determine if introgressing specific chromosome segments (instead of quantitative trait locus alleles) from exotic soybean germplasm has potential for improving an elite cultivar, and 2) identify strategies to introgress and pyramid exotic chromosome segments into an elite cultivar. We estimated genomewide marker effects for yield and other traits in seven crosses between the elite line IA3023 and seven soybean plant introductions (PIs). We then predicted genetic gains from having [&le;]2 targeted recombinations per linkage group. When introgression was modeled for yield while controlling maturity in the seven PI x IA3023 populations, the predicted yield was 8 to 25% over the yield of IA3023. Correlated changes in maturity, seed traits, lodging, and plant height were generally small but were in the favorable direction. In contrast, selecting the best recombinant inbred (without targeted recombination) in each of the PI x IA3023 populations led to negative or minimal yield gains over IA3023. In one PI x IA3023 population, introgressing and pyramiding only two linkage groups from recombinant inbreds into IA3023 was predicted to achieve an 8% yield gain over IA3023 without sacrificing the performance of other traits. The probability of inheriting intact chromosomes was high enough to allow introgression and pyramiding of chromosome segments in 5-6 generations. Overall, our study suggested that introgressing specific chromosome segments is an effective way to introduce exotic soybean germplasm into an elite cultivar.\\n\\nKey messageTo improve an elite soybean line, introgress longer chromosome segments instead of QTL alleles from exotic germplasm.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic association studies of schizophrenia may be confounded by the pathological heterogeneity and multifactorial nature of this disease. We demonstrated previously that combinations of the three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs10770141 of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene, rs4680 of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, and rs1800497 of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene may be associated with schizophrenia onset, and we tested those associations herein. Methods: We conducted a secondary study of 2,542 individuals in age- and sex-matched case-control populations. The schizophrenia diagnosis was based on the DSM-IV. To reduce the influence of confounders (age and sex), we performed a propensity score matching analysis. Genotyping and associative analyses of rs10770141, rs4680, and rs1800497 with schizophrenia were performed. Results: We analyzed 1,271 schizophrenics (male/female: 574/698; age 47.4{+/-}13.9 years) and 1,271 matched controls (male/female: 603/669; age 46.5{+/-}13.4 years). The estimated odds ratios (ORs) were 1.245 (p<0.001) for rs4680, 1.727 (p<0.0001) for rs1800497, and 1.788 (p<0.0001) for rs10770141. Double SNP analyses revealed the ORs of 2.010 (p<0.0001) for the combination of rs4680*rs1800497, 1.871 (p<0.001) for rs1800497*rs10770141, and 1.428 (p=0.068) for rs4680*rs1800497. Among the individuals with any of the three double SNP risk combinations (which accounted for 35.8% of the involved patients), the estimated OR was 2.224 (p<0.0001). Conclusions: In this validation study, the combinations of functional polymorphisms related to dopaminergic genes were associated with the development of schizophrenia. Analyzing combinations of functional polymorphisms with the control of possible confounders may provide new insights for association research.",

In this study, we used a genetic screening approach to identify insulin-like receptor as a novel component of the immune response to arboviral infection. We determined that vertebrate insulin reduces West Nile virus (WNV) replication in Drosophila melanogaster as well as WNV, Zika, and dengue virus titers in mosquito cells. Mechanistically, we showed that insulin signaling activates the JAK/STAT, but not RNAi, pathway to control infection. Finally, we validated that insulin priming of adult female Culex mosquitoes through a blood meal reduces WNV infection, demonstrating an essential role for insulin signaling in insect antiviral responses to emerging human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "HIV drug resistance continues to demand for alternative drug targets. Since Reverse Transcriptase (RT) is unique and critical for the virus life cycle, it is a rational target that is likely to have less off-target effects in humans. Serendipitously, we found two chemical compound scaffolds from the NCI Diversity Set V that inhibited the HIV1- RT catalytic activity. Computational structural analyses and subsequent experimental testing demonstrated that one of the two chemical scaffolds binds to a novel location in the HIV-1 RT p51 subunit, interacting with residue Y183 that has no known association with previously reported drug resistance. This finding leads to the notion of a novel druggable site on p51 for a new class of non-nucleoside RT Inhibitors that may inhibit HIV-1 RT allosterically. Although inhibitory activity was shown experimentally only to be in the hundreds micromolar range, the scaffolds serve as a proof-of-concept of targeting HIV RT p51, with the possibility for medical chemistry methods to be applied to improve the inhibitory activity, towards a functioning drug.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional single-cell cytometry is routinely used to characterize patient responses to cancer immunotherapy and other treatments. This has produced a wealth of datasets ripe for exploration but whose biological and technical heterogeneity make them difficult to analyze with current tools. We introduce a new interpretable machine learning method for single-cell mass and flow cytometry studies, FAUST, that robustly performs unbiased cell population discovery and annotation. FAUST processes data on a per-sample basis and returns biologically interpretable cell phenotypes that can be compared across studies, making it well-suited for the analysis and integration of complex datasets. We demonstrate how FAUST can be used for candidate biomarker discovery and validation by applying it to a flow cytometry dataset from a Merkel cell carcinoma anti-PD-1 trial and discover new CD4+ and CD8+ effector-memory T cell correlates of outcome co-expressing PD-1, HLA-DR, and CD28. We then use FAUST to validate these correlates in an independent CyTOF dataset from a published metastatic melanoma trial. Importantly, existing state-of-the-art computational discovery approaches as well as prior manual analysis did not detect these or any other statistically significant T cell sub-populations associated with anti-PD-1 treatment in either data set. We further validate our methodology by using FAUST to replicate the discovery of a previously reported myeloid correlate in a different published melanoma trial, and validate the correlate by identifying it de novo in two additional independent trials. FAUSTs phenotypic annotations can be used to perform cross-study data integration in the presence of heterogeneous data and diverse immunophenotyping staining panels, enabling hypothesis-driven inference about cell sub-population abundance through a multivariate modeling framework we call Phenotypic and Functional Differential Abundance (PFDA). We demonstrate this approach on data from myeloid and T cell panels across multiple trials. Together, these results establish FAUST as a powerful and versatile new approach for unbiased discovery in single-cell cytometry.",

When dsRNA is expressed or introduced into one cell and is transported to and initiates RNAi in other cells, it is called systemic RNAi. Systemic RNAi is very efficient in C. elegans and genetic screens for systemic RNAi defective (Sid) mutants have identified RNA transporters (SID-1, SID-2 and SID-5) and a signaling protein (SID-3). Here we report that SID-4 is nck-1, a C. elegans NCK-like adaptor protein. sid-4 null mutations cause a weak, dosesensitive, systemic RNAi defect and can be effectively rescued by SID-4 expression in target tissues only, implying a role in dsRNA import. SID-4 and SID-3 (ACK-1 kinase) homologs interact in mammals and insects, suggesting they may function in a common signaling pathway, however, a sid-3; sid-4 double mutants showed additive resistance to RNAi, suggesting that these proteins likely interact with other signaling pathways as well. A bioinformatic screen coupled to RNAi sensitivity tests identified 23 additional signaling components with weak RNAi defective phenotypes. These observations suggest that environmental conditions may modulate systemic RNAi efficacy, and indeed, sid-3 and sid-4 are required for growth temperature effects on systemic RNAi silencing efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In the classical view of economic choices, subjects make rational decisions evaluating the costs and benefits of options in order to maximize their overall income. Nonetheless, subjects often fail to reach optimal outcomes. The overt value of an option drives the direction of decisions, but covert factors such as emotion and sunk cost are thought to drive the observed deviations from optimality. Many questions remain to be answered as to 1) which contexts contribute the most to deviation from an optimal solution; and 2) the extent of these effects. In order to tackle these questions, we devised a decision-making task for mice, in which cost and benefit parameters could be independently and flexibly adjusted and for which a tractable optimal solution was known. Comparing mouse behavior with this optimal solution across parameter settings revealed that the factor most strongly contributing to suboptimality was the cost parameter. The quantification of sunk cost, a covert factor implicated in our task design, revealed it as another contributor to suboptimality. In one condition where the large reward option was particularly unattractive and the small reward cost was low, the sunk cost effect and the cost-led suboptimality almost vanished. In this regime and this regime only, mice could be viewed as close to rational. Taken together, our findings support a model whereby parallel neural circuits independently activate and modulate multiple valuation algorithms, and suggest that \"rationality\" is a task-specific construct even in mice.\n\nSignificant StatementIrrational factors in economic decision-making often cause significant deviation from optimal outcomes. By devising a flexible economic choice behavior for mice and comparing their behavior with an optimal solution, we investigated overt and covert factors that contributed to suboptimal outcomes and quantified the deviation from optimality. This investigation identified regimes where mice could be viewed as rational or irrational depending upon the parameters in the same task. These findings may provide a platform to investigate biological substrates underlying rational and irrational decision factors.",

    "abstract": "Egg laying in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a two-state behavior modulated by internal and external sensory input. We have previously shown that homeostatic feedback of embryo accumulation in the uterus regulates bursting activity of the serotonergic HSN command neurons that sustains the egg-laying active state. How sensory feedback of egg release signals to terminate the egg-laying active state is less understood. We find that Go, a conserved Pertussis Toxin-sensitive G protein, signals within HSN to inhibit egg-laying circuit activity and prevent entry into the active state. Go signaling hyperpolarizes HSN, reducing HSN Ca2+ activity and input onto the postsynaptic vulval muscles. Loss of inhibitory Go signaling uncouples presynaptic HSN activity from a postsynaptic, stretch-dependent homeostat, causing precocious entry into the egg-laying active state when only a few eggs are present in the uterus. Feedback of vulval opening and egg release activates the uv1 neuroendocrine cells which release NLP-7 neuropeptides which signal to inhibit egg laying through Go-independent mechanisms in the HSNs and Go-dependent mechanisms in cells other than the HSNs. Thus, neuropeptide and inhibitory Go signaling maintains a bi-stable state of electrical excitability that dynamically controls circuit activity in response to both external and internal sensory input to drive a two-state behavior output.",

    "abstract": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) transfers triglycerides and phospholipids and is essential for the assembly of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We have discovered a zebrafish mutant (mttpc655) expressing a C-terminal missense mutation (G863V) in Mttp, one of the two subunits of MTP, that is defective at transferring triglycerides, but retains phospholipid transfer activity. Mutagenesis of the conserved glycine in the human MTTP protein (G865V) also eliminates triglyceride but not phospholipid transfer activity. The G863V mutation reduces the production and size of ApoB-containing lipoproteins in zebrafish embryos and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the yolk syncytial layer. However, mttpc655 mutants exhibit only mild intestinal lipid malabsorption and normal growth as adults. In contrast, zebrafish mutants bearing the previously identified mttpstl mutation (L475P) are deficient in transferring both triglycerides and phospholipids and exhibit gross intestinal lipid accumulation and defective growth. Thus, the G863V point mutation provides the first evidence that the triglyceride and phospholipid transfer functions of a vertebrate MTP protein can be separated, arguing that selective inhibition of the triglyceride transfer activity of MTP may be a feasible therapeutic approach for dyslipidemia.",

    "abstract": "Object memories activated by borders serve as priors for figure assignment: figures are more likely to be perceived on the side of a border where a well-known object is sketched. Do object memories also affect the appearance of object borders? Memories represent past experience with objects; memories of well-known objects include many with sharp borders because they are often fixated. We investigated whether object memories affect appearance by testing whether blurry borders appear sharper when they are contours of well-known objects versus matched novel objects. Participants viewed blurry versions of one familiar and one novel stimulus simultaneously for 180ms; then made comparative (Exp. 1) or equality judgments regarding perceived blur (Exps. 2-4). For equivalent levels of blur, the borders of well-known objects appeared sharper than those of novel objects. These results extend evidence for the influence of past experience to object appearance, consistent with dynamic interactive models of perception.",

    "abstract": "Interactions within a population shape the spread of infectious diseases but contact patterns between individuals are difficult to access. We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing the concept of infection barcodes. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, infection barcode summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining infection barcodes for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection). The combination of individual-based simulations and barcode analysis of infection histories opens promising perspectives to infer and validate transmission networks and immunological interference for infectious diseases from longitudinal cohort data.\n\nAuthor summaryInfectious disease dynamics are constrained both by between-host contacts and pathogen interactions within a host. Furthermore, multiple parasites circulate such that hosts are infected (sometimes simultaneously) by a variety of strains or species. We hypothesise that multiple infection history can inform us about the networks on which parasites are transmitted, but also on within-host interactions such as immunological interference. We developed a simulator for multiple infections on networks. By combining intuitive novel metrics for multiple infection events and established tools from computational data analysis, we show that similarity in infection history between two hosts correlates with their proximity in the contact network. By analysing pathogens co-occurrence patterns within hosts, we also recover immunological interference at the population level. The demonstrated robustness of our results in terms of observability, network clustering, and pathogen diversity opens new perspectives to extract host contact and between-pathogen immunity information from longitudinal cohort data.",

    "abstract": "Spore forming bacteria of the orders Bacillales and Clostridiales play a major role in food spoilage and food-borne diseases. The spores remain in a dormant state for extended periods due to their highly resistant features. When environmental conditions become favourable, they can germinate as the germinant receptors located on the spores inner membrane get activated via germinant binding. This leads to the formation of vegetative cells via germination and subsequent outgrowth. The present study focuses on the synthesis of protein MalS during B. subtilis spore germination by investigating the dynamics of the fluorescence level of a MalS-GFP fusion protein using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Our results show an initial increase within the first 15 minutes of germination, followed by a drop and stabilization of the fluorescence throughout the spore ripening period. Western blot analyses, however, indicate no increase in the levels of the MalS-GFP fusion protein during the first 15 minutes after the addition of the germinants. Thus the instantaneous increase in fluorescence of MalS-GFP may likely due to a change in the physical environment as the spore germination is triggered. Our findings also show that the different sporulation conditions and the maturation time of spores affect the expression of MalS-GFP and the germination behaviour of the spores.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic interneurons are proposed to be critical for early activity and synapse formation by directly exciting, rather than inhibiting, neurons in developing hippocampus and neocortex. However, the role of GABAergic neurons in the generation of neonatal network activity has not been tested in vivo, and recent studies have challenged the excitatory nature of early GABA. By locally manipulating interneuron activity in unanesthetized neonatal mice, we show that GABAergic neurons are indeed excitatory in hippocampus at postnatal-day 3 (P3), and responsible for most of the spontaneous firing of pyramidal cells at that age. Hippocampal interneurons become inhibitory by P7, whereas cortical interneurons are inhibitory at P3 and remain so throughout development. This regional and age heterogeneity is the result of a change in chloride reversal potential as activation of light-gated anion channels expressed in glutamatergic neurons causes firing in hippocampus at P3, but silences it at P7. This study in the intact brain reveals a critical role for GABAergic interneuron excitation in neonatal hippocampus, and a surprising heterogeneity of interneuron function in cortical circuits that was not predicted from in vitro studies.",

    "abstract": "We have characterized the structural determinants of phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) self-association using site-directed mutagenesis, SDS-PAGE, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. PLB and SLN are single-pass transmembrane (TM) peptides that are critically involved in regulation of contractility in cardiac and skeletal muscle via reversible inhibition of calcium (Ca) transport by SERCA. PLB and SLN also exhibit ion channel activity in vitro, yet the physiological significance of these functions is unknown. Here we have determined that structural insights offered by the tetrameric PLB Cys41 to Leu (C41L) mutation, a mutant with four possible leucine/isoleucine zipper interactions for stabilizing PLB tetramers. Using scanning alanine mutagenesis and SDS-PAGE, we have determined the C41L-PLB tetramer is destabilized by mutation of Leu37 to Ala (L37A) or Ile40 to Ala (I40A), which are the same a- and d-arm residues stabilizing the PLB pentamer via leucine/isoleucine zippers, highlighting the importance of these two zippers in PLB higher-order oligomerization. The new possible zipper arm in C41L-PLB (N34, C41L, I48) did not contribute to tetramerization. On the other hand, we determined that tetramer conversion back to pentamer was induced by alanine mutation of Ile48, a residue located on the e-arm below C41L, implicating steric interaction and restriction are the stabilizing and destabilizing forces that control the distribution between pentamer and tetramer populations. We propose that the e-arm and hydrophobic residues in the adjacent b-arm act as secondary structural motifs that help control the stoichiometry of PLB oligomerization. FRET microscopy and alanine mutagenesis of SLN residues Val14 (V14A) or Leu21 (L21A) decreased the binding affinity of the SLN-SLN complex, demonstrating the importance of each residue in mediating self-association. Helical wheel analysis supports a heptad-repeat TM zipper mechanism of SLN oligomerization, similar to the 3.5 residue/turn Leu and Ile zippers found in PLB pentamers. Collectively, our studies add new insights on the conservation of homologous hydrophobic 3-4 pattern of residues in zipper motifs that mediate PLB and SLN self-assembly. We propose that the importance of these apolar, steric interactions in the TM domain are widespread in stabilizing higher-order oligomerization of membrane proteins.",

TDF/FTC induced type I/III interferon-related (IFN I/III) genes in the gastrointestinal tract, but not blood, with strong correlations between the two independent rectal biopsy groups (Spearman r=0.91) and between the rectum and duodenum (r=0.81).

    "abstract": "A substantial fraction of eukaryotic proteins is folded and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to export and secretion. Proteins that enter the ER but fail to fold correctly must be degraded, mostly in a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Both protein folding in the ER and ERAD are essential for proper immune function. Several E2 and E3 enzymes localize to the ER and are essential for various aspects of ERAD, but their functions and regulation are incompletely understood. Here we identify and characterize single domain antibody fragments derived from the variable domain of alpaca heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs or nanobodies) that bind to the ER-localized E2 UBC6e, an enzyme implicated in ERAD. One such VHH, VHH05 recognizes a 14 residue stretch and enhances the rate of E1-catalyzed ubiquitin E2 loading in vitro and interferes with phosphorylation of UBC6e in response to cell stress. Identification of the peptide epitope recognized by VHH05 places it outside the E2 catalytic core, close to the position of activation-induced phosphorylation on Ser184. Our data thus suggests a site involved in allosteric regulation of UBC6es activity. This VHH should be useful not only to dissect the participation of UBC6e in ERAD and in response to cell stress, but also as a high affinity epitope tag-specific reagent of more general utility.\\n\\nHighlights- Identified single domain antibodies (VHHs) that bind to UBC6e with high affinity\\n- VHH binds to a short linear epitope near a phosphorylation site\\n- VHH binding to UBC6e enhances enzymatic activity\\n- VHH binding inhibits UBC6e phosphorylation in cells",

Recent genetic correlational studies have implicated DNA damage repair pathways in modifying the age at onset of disease symptoms in SCA1 and Huntingtons Disease, another polyglutamine expansion disease. We demonstrate that both endogenous and transfected ataxin-1 localizes to sites of DNA damage, which is impaired by polyglutamine expansion. This response is dependent on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Further, we characterize an ATM phosphorylation motif within ataxin-1 at serine 188. We show reduction of the Drosophila ATM homolog levels in a ATXN1[82Q] Drosophila model through shRNA or genetic cross ameliorates motor symptoms. These findings offer a possible explanation as to why DNA repair was implicated in SCA1 pathogenesis by past studies.

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization is a central theme in biology. Cells are composed of numerous membrane-enclosed structures, evolved to facilitate specific biochemical processes; viruses act as containers of genetic material, optimized to drive infection. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a mechanism to study biomolecular containers and the influence they exert on their environments; however, trajectory analysis software generally lacks knowledge of container interior versus exterior. Further, many relevant container analyses involve large-scale particle tracking endeavors, which may become computationally prohibitive with increasing system size. Here, a novel method based on 3-D ray casting is presented, which rapidly classifies the space surrounding biomolecular containers of arbitrary shape, enabling fast determination of the identities and counts of particles (e.g., solvent molecules) found inside and outside. The method is broadly applicable to the study of containers and enables high-performance characterization of properties such as solvent density, small-molecule transport, transbilayer lipid diffusion, and topology of protein cavities. The method is implemented in VMD, a widely used simulation analysis tool that supports personal computers, clouds, and parallel supercomputers, including ORNLs Summit and Titan and NCSAs Blue Waters, where the method can be employed to efficiently analyze trajectories encompassing millions of particles. The ability to rapidly characterize the spatial relationships of particles relative to a biomolecular container over many trajectory frames, irrespective of large particle counts, enables analysis of containers on a scale that was previously unfeasible, at a level of accuracy that was previously unattainable.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe cell is the basic unit of life. Within the container of the cell, the many chemical reactions and biological processes essential to life are carried out simultaneously. Human and other eukaryotic cells include a variety of sub-containers, namely organelles, that provide separation between reactions and processes, and engender the chemical environments conducive to them. In order to understand how the cell works, researchers must study the functions of these containers. Molecular dynamics simulations can reveal important information about how biomolecular containers behave and control their enclosed environments, but the latter can be particularly challenging and expensive to measure. The challenge arises because simulation analysis software lacks awareness of the concepts of container \\\"inside\\\" and \\\"outside.\\\" The expense arises because tracking the many solvent molecules that make up a containers environment requires significant computing power. We have developed a method that allows the simulation analysis software VMD to automatically detect the interior versus exterior of a container and quickly identify the solvent molecules found in each location. This versatile new feature enables researchers to characterize essential container properties using a relatively inexpensive calculation. Further, the method performs efficiently on supercomputers, allowing researchers to study massive container systems that include millions of particles.",

Meanwhile, mouse nongrowing oocytes and sperm- or oocyte-originated haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) carrying both H19 and IG-DMR (differentially DNA-methylated region) deletions (DKO) that partially mimic paternal imprinting of H19-Igf2 and Dlk1-Dio3 can be employed as sperm replacement to efficiently support full-term embryonic development. However, how H19-DMR and IG-DMR act together to regulate embryonic development is still largely unknown.

H19-DMR plays critical roles before 12.5 days of gestation while IG-DMR is essential for late-gestation of SC embryos.

Transcriptome and histology analyses revealed that H19 and H19-DMR combined deletions rescue the placental defects.

Based on log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, articles with a preprint had a 51% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 37% more citations compared to articles without one. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (e.g., scientific subfield and last author publication age) and unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor.

    "abstract": "Glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) is the catalytic subunit for the glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) enzyme. Gcl catalyzes the rate limiting step in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Gclc is highly expressed in the developing eye. To define the regulatory role of Gclc in eye development, we developed a novel, Le-Cre transgene-driven, Gclc knockout mouse model. Gclcf/f/Le-CreTg/- mice present with deformation of the retina, cornea, iris, and lens, consistent with a microphthalmia phenotype. Controlling for the microphthalmia phenotype of Gclcwt/wt/Le-CreTg/- mice revealed that Gclcf/f/Le-CreTg/- mice have a more severe microphthalmia phenotype. Thus, the loss of Gclc expression exacerbates the microphthalmia phenotype in Le-Cre mice. Gclcf/f/Le-CreTg/- eyes present with reduced retinal and lens epithelium proliferation and increased lens cell death. Imaging mass spectrometry of ocular tissues revealed changes in the intensity and distribution of several lipid species and proteins in the retina and corneas of Gclcf/f/Le-CreTg/- eyes. Lastly, using splice-blocking morpholinos and CRISPR/Cas9, we created two gclc knockdown zebrafish models, both of which display a microphthalmia phenotype. Combined, the mouse and zebrafish results indicate that, in chordates, Gclc has a conserved role in regulating eye development. In summary, these novel animal models are useful tools for elucidating the mechanisms involved in microphthalmia development.",

    "abstract": "Flagellin is the major constituent of the flagellar filament and faithful restoration of wild-type motility to flagellin mutants may be beneficial for studies of flagellar biology and biotechnological exploitation of the flagellar system. Therefore, we explored the restoration of motility by flagellin expressed from a variety of combinations of promoter, plasmid copy number and induction strength. Motility was only partially restored using the tightly regulated rhamnose promoter, but wild-type motility was achieved with the T5 promoter, which, although leaky, allowed titration of induction strength. Motility was little affected by plasmid copy number when dependent on inducible promoters. However, plasmid copy number was important when expression was controlled by the native E. coli flagellin promoter. Motility was poorly correlated with flagellin transcription levels, but strongly correlated with the amount of flagellin associated with the flagellar filament, suggesting that excess monomers are either not exported or not assembled into filaments. This study provides a useful reference for further studies of flagellar function and a simple blueprint for similar studies with other proteins.",

    "abstract": "We have analyzed gene transcription, protein expression, and enzymatic activity of the Ca2+-transporting ATPase (SERCA) in horse gluteal muscle. Horses are bred for peak athletic performance but exhibit a high incidence of exertional rhabdomyolysis, with myosolic Ca2+ suggested as a correlative linkage. To assess Ca2+ regulation in horse gluteus, we developed an improved protocol for isolating horse sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. RNA-seq and immunoblotting determined that the ATP2A1 gene (protein product SERCA1) is the predominant Ca2+-ATPase expressed in horse gluteus, as in rabbit muscle. Gene expression was assessed for four regulatory peptides of SERCA, finding that sarcolipin (SLN) is the predominant regulatory peptide transcript expressed in horse gluteus, as in rabbit muscle. Surprisingly, the RNA transcription ratio of SLN-to-ATP2A1 in horse gluteus is an order of magnitude higher than in rabbit muscle, but conversely, the protein expression ratio of SLN-to-SERCA1 in horse gluteus is an order of magnitude lower than in rabbit. Thus, the SLN gene is not translated to a stable protein in horse gluteus, yet the supra-high level of SLN RNA suggests a non-coding role. Gel-stain analysis revealed that horse SR expresses calsequestrin (CASQ) protein abundantly, with a CASQ-to-SERCA ratio [~]3-fold greater than rabbit SR. The Ca2+ transport rate of horse SR vesicles is [~]2-fold greater than rabbit SR, suggesting horse myocytes have enhanced luminal Ca2+ stores that increase intracellular Ca2+ release and muscular performance. The absence of SLN inhibition of SERCA and the abundant expression of CASQ may potentiate horse muscle contractility and susceptibility to exertional rhabdomyolysis.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of embryological development has long been characterized by deep conservation. Both morphological and transcriptomic surveys have proposed a \\\"hourglass\\\" model of Evo-Devo1,2. A stage in mid-embryonic development, the phylotypic stage, is highly conserved among species within the same phylum3-7. However, the reason for this phylotypic stage is still elusive. Here we hypothesize that the phylotypic stage might be characterized by selection for robustness to noise and environmental perturbations. This could lead to mutational robustness, thus evolutionary conservation of expression and the hourglass pattern. To test this, we quantified expression variability of single embryo transcriptomes throughout fly Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. We found that indeed expression variability is lower at extended germband, the phylotypic stage. We explain this pattern by stronger histone modification mediated transcriptional noise control at this stage. In addition, we find evidence that histone modifications can also contribute to mutational robustness in regulatory elements. Thus, the robustness to noise does indeed contributes to robustness of gene expression to genetic variations, and to the conserved phylotypic stage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, a bioinformatics method for interpreting GWAS data using metabolic pathway analysis has been developed and successfully used to find significant pathways and mechanisms explaining phenotypic traits of interest in plants. However, the many scripts implementing this method were not straightforward to use, had to be customized for each project, required user supervision, and took more than 24 hours to process data. PAST (Pathway Association Study Tool), a new implementation of this method, has been developed to address these concerns.\\n\\nResultsPAST is implemented as a package for the R language. Two user-interfaces are provided; PAST can be run by loading the package in R and calling its methods, or by using an R Shiny guided user interface. In testing, PAST completed analyses in approximately one hour by processing data in parallel. PAST has many user-specified options for maximum customization. PAST produces the same results as the previously developed method.\\n\\nConclusionsIn order to promote a powerful new method of pathway analysis that interprets GWAS data to find biological mechanisms associated with traits of interest, we developed a more accessible and user friendly tool. This tool is more efficient and requires less knowledge of programming languages to use than previous methods. Moreover, it produces similar results in significantly less time. These attributes make PAST accessible to researchers interested in associating metabolic pathways with GWAS datasets to better understand the genetic architecture and mechanisms affecting phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a unique form of X-chromosome dosage compensation has been demonstrated in human preimplantation embryos, which happens through the dampening of X-linked gene expression from both X-chromosomes. Subsequently, X-chromosome dampening has also been demonstrated in female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) during the transition from primed to naive state. However, the existence of dampened X-chromosomes remains controversial in both embryos and hPSCs. Specifically, in preimplantation embryos it has been shown that there is inactivation of X-chromosome instead of dampening. Here, we have performed allelic analysis of X-linked genes at the single cell level in hPSCs and found that there is partial reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome instead of chromosome-wide dampening upon conversion from primed to naive state. In addition, our analysis suggests that the reduced X-linked gene expression in naive hPSCs might be the consequence of erasure of active X-chromosome upregulation.",

However, VHH have not been widely used in the central nervous system (CNS), as it is hard to reach therapeutic levels, both because of their restricted blood-brain-barrier penetration and their apparent rapid clearance from the parenchyma. Here, we propose a gene transfer strategy based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors to deliver VHH directly into the CNS, ensuring continuous production at therapeutic levels. As a proof-of-concept, we explored the potential of AAV-delivered VHH to inhibit BACE1, a well-characterized target in Alzheimers disease. First, we generated a panel of VHHs targeting BACE1. One of them, VHH-B9, showed high selectivity for BACE1 and efficacy in lowering BACE1 activity in vitro. We then went on to demonstrate significant reductions in amyloid beta (A{beta}) levels after AAV-based delivery of VHH-B9 into the CNS of a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. These results constitute a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases, which is applicable to a range of CNS disease targets.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a key clearance process to recycle damaged cellular components. One important upstream regulator of autophagy is the ULK1 kinase. Several structures of the ULK1 kinase domain have been solved, but a comprehensive study, including molecular dynamics, is missing. Also, an exhaustive description of ULK1 alterations found in cancer samples is presently lacking. We here applied a framework which links -omics data to structural protein ensembles to study ULK1 alterations from genomics data available for more that 30 cancer types. Moreover, we predicted the effects of mutations on ULK1 function and structural stability, accounting for protein dynamics and the different layers of changes that a mutation can induce in a protein at the functional and structural level.\n\nWe find that ULK1 is down-regulated in gynecological tumors. In other cancer types, ULK2 could compensate for ULK1 downregulation and, in the majority of the cases, no marked changes in expression have been found. 36 missense mutations of ULK1 are co-occurring with mutations in a large number of ULK1 interactors, suggesting a pronounced effect of the upstream steps of autophagy in many cancer types. Moreover, our results pinpoint that more than 50% of the ULK1 mutations that we studied are predicted to affect protein stability. Three mutations (S184F, D102N, and A28V) are predicted with only impact on kinase activity, either modifying the functional dynamics or the capability to exert effects from distal site to the functional and catalytic regions. The framework here applied could be extended to other protein targets to aid the classification of missense mutations from cancer genomics studies, as well as to prioritize variants for experimental validation, or to select the appropriate biological readouts for experiments.",

    "abstract": "During cell division, cells must actively pass on organelles. Previously, we discovered the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway that ensures the inheritance of functional ER. Activation of the ERSU causes the septin ring to mislocalize, which blocks ER inheritance and cytokinesis. Here, we found that the septin ring mislocalizes to previously utilized cell division sites called cytokinetic remnants (CRMs). The transfer of the septin ring to CRMs requires Nba1, a negative polarity component that normally prevents septin ring formation at CRMs. Furthermore, septin ring movement to CRMs relies on the ERSU component Slt2, which is recruited by binding Bem1. During ER stress, Bem1 also binds the GTP exchange factor Cdc24, without activating Cdc42, a GTPase that normally establishes polarized growth. Failure to translocate septin rings to CRMs delays the cells ability to re-enter cell division when ER homeostasis is re-established. Thus, ER stress considers the history of previous cell cycle for future cell cycle re-entry upon ER stress recovery.",

The gutimmune co-culture (GIC) was developed to model important aspects of the human small intestine by the inclusion of mucin producing goblet cells, human enterocytes, and dendritic cells, bringing together a mucus-containing epithelial monolayer with elements of the innate immune system. The utility of the system was demonstrated by characterizing host-pathogen interactions facilitated by N-linked glycosylation, such as host epithelial barrier functions, bacterial invasion and immunogenicity. Changes in human intestinal barrier functions in the presence of 11168 C. jejuni (wildtype) strains were quantified using GICs. The glycosylationdeficient strain 11168 {Delta}pglE was 100-fold less capable of adhering to and invading this intestinal model in cell infectivity assays. Quantification of inflammatory signaling revealed that 11168{Delta}pglE differentially modulated inflammatory responses in different intestinal microenvironments, suppressive in some but activating in others. Virulence-associated outer membrane vesicles produced by wildtype and 11168{Delta}pglE C. jejuni were shown to have differential composition and function, with both leading to immune system activation when provided to the gut-immune co-culture model. This analysis of aspects of C. jejuni infectivity in the presence and absence of its N-linked glycome, is enabled by application of the gut-immune model and we anticipate that this system will be applicable to further studies of C. jejuni and other enteropathogens of interest.",

    "abstract": "Neural adaptation enables sensory information to be represented optimally in the brain despite large fluctuations over time in the statistics of the environment. Auditory contrast gain control represents an important example, which is thought to arise primarily from cortical processing. We find, however, that neurons in both the auditory thalamus and midbrain of mice show robust contrast gain control, and that this is implemented independently of cortical activity. Although neurons at each level exhibit contrast gain control to similar degrees, adaptation time constants become longer at later stages of the processing hierarchy, resulting in progressively more stable representations. We also show that auditory discrimination thresholds in human listeners compensate for changes in contrast, and that the strength of this perceptual adaptation can be predicted from physiological measurements. Contrast adaptation is therefore a robust property of both the subcortical and cortical auditory system and accounts for the short-term adaptability of perceptual judgments.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated K+ channel Kv2.1 serves a major structural role in the soma and proximal dendrites of brain neurons, tethering the plasma membrane (PM) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although Kv2.1 clustering at neuronal ER-PM junctions (EPJs) is tightly regulated and conserved across species, its function at these sites is unclear. By identifying and evaluating proteins in close spatial proximity to Kv2.1-containing EPJs, we discovered that a significant role of Kv2.1 at EPJs is to promote the clustering and functional coupling of PM L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) to ryanodine receptor (RyR) ER Ca2+ release channels. Kv2.1 clustering also unexpectedly enhanced LTCC opening at polarized membrane potentials. This enabled Kv2.1-LTCC-RyR triads to generate localized Ca2+ release events (i.e., Ca2+ sparks) independently of action potentials. Together, these findings uncover a novel mode of LTCC regulation and establish a unique mechanism whereby Kv2.1-associated EPJs provide a molecular platform for localized somatodendritic Ca2+ signals.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions and protein localization are essential mechanisms of cellular signal transduction. The ability to externally control such interactions using chemical and optogenetic methods has facilitated biological research and provided components for the engineering of cell-based therapies and materials. However, chemical and optical methods are limited in their ability to provide spatiotemporal specificity in light-scattering tissues. To overcome these limitations, we present \\\"thermomers,\\\" modular protein dimerization domains controlled with temperature - a form of energy that can be delivered to cells both globally and locally in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo contexts. Thermomers are based on a sharply thermolabile coiled-coil protein, which we engineered to heterodimerize at a tunable transition temperature within the biocompatible range of 37-42 {degrees}C. When fused to other proteins, thermomers can reversibly control their association, as demonstrated via membrane localization in mammalian cells. This technology enables remote control of intracellular protein-protein interactions with a form of energy that can be delivered with spatiotemporal precision in a wide range of biological, therapeutic and living material scenarios.",
