    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is revolutionising biodiversity monitoring, but has unrealised potential for ecological hypothesis generation and testing. Here, we validate this potential in a large-scale analysis of vertebrate community data generated by eDNA metabarcoding of 532 UK ponds. We test biotic associations between the threatened great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and other vertebrates as well as abiotic factors influencing T. cristatus detection at the pondscape. Furthermore, we test the status of T. cristatus as an umbrella species for pond conservation by assessing whether vertebrate species richness is greater in ponds with T. cristatus and higher T. cristatus Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) scores. T. cristatus detection was positively correlated with amphibian and waterfowl species richness. Specifically, T. cristatus was positively associated with smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common coot (Fulica atra), and common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), but negatively associated with common toad (Bufo bufo). T. cristatus detection did not significantly decrease as fish species richness increased, but negative associations with common carp (Cyprinus carpio), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) were identified. T. cristatus detection was negatively correlated with mammal species richness, and T. cristatus was negatively associated with grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). T. cristatus detection was negatively correlated with larger pond area, presence of inflow, and higher percentage of shading, but positively correlated with HSI score, supporting its application to T. cristatus survey. Vertebrate species richness was significantly higher in T. cristatus ponds and broadly increased as T. cristatus HSI scores increased. We reaffirm reported associations (e.g. T. cristatus preference for smaller ponds) but also provide novel insights, including a negative effect of pond inflow on T. cristatus. Our findings demonstrate the prospects of eDNA metabarcoding for ecological hypothesis generation and testing at landscape scale, and dramatic enhancement of freshwater conservation, management, monitoring and research.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have reported that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing induces a p53-dependent DNA damage response in primary cells, which may select for cells with oncogenic p53 mutations11,12. It is unclear whether these CRISPR-induced changes are applicable to different cell types, and whether CRISPR gene editing may select for other oncogenic mutations. Addressing these questions, we analyzed genome-wide CRISPR and RNAi screens to systematically chart the mutation selection potential of CRISPR knockouts across the whole exome. Our analysis suggests that CRISPR gene editing can select for mutants of KRAS and VHL, at a level comparable to that reported for p53. These predictions were further validated in a genome-wide manner by analyzing independent CRISPR screens and patients tumor data. Finally, we performed a new set of pooled and arrayed CRISPR screens to evaluate the competition between CRISPR-edited isogenic p53 WT and mutant cell lines, which further validated our predictions. In summary, our study systematically charts and points to the potential selection of specific cancer driver mutations during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAbiotic and biotic stresses related to climate change have been associated to increased crown defoliation, decreased growth and a higher risk of mortality in many forest tree species, but the impact of stresses on tree reproduction and forest regeneration remains understudied. At dry, warm margin of species distributions, flowering, pollination and seed maturation processes are expected to be affected by drought, late frost and other stresses, eventually resulting in reproduction failure. Moreover, inter-individual variations in reproductive performances versus other performances (growth, survival) could have important consequences on populations dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated the relationships between individual crown defoliation, growth and reproduction in a drought-prone population of European beech, Fagus sylvatica. We used a spatially explicit mating model and marker-based parentage analyses to estimate effective female and male fecundities of 432 reproductive trees, which were also monitored for basal area increment and crown defoliation over nine years.\\nC_LIO_LIFemale and male fecundities markedly varied among individuals, more than did growth. Both female fecundity and growth decreased with increasing crown defoliation and competition and increased with size. Male fecundity only responded to competition, and decreased with increasing competition. Moreover, the negative effect of defoliation on female fecundity was size-dependent, with a slower decline in female fecundity with increasing defoliation for the large individuals. Finally, a trade-off between growth and female fecundity was observed in response to defoliation: some large trees maintained significant female fecundity at the expense of reduced growth in response to defoliation, while some other defoliated trees rather maintained high growth at the expense of reduced female fecundity.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Our results suggest that while decreasing their growth, some large defoliated trees still contribute to reproduction through seed production and pollination. This non-coordinated decline of growth and fecundity at individual-level in response to stress may compromise the evolution of stress-resistance traits at population level, and increase forest tree vulnerability.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Shortening of 3'UTRs (3'US) through alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a post-transcriptional mechanism that regulate expression of hundreds of genes in human cancers. In breast cancer, different subtypes of tumor samples, such as estrogen receptor positive and negative (ER+ and ER-), are characterized by distinct molecular mechanisms, suggesting possible differences in the post-transcriptional regulation between the subtype tumors. In this study, based on the profound tumorigenic role of 3'US interacting with competing-endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network (3'US-ceRNA effect), we hypothesize that the 3'US-ceRNA effect drives subtype-specific tumor growth. However, we found that the subtypes are available in different sample size, biasing the ceRNA network size and disabling the fair comparison of the 3'US-ceRNA effect. Using normalized Laplacian Matrix Eigenvalue Distribution, we addressed this bias and built the tumor ceRNA networks comparable between the subtypes. Based on the comparison, we identified a novel role of housekeeping (HK) genes as stable and strong miRNA sponges (sponge HK genes) that synchronize the ceRNA networks of normal samples (adjacent to ER+ and ER- tumor samples). We further found that distinct 3'US events in the ER- tumor break the stable sponge effect of HK genes in a subtype-specific fashion, especially in association with the aggressive and metastatic phenotypes. Knockdown of NUDT21, a master 3'-UTR regulator in HeLa cells, confirmed the causal role of 3'US-ceRNA effect repressing HK genes for tumor growth. In this study, we identified 3'US-ceRNA effect on the sponge HK genes for subtype-specific growth of ER- tumors.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal stem cell (ISC) plasticity is thought to be regulated by broadly-permissive chromatin shared between ISCs and their progeny. Here, we utilize a Sox9EGFP reporter to examine chromatin across ISC differentiation. We find that open chromatin regions (OCRs) can be defined as broadly-permissive or dynamic in a locus-specific manner, with dynamic OCRs found primarily in loci consistent with distal enhancers. By integrating gene expression with chromatin accessibility at transcription factor (TF) motifs in context of Sox9EGFP populations, we classify broadly-permissive and dynamic chromatin relative to TF usage. These analyses identify known and potential regulators of ISC differentiation via their association with dynamic changes in chromatin. We observe ISC expansion in Id3-null mice, consistent with computational predictions. Finally, we examine the relationship between gene expression and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in Sox9EGFP populations, which reveals 5hmC enrichment in absorptive lineage specific genes. Our data demonstrate that intestinal chromatin dynamics can be quantitatively defined in a locus-specific manner, identify novel potential regulators of ISC differentiation, and provide a chromatin roadmap for further dissecting the role of cis regulation of cell fate in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "Infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by the ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum is characterised by an early symptomless biotrophic phase followed by a destructive necrotrophic phase. The fungal genome contains 77 secondary metabolism-related biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), and their expression during the infection process is tightly regulated. Deleting CclA, a chromatin regulator involved in repression of some BGCs through H3K4 trimethylation, allowed overproduction of 3 families of terpenoids and isolation of 12 different molecules. These natural products were tested in combination with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor of jasmonate responses, for their capacity to alter defence gene induction in Arabidopsis. Higginsianin B inhibited MeJA-triggered expression of the defence reporter VSP1p:GUS, suggesting it may block bioactive JA-Ile synthesis or signalling in planta. Using the JA-Ile sensor Jas9-VENUS, we found that higginsianin B, but not three other structurally-related molecules, suppressed JA-Ile signalling by preventing degradation of JAZ proteins, the repressors of JA responses. Higginsianin B likely blocks the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins because it inhibited chymotrypsin- and caspase-like protease activities. The inhibition of target degradation by higginsianin B also extended to auxin signalling, as higginsianin B treatment reduced IAA-dependent expression of DR5p:GUS. Overall, our data indicate that specific fungal secondary metabolites can act similarly to protein effectors to subvert plant immune and developmental responses.\\n\\nHighlightA diterpene secondary metabolite produced by a fungal pathogen suppresses plant jasmonate defense signalling by preventing the proteasomal degradation of JAZ repressor proteins.",

However, the effect of normal aging on these oscillations is not known, especially for elderly subjects (>49 years) for which AD is most prevalent. In a first large-scale (236 subjects; 104 females) electroencephalogram (EEG) study on gamma oscillations on elderly subjects (aged 50-88 years), we presented full-screen Cartesian gratings that induced two distinct gamma oscillations (slow: 20-34 Hz and fast: 36-66 Hz). Power and centre frequency significantly decreased with age for both slow and fast gamma, but not alpha (8-12 Hz). Reduction was more salient for fast gamma than slow. These results were independent of microsaccades and pupillary reactivity to stimulus, as well as variations in power spectral density with age. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) also reduced with age. These results are crucial first steps towards using gamma/SSVEPs as biomarkers of cognitive decline in elderly.\\n\\nSignificance statementNo study in humans has examined visual narrow-band gamma oscillations with healthy aging in elderly subjects.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEntomological monitoring of Aedes vectors has largely relied on surveillance of larvae, pupae and non-host-seeking adults, which have been poorly correlated with human disease incidence. Exposure to mosquito-borne diseases can be more directly estimated using Human Landing Catches (HLC), although this method is not recommended for Aedes-borne arboviruses. We evaluated a new method previously tested with malaria vectors, the Mosquito Electrocuting Trap (MET) as an exposure-free alternative for measuring landing rates of Aedes mosquitoes on people. Aims were to 1) compare the MET to the BG-sentinel (BGS) trap gold standard approach for sampling host-seeking Aedes vectors; 2) characterize the diel activity of Aedes vectors and their association with microclimatic conditions.\\n\\nMethodsThe study was conducted over 12 days in Quininde - Ecuador in May 2017. Mosquito sampling stations were set up in the peridomestic area of four houses. On each day of sampling, each house was allocated either a MET or a BGS trap, which were rotated amongst the four houses daily in a Latin square design. Mosquito abundance and microclimatic conditions were recorded hourly at each sampling station between 07:00-19:00 hours to assess variation between vector abundance, trapping methods, and environmental conditions. All Aedes aegypti females were tested for the presence of Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses.\\n\\nResultsA higher number of Ae. aegypti females were found in MET than in BGS collections, although no statistically significant differences in mean Ae. aegypti abundance between trapping methods were found. Both trapping methods indicated female Ae. aegypti had bimodal patterns of host seeking, being highest during early morning and late afternoon hours. Mean Ae. aegypti daily abundance was negatively associated with daily temperature. No infection by ZIKV, DENV or CHIKV was detected in any Aedes mosquitoes caught by either trapping method.\\n\\nConclusionWe conclude the MET performs at least as well as the BGS standard, and offers the additional advantage of direct measurement of per capita human biting rates. If detection of arboviruses can be confirmed in MET-collected Aedes in future studies, this surveillance method could provide a valuable tool for surveillance and prediction on human arboviral exposure risk.",

Its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, however. We used RNAseq from BLApn to identify learning-related changes in Stk11, a kinase with well-studied roles in growth, metabolism and development, but not previously implicated in learning. Deletion of Stk11 restricted to BLApn completely blocks memory when occurring prior to training, but not following it, despite altering neither BLApn-dependent encoding of taste palatability in gustatory cortex, nor transcriptional activation of BLApn during training. Deletion of Stk11 in BLApn also increases their intrinsic excitability. Conversely, BLApn activated by CTA to express the immediate early gene Fos had reduced excitability. BLApn knockout of Fos also increased excitability and impaired learning. These data suggest that Stk11 and Fos expression play key roles in CTA long-term memory formation, perhaps by modulating the intrinsic excitability of BLApn.",

    "abstract": "Memory in animals is labile in the early phase post-training. Memory in the early phase has been shown to be disrupted by treatments such as electroconvulsive shock or cold-shock (Quinn and Dudai, 1976). Using hypothermic shock and other pharmacological interventions, the various underlying memory pathways in Drosophila can be identified as an immediate short-lasting anesthesia sensitive memory and a delayed anesthesia resistant memory which is followed by a more stable protein synthesis dependent long-term memory (Margulies et al., 2005). In another ectothermic animal, Danio rerio, a popular vertebrate model, we ask if such a memory component exists which is sensitive to hypothermic disruption. To test this, we developed a fear conditioning assay with a green light at the bottom of the tank as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and electric shock as the unconditioned stimulus (US). We also standardized a cold anesthesia protocol in adult zebrafish to induce stage V anesthesia. The learning/memory was found to be NMDA-R mediated. Cold anesthesia as well as tricaine mediated anesthesia did not significantly affect the early-acting memory trace induced by a fear-conditioning protocol in adult zebrafish. We suggest future directions to tease out the underlying memory components in the early phase of memory in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Due to cost and logistical reasons, Epigenome-Wide-Association Studies (EWAS) are normally performed in complex tissues, resulting in average DNA methylation profiles over potentially many different cell-types, which can obscure important cell-type specific associations with disease. Identifying the specific cell-types that are altered is a key hurdle for elucidating causal pathways to disease, and consequently statistical algorithms have recently emerged that aim to address this challenge. Comparisons between these algorithms are of great interest, yet here we find that the main comparative study so far was substantially biased and potentially misleading. By using this study as an example, we highlight some of the key issues that need to be considered to ensure that future assessments between methods are more objective.",

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an oxidative iron-dependent form of cell death recently described in eukaryotic organisms like animals, plants and parasites. Here we report that a similar process takes place in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in response to heat stress. After a heat shock, Synechocystis cells undergo a cell death pathway that can be suppressed by canonical ferroptosis inhibitors or by external addition of calcium, glutathione or ascorbic acid. Moreover, as described for eukaryotic cells ferroptosis, this pathway is characterized by an early depletion of antioxidants, and by lipid peroxidation. As in general prokaryotes membranes contain poorly oxidizable saturated or monounsaturated lipid molecules, it was thought that they were not susceptible to ferroptosis. Interestingly, cyanobacteria contain thylakoid membranes that are enriched in polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-containing phospholipids, which might explain their sensitivity to ferroptosis. These results indicate that all of the hallmarks described for eukaryotic ferroptosis are conserved in photosynthetic prokaryotes and suggest that ferroptosis might be an ancient cell death program.\\n\\nSummaryAguilera et al, show that ferroptosis, an oxidative and iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, plays an important role in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

    "abstract": "Here we report a highly sensitive DNB-based on-chip Motif Finding (DocMF) system that utilizes high throughput next-generation-sequencing (NGS) chips to profile protein binding or cleaving activity. Using DocMF, we successfully identified a variety of endonuclease recognition sites and the protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) sequences of different CRISPR systems. Our DocMF platform can simultaneously screen both 5 and 3 PAM regions with high coverage using the same NGS library/chip. For the well-studied SpCas9, our DocMF platform identified a small proportion of noncanonical 5-NAG-3 ([~]5%) and 5-NGA-3 ([~]1.6%), in addition to its common PAMs, 5-NGG-3 ([~]89.9%). We also used the DocMF to assay two uncharacterized Cas endonucleases, VeCas9 and BvCpf1. VeCas9 PAMs were not detected by the conventional PAM depletion method. However, DocMF discovered that both VeCas9 and BvCpf1 required broader and more complicated PAM sequences for target recognition. VeCas9 preferred the R-rich motifs, whereas BvCpf1 used the T-rich PAMs. Moreover, after slightly changing the experimental protocol, we observed that dCas9, a DNA-binding protein lacking endonuclease activity, preferably binded to the previously reported PAMs 5-NGG-3. In summary, our studies demonstrate that DocMF is the first tool with the capacity to exhaustively assay both the binding and the cutting properties of different DNA-binding proteins.",

    "abstract": "A large proportion of membrane proteins must be assembled into oligomeric complexes for function. How this process occurs is poorly understood, but it is clear that complex assembly must be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of orphan subunits with potential cytotoxic effects. We interrogated assembly in mammalian cells using a model system of the WRB/CAML complex: an essential insertase for tail-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our data suggests that the stability of each subunit is differentially regulated. In WRBs absence, CAML folds incorrectly, causing aberrant exposure of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain to the cytosol. When present, WRB can post-translationally correct the topology of CAML both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, WRB can independently fold correctly, but is still degraded in the absence of CAML. We therefore propose at least two distinct regulatory pathways for the surveillance of orphan subunits during complex assembly in the mammalian ER.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty in risks posed by emerging stressors such as synthetic hormones impedes conservation efforts for threatened vertebrate populations. Synthetic hormones often induce sex-biased perturbations in exposed animals by disrupting gonad development and early life-history stage transitions, potentially diminishing per capita reproductive output of depleted populations and, in turn, being manifest as Allee effects. We use a spatially-explicit biophysical model to evaluate how sex-biased perturbation in life history traits of individuals (maternal investment in egg production and male-skewed sex allocation in offspring) modulates density feedback control of year class strength and recovery trajectories of a long-lived, migratory fish-shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus)-under spatially and temporally dynamic synthetic androgen exposure and habitat conditions. Simulations show that reduced efficiency of maternal investment in gonad development prolonged maturation time, increased the probability of skipped spawning, and, in turn, gradually shrunk spawner abundance, weakening year class strength. However, positive density feedback quickly disappeared (no Allee effect) once the exposure ceased. By contrast, responses to the demographic perturbation manifested as strong positive density feedback; an abrupt shift in year class strength and spawner abundance followed after more than two decades owing to persistent negative population growth (a strong Allee effect), reaching an alternate state without any sign of recovery. When combined with the energetic perturbation, positive density feedback of the demographic perturbation was dampened as extended maturation time reduced the frequency of producing male-biased offspring, allowing the population to maintain positive growth rate (a weak Allee effect) and gradually recover. The emergent patterns in long-term population projections illustrate that sex-biased perturbation in life history traits of individuals can interactively regulate the strength of density feedback in depleted populations such as Scaphirhynchus sturgeon to further diminish reproductive capacity and abundance, posing increasingly greater conservation challenges in chemically altered riverscapes.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite capable of invading any nucleated cell. Three main clonal lineages (type I, II, III) exist and murine models have driven the understanding of general and strain-specific immune mechanisms underlying Toxoplasma infection. However, murine models are limited for studying parasite-leukocyte interactions in vivo, and discrepancies exist between cellular immune responses observed in mouse versus human cells. Here, we develop a zebrafish infection model to study the innate immune response to Toxoplasma in vivo. By infecting the zebrafish hindbrain ventricle, and using high-resolution microscopy techniques coupled with computer vision driven automated image analysis, we reveal that Toxoplasma invades and replicates inside a parasitophorous vacuole to which type I and III parasites recruit host cell mitochondria. We show that type II and III strains maintain a higher infectious burden than type I strains. To understand how parasites are being cleared in vivo, we analyzed Toxoplasma-macrophage interactions using time-lapse and correlative light and electron microscopy. Strikingly, macrophages are recruited to the infection site and play a key role in Toxoplasma control. These results highlight in vivo control of Toxoplasma by macrophages, and illuminate the possibility to exploit zebrafish for discoveries within the field of parasite immunity.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of new populations is contingent on overcoming abiotic and biotic barriers. While this applies to all species, these hurdles are at the forefront of invasion biology where prediction, prevention, eradication, and control strategies depend on an understanding and exploitation of barriers to establishment and spread. Arundina graminifolia and Dendrobium crumenatum are two invasive orchids spreading throughout Puerto Rico. Current records on their distributions across the island are sparse, and their interactions with the surrounding ecosystem are unknown. Through a direct population survey of all known localities, we identified a new, acquired enemy of both orchids: the orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita. In this study, we used niche modelling to identify suitable habitats for each orchid on the island and map their current distributions and interactions with S. polita, along with their distributions in the most extreme climate scenario in 2050, in order to contextualize projected patterns of establishment on the island. Our findings show that D. crumenatum flourishes in urban environments which also provide refugia from S. polita. In contrast, there is currently no refugia for A. graminifolia from S. polita attack, as it is more sensitive to the same climatic variables as S. polita. Furthermore, projections into the most extreme climate scenario suggests Puerto Rico will be unsuitable for A. graminifolia and S. politas survival, and become less suitable for D. crumenatum, by 2050.",

    "abstract": "Tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs) play a variety of recently described roles in innate immunity. While many TRIMs regulate type I interferon (IFN) expression following cytosolic nucleic acid sensing of viruses, their contribution to innate immune signaling and gene expression during bacterial infection remains largely unknown. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a potent activator of cGAS-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing, we set out to investigate a role for TRIM proteins in regulating macrophage responses to M. tuberculosis. Here we demonstrate that TRIM14, a non-canonical TRIM that lacks an E3 ligase RING domain, is a critical negative regulator of the type I IFN response in macrophages. We show that TRIM14 physically interacts with both cGAS and TBK1 and that macrophages lacking TRIM14 dramatically hyperinduce interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression following cytosolic nucleic acid transfection, IFN-{beta} treatment, and M. tuberculosis infection. Consistent with a defect in resolution of the type I IFN response, Trim14 knockout (KO) macrophages have more phospho-Ser754 STAT3 relative to phospho-727 and fail to upregulate the STAT3 target Socs3 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3), which is required to turn off IFNAR signaling. These data support a model whereby TRIM14 acts as a scaffold between TBK1 and STAT3 to promote phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and enhance negative regulation of ISG expression. Remarkably, Trim14 KO macrophages hyperinduce antimicrobials like Inos2 and are significantly better than control cells at limiting M. tuberculosis replication. Collectively, these data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRIM14 in resolving type I IFN responses and controlling M. tuberculosis infection.",

Interferometric schemes using two high numerical aperture objectives, such as 4Pi confocal and I5M microscopy, have improved the axial resolution beyond that of the lateral, but at the cost of a significantly more complex optical setup.

    "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating is the gold-standard in archaeology to estimate the age of skeletons, a key to studying their origins. Nearly half of all published ancient human genomes lack reliable and direct dates, which results in obscure and contradictory reports. Here, we developed the Temporal Population Structure (TPS), the first DNA-based dating method for ancient genomes ranging from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern-day samples and applied it to 1559 ancient Europeans, Asians, and Caucasus individuals and to 2117 modern worldwide individuals. We show that TPS predictions for dated skeletons align with their known dates and correctly account for kin relationships. The TPS-dating of poorly dated Eurasian samples resolves conflicts and sheds new light on disputed findings, as illustrated by four test cases. We discuss the phenotypic traits of the Time Informative Markers (TIMs) that underlie TPS.\n\nSummaryTPS is a novel method to date humans from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern time from their DNA sequences.\n\nAccurate dating is essential to the interepretation of paleogemonic data.. The gold-standard method in archaeology is radiocarbon dating1. However, a major limitation of radiocarbon dating is the high amount of collagen extraction (500 mg) involved in the process2. Consequently, half of all published ancient human genomes lack reliable and direct dates, which results in obscure and contradictory reports. Here, we present the Temporal Population Structure (TPS), the first genomic dating method for ancient genomes ranging from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern-day samples. We show that TPS predictions for 961 radiocarbon-dated Eurasian skeletons align with their known dates. We replicate these findings on 598 other Europeans, Asians and Caucasus individuals. Using kin-pairs, we demonstrate that TPS has produced more accurate results than radiocarbon and other dating.

    "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating is the gold-standard in archaeology to estimate the age of skeletons, a key to studying their origins. Nearly half of all published ancient human genomes lack reliable and direct dates, which results in obscure and contradictory reports. Here, we developed the Temporal Population Structure (TPS), the first DNA-based dating method for ancient genomes ranging from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern-day samples and applied it to 1559 ancient Europeans, Asians, and Caucasus individuals and to 2117 modern worldwide individuals. We show that TPS predictions for dated skeletons align with their known dates and correctly account for kin relationships. The TPS-dating of poorly dated Eurasian samples resolves conflicts and sheds new light on disputed findings, as illustrated by four test cases. We discuss the phenotypic traits of the Time Informative Markers (TIMs) that underlie TPS.\n\nSummaryTPS is a novel method to date humans from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern time from their DNA sequences.\n\nAccurate dating is essential to the interepretation of paleogemonic data.. The gold-standard method in archaeology is radiocarbon dating1. However, a major limitation of radiocarbon dating is the high amount of collagen extraction (500 mg) involved in the process2. Consequently, half of all published ancient human genomes lack reliable and direct dates, which results in obscure and contradictory reports. Here, we present the Temporal Population Structure (TPS), the first genomic dating method for ancient genomes ranging from the Upper Palaeolithic to modern-day samples. We show that TPS predictions for 961 radiocarbon-dated Eurasian skeletons align with their known dates. We replicate these findings on 598 other Europeans, Asians and Caucasus individuals. Using kin-pairs, we demonstrate that TPS has produced more accurate results than radiocarbon and other dating. We show how our findings resolve conflicts and sheds new light on disputed findings as illustrated by four test cases. Finally, we discuss the phenotypic traits of the Time Informative Markers (TIMs) that underlie TPS. TPS is a novel dating technique, which can be used when radiocarbon dating is unfeasible or uncertain or to develop alternative hypotheses.

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulins are highly diverse, diverging from their originating germline genes driven primarily by somatic recombination and hypermutation. However, somatic gene conversion is a strong driver of immunoglobulin diversity in some species, including rabbits and chickens. It is considerably harder to detect by sequence analysis than point mutations, and currently no dedicated tools exist for identifying these events. We present GECCO, the first dedicated gene conversion identification tool for immunoglobulins based on modified, simultaneous, pairwise alignments to host and donor references. We benchmark our approach on simulated repertoires and find GECCO has high recall, low false positive rate, and is insensitive to somatic mutations. We apply this new approach to characterize gene conversion events at the repertoire level in hyper-immunized rabbits, to show patterns of donor V gene preferences and donor tract length distributions. The dedicated gene conversion identification method we present allows for the characterization of a new feature of antibody repertoires that has not been possible thus far. GECCO will benefit future studies to explore the prevalence of immunoglobulin gene conversion in additional species.",

    "abstract": "Recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) have been associated with birth defects, including microcephaly and neurological impairment. However, the mechanisms which confer increased susceptibility to ZIKV during pregnancy remain unclear. We hypothesized that poor outcomes from ZIKV infection during pregnancy are due in part to pregnancy-induced alteration of innate immune cell frequencies and cytokine expression. To examine the impact of pregnancy on innate immune responses, we inoculated pregnant and non-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice with 5x105 FFU of ZIKV intravaginally. Innate immune cell frequencies and cytokine expression were measured by flow cytometry at day 3 post infection. Compared to non-pregnant mice, pregnant mice exhibited higher frequencies of uterine macrophages (CD68+) and tolerogenic dendritic cells (CD11c+ CD103+ and CD11c+ CD11b+). Additionally, ZIKV-infected pregnant mice had lower frequencies of CD45+ IL-12+ and CD11b+ IL-12+ cells in the uterus and spleen. These data show that pregnancy results in an altered innate immune response to ZIKV infection in the genital tract of mice and that pregnancy-associated immune modulation may play an important role in the severity of acute ZIKV infection.\\n\\nImportancePregnant females longer duration that viremia following infection with Zika virus but the mechanism of this is not established. Innate immune cellular responses are important for controlling virus infection and are important for development and maintenance of pregnancy. Thus, the acute immune response to Zika virus during pregnancy may be altered so that the pregnancy can be maintained. To examine this interaction, we utilized a mouse model of Zika virus infection during pregnancy using intravaginal inoculation. We found that following Zika virus infection, pregnant mice exhibited increased expression of tolerant or non-inflammatory dendritic cells. Additionally, we found that pregnant mice have significantly depressed ability to secrete the cytokine IL-12 from innate immune cells in the uterus and the spleen while maintaining MHCII expression. These findings show that pregnancy-induced changes in the innate immune cells are biased towards tolerance and can result in decreased antigen-dependent stimulation of immune responses.",

MCM10 has not been previously associated with monogenic disease and plays a critical role in the activation and function of the eukaryotic DNA replisome.

    "abstract": "The type VII secretion system ESX-1 mediates virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. We find that in M. marinum, the synthetic organoselenium compound ebselen inhibits secretion of ESAT-6, a major ESX-1 substrate. We find that ebselen inhibits the in vitro activity of the ESX-1 AAA+ ATPase EccA1, which potentiates ESX-1 substrate secretion and function. Ebselen modifies a cysteine in its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain that is required for EccA1s in vitro ATPase activity. Surprisingly, mutational analyses show this this cysteine is not required for ESX-1 secretion or ebselens activity, showing that ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion independently of inhibiting EccA1 activity in vitro. While the mechanism by which ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion remains elusive, we show that it attenuates ESX-1-mediated damage of M. marinum-containing macrophage phagosomes and inhibits intramacrophage growth. Extending our studies to M. tuberculosis, we find that ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion and phagosomal membrane damage in this organism. This work provides insight into EccA1 biology. Ebselen is an orally active drug in clinical trials for other conditions and this work suggests its potential in tuberculosis therapy.",

    "abstract": "Limiting microbial growth during drinking water distribution is achieved either by maintaining a disinfectant residual or through nutrient limitation without the use of a disinfectant. The impact of these contrasting approaches on the drinking water microbiome is not systematically understood. We utilized genome-resolved metagenomics to compare the structure, metabolic traits, and population genomes of drinking water microbiomes across multiple full-scale drinking water systems utilizing these two-distinct microbial growth control strategies. Microbial communities cluster together at the structural- and functional potential-level based on the presence or absence of a disinfectant residual. Disinfectant residual concentrations alone explained 17 and 6.5% of the variance in structure and functional potential of the drinking water microbiome, respectively, despite including samples from multiple drinking water systems with variable source waters and source water communities, treatment strategies, and chemical compositions. The drinking water microbiome is structurally and functionally less diverse and less variable across disinfected systems as compared to non-disinfected systems. While bacteria were the most abundant domain, archaea and eukaryota were more abundant in non-disinfected and disinfected systems, respectively. Community-level differences in functional potential were driven by enrichment of genes associated with carbon and nitrogen fixation in non-disinfected systems and {gamma}-aminobutyrate metabolism in disinfected systems which may be associated with the recycling of amino acids. Metagenome-assembled genome-level analyses for a subset of phylogenetically related microorganisms suggests that disinfection may select for microorganisms capable of using fatty acids, presumably from microbial decay products, via the glyoxylate cycle. Overall, we find that disinfection exhibits systematic and consistent selective pressures on the drinking water microbiome and may select for microorganisms able to utilize microbial decay products originating from disinfection inactivated microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Yeast RPL22A and RPL22B genes form an intergenic regulatory loop modulating the ratio of paralogous transcripts in response to changing levels of proteins. Gabunilas and Chanfreau (Gabunilas and Chanfreau, PLoS Genet 12, e1005999, 2016) and our group (Abrhamova et al., PLoS ONE 13, e0190685, 2018) described that Rpl22 proteins bound to the divergent introns of RPL22 paralogs and inhibited splicing in dosage dependent manner. Here, we continued to study the splicing regulation in more detail and designed constructs for in vivo analyses of splicing efficiency. We also tested Rpl22 binding to RPL22B intron in three-hybrid system. We were able to confirm the findings reported originally by Gabunilas and Chanfreau on the importance of a stem loop structure within the RPL22B intron. Mutations which lowered the stability of the structure abolished Rpl22-mediated inhibition. In contrast, we were not able to confirm the sequence specificity with respect to either Rpl22 binding or splicing inhibition within this region, which they reported. We contradict their results that the  RNA internal loop of RPL22Bi (nt 178CCCU181 and 221UGAA224) is crucial for mediating the Rpl22 effects. We assume that this discrepancy reflects the difference in constructs, as the reporters used by Gabunilas and Chanfreau lacked the alternative 5 splice site as well as surrounding exons. Our own comparison confirms that deleting the sequence spanning alternative 5 splice site lowers splicing efficiency, hinting to possible disturbances of the regulatory mechanism. We argue that the structural context of the  regulatory element may reach across the intron or into the surrounding sequences, similarly to what was found previously for other genes, such as RPL30. Apparently, more detailed analyses are needed to discern this intriguing example of splicing regulation.",

    "abstract": "The ability to search for and detect social cues, such as facial expressions of emotion, is critical to the understanding of complex dynamic social situations. This ability involves the coordinated actions of multiple cognitive domains, including face-emotion processing, mentalization, and visual attention. Individuals with schizophrenia are generally impaired in social cognition, and have been shown to have deficits in all of these domains. However, the whether the neural substrates of these impairments are shared or separate remains unclear. One candidate region for a shared substrate is the right temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS), which contains areas belonging to all of the cortical networks underlying these domains. Here we use functional MRI to examine differences in cortical activity evoked by a naturalistic movie, and link these results to impaired visual scanning and social cognition. 27 schizophrenia participants and 21 healthy controls watched a 15-minute clip of the movie \\\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\\" while high resolution multiband BOLD-fMRI activity was recorded. Inter-subject correlation was used to measure the evoked activity. BOLD-fMRI activity was also correlated with motion content in the movie, with the average activity in other cortical areas, and with frequency of saccades made during the movie. Visual scanning performance was measured in a separate behavioral experiment, and social cognition measured by The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). Contrasting the groups revealed that the TPJ-pSTS has the largest engagement deficit in both cortical hemispheres in schizophrenia patients versus healthy controls. Follow-up analyses find that brain activity in this region is less correlated with the motion content of the movie, that this region is abnormally synchronized to the other cortical areas involved in the cognitive domains underlying visual scanning of social scenes, and that activity this region is less correlated with the saccades made during the movie. Lastly, schizophrenia participant visual scanning performance of this clip was impaired compared to healthy controls, and correlated across the two groups with social cognition. These results indicate that the TPJ-pSTS plays less of an integral role in the coordination of face-emotion processing, mentalization, and visual attention in schizophrenia participants versus healthy controls. This functional deficit then impacts the visual scanning of a complex dynamic visual scenes, which in turn affects the comprehension of that scene. These findings indicating that the TPJ-pSTS is potentially the shared substrate for all of these deficits will lead to new treatments targeting this region to improve social cognition in individuals with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "CreER/LoxP system has enabled precise gene manipulation in distinct cell subpopulations at any specific time point upon tamoxifen (TAM) administration. This system is widely accepted to track neural lineages and study gene functions. We have observed prenatal TAM treatment caused high rate of delayed delivery and mortality of pups. These substances could promote undesired results, leading to data misinterpretation. Here, we report that TAM administration during early stages of cortical neurogenesis promoted precocious neural differentiation, while inhibited neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation. The TAM-induced inhibition of NPC proliferation led to deficits in cortical neurogenesis, dendritic morphogenesis, and cortical patterning in neonatal and postnatal offspring. Mechanistically, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis combined with in vivo and in vitro assays showed TAM could exert these drastic effects mainly through dysregulating the expression of Dmrta2 and Wnt8b. In adult mice, administration of TAM significantly attenuated NPC proliferation in both the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. This study revealed the cellular and molecular mechanisms for the adverse effects of prenatal tamoxifen administration on corticogenesis, suggesting that tamoxifen-induced CreER/LoxP system may not be suitable for neural lineage tracing and genetic manipulation studies in both embryonic and adult brains.\n\nSignificantFor the first time, our study revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen activities on cortical development.

    "abstract": "Dendritic spikes in thin dendritic branches (basal and oblique dendrites) of pyramidal neurons are traditionally inferred from spikelets measured in the cell body. Here, we used laser-spot voltage-sensitive dye imaging in cortical pyramidal neurons (rat brain slices) to investigate the voltage waveforms of dendritic potentials occurring in response to spatially-restricted glutamatergic inputs. Local dendritic potentials lasted 200-500 ms and propagated to the cell body where they caused sustained 10-20 mV depolarizations. Plateau potentials propagating from dendrite to soma, and action potentials propagating from soma to dendrite, created complex voltage waveforms in the middle of the thin basal dendrite, comprised of local sodium spikelets, local plateau potentials, and back-propagating action potentials, superimposed on each other. Our model replicated these experimental observations and made predictions, which were tested in experiments. Dendritic plateau potentials occurring in basal and oblique branches put pyramidal neurons into an activated neuronal state (\"prepared state\"), characterized by depolarized membrane potential and faster membrane responses. The prepared state provides a time window of 200-500 ms during which cortical neurons are particularly excitable and capable of following afferent inputs. At the network level, this predicts that sets of cells with simultaneous plateaus would provide cellular substrate for the formation of functional neuronal ensembles.\n\nNew & NoteworthyIn cortical pyramidal neurons, we recorded glutamate-mediated dendritic plateau potentials using voltage imaging, and created a computer model that recreated experimental measures from dendrite and cell body. Our model made new predictions, which were then tested in experiments. Plateau potentials profoundly change neuronal state -- a plateau potential triggered in one basal dendrite depolarizes the soma and shortens membrane time constant, making the cell more susceptible to firing triggered by other afferent inputs.",

Since cryptic species can not usually be detected when investigations are based exclusively on classical plant taxonomy, molecular markers and integrative taxonomy are important tools to elucidate the identity of cryptic taxa.\\n\\nMETHODSIn this paper we aimed to provide a detailed investigation based on molecular data and experimental taxonomy conducted on populations of a plant model occurring inside mesophytic forests and a supposed cryptic sympatric species that is found in marshy areas. Furthermore, a phylogeny was reconstructed by using nrDNA and cpDNA sequences in order to ascertain the position of both sympatric species within Liparis. The divergence among sequences of the putative cryptic sympatric species and related taxa was also verified based on DNA barcoding.\\n\\nKEY RESULTSOur results reveal cryptic sympatric speciation in the orchid genus Liparis. Differences in microhabitat, flowering phenology, morphology of leaves and flowers, and reproductive strategies support the taxon occurring in marshy areas is a cryptic species. The molecular analyses reveal the cryptic species is closely related to L. nervosa.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSPaludal Liparis is a sympatric cryptic species distinguishable from L. nervosa by differences in habitat, phenology and breeding system. Our conclusions are supported by the molecular investigations. The cryptic Liparis emerges as sister to L. nervosa, within a clade with terrestrial habitat and plicate leaves. The discovery of sympatric cryptic speciation in orchids provides increase on the knowledge of diversification and reproductive isolation in flowering plants.",

    "abstract": "The field performance of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is improved by sex-sorting and releasing only the sterile males. This can be accomplished by resource-intensive separation of males from females by morphology. Alternatively, sex-ratio biasing genetic constructs can be used to selectively kill one sex without the need for manual or automated sorting, but the resulting genetically engineered (GE) control agents would be subject to additional governmental regulation. Here we describe and demonstrate a method for the batch production of non-GE males that is applicable for sex-selective production of males suitable for genetic biocontrol programs. This method could be applied to generate the heterogametic sex (XY, or WZ) in any organism with chromosomal sex determination. We observed up to 100% sex-selection with batch cultures of more than 103 individuals. Using a stringent transgene detection assay, we demonstrate the potential of mass rearing of transgene free males.",

EvidentialGene methods are the most accurate in recovering reference genes, and maintain accuracy for alternate transcripts and paralogs.

Accuracy of protein calculations is compared, with errors found in popular methods, as is accuracy of transcript assemblers.

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR), is a transcription factor and a member of a hormone receptor superfamily. AR plays a vital role in the progression of prostate cancer and is a crucial target for therapeutic interventions. While the majority of advanced-stage prostate cancer patients will initially respond to the androgen-deprivation, the disease often progresses to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interestingly, CRPC tumors continue to depend on hyperactive AR signaling and will respond to potent second-line anti-androgen therapies, including bicalutamide (CASODEX(R)) and enzalutamide (XTANDI(R)). However, the progression-free survival rate for the CRPC patients on anti-androgen therapies is only 8 to 19 months. Hence, there is a need to understand the mechanisms underlying CRPC progression and eventual treatment resistance. Here, we have leveraged next-generation sequencing and newly developed analytical methodologies to evaluate the role of AR-signaling in regulating the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells. The genomic and pharmacologic stimulation- and inhibition-of AR activity demonstrates that AR regulates alternative splicing within cancer-relevant genes. Furthermore, by integrating transcriptomic data from in vitro experiments and in prostate cancer patients, we found that a significant number of AR-regulated splicing events are associated with tumor progression. For example, we found evidence for an inadvertent AR-antagonist mediated switch in IDH1 and PL2G2A isoform expression, which is associated with a decrease in overall survival of patients. Mechanistically, we discovered that the epithelial-specific splicing regulators (ESRP1 and ESRP2), flank many AR-regulated alternatively spliced exons. And, using 2D-invasion assays, we show that the inhibition of ESRPs can suppress AR-antagonist driven tumor invasion. In conclusion, until now, AR signaling has been primarily thought to modulate transcriptome of prostate epithelial cells by inducing or suppressing gene expression. Our work provides evidence for a new mechanism by which AR alters the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells by modulating alternative splicing. As such, our work has important implications for CRPC progression and development of resistance to treatment with bicalutamide and enzalutamide.",

    "abstract": "The Sigatoka leaf spots are among the most important banana diseases. Although less damaging than black sigatoka, yellow sigatoka (Pseudocercospora musae) still prevails in some regions. This study aimed at testing the hypothesis of light interference in monocyclic parameters of yellow sigatoka epidemics. Grande Naine plantlets kept under contrasting shading conditions had their leaves 1 and 2 inoculated. Evaluations were performed for 60 days. For each inoculated leaf, the time until symptom onset (incubation), presence of infectious lesions (latency), and disease severity (extensive leaf necrosis) according to Stovers scale modify per Gauhl (1994), called here only Stovers scale, were registered. Logistic regression was used to assess the relative occurrence risk and survival analysis was used to check the effects of variables on relevant epidemiological parameters. The risks of sporulation and of reaching high severities were lower for plants kept under shading regardless of the acclimation conditions and no effect of leaf age was detected. The logistic regression showed symptoms appearing in both conditions (p=0,85), but have significance difference in occurrence of latent lesions (p=0,013) and necrosis (p<0,0001). The necrosis risk in non-shaded environment arrived 66%. The survival analysis showed significance difference in the time to appear the symptom evaluated in all tested variables (p<0,0001) in function of the cropping system. Lower illuminance negatively affected the incubation, latency and infectious periods, and severity. A shaded system could be tested to produce organic bananas in areas of high risk of occurrence of Yellow sigatoka disease.\\n\\nSignificance and Impact of the StudyYellow Sigatoka (Pseudocercospora musae) is a banana disease that can cause severe damage if left uncontrolled. Its control is based mostly on fungicides.Our results show that shading downregulates the epidemiological parameters of that disease such as incubation, latent and infectious periods, and symptoms severity. These results can be the basis for testing alternative cropping systems and producing organic bananas.",

    "abstract": "Understory plant species take on different functional strategies, whereby some exploit periods of available light in springtime before the canopy closes, and others also benefit from sunlight later in autumn when the canopy opens again. These strategies involve understory species coordinating phenological events to pre-empt canopy leaf out and to extend their growing season beyond canopy leaf senescence, meanwhile accumulating photo-protective pigments which mitigate periods of high-light exposure. Canopy closure brings shade to the understory, but also causes drastic changes in light quality. Whilst many experiments manipulating spectral quality have revealed understory plant responses to the changing R:FR ratio in shade, effect of the blue and UV regions have been examined very little. We installed filters attenuating short wavelength regions of the solar spectrum in a forest understory in southern Finland, creating the following treatments: a transparent control filter, and filters attenuating UV radiation < 350 nm, all UV radiation, and both UV and blue light. In eight understory species, representing different plant functional types, we repeatedly assessed leaf optical properties to obtain epidermal flavonol and anthocyanin contents from leaf emergence in spring to leaf senescence in autumn, during both 2017 and 2018. Flavonols responded more to seasonal changes in light quality in relatively light-demanding species than in shade-tolerant and wintergreen species; and were particularly responsive to blue light. However, anthocyanins were largely unaffected by our filter treatments, suggesting that other cues such as cold temperatures govern their seasonal variation. UV radiation only accelerated leaf senescence in Acer platanoides seedlings, but blue light accelerated leaf senescence in all species measured apart from Quercus robur. In summary, seasonal changes in understory solar radiation in the blue and UV regions affected leaf pigments and leaf phenology; particularly for more light-demanding species. An increase in canopy duration under climate change will extend the period of shade in the understory, with consequences for the spectral cues available to understory plants. The resultant reduction in blue and UV radiation in shade, could delay leaf senescence in the understory even further.",

Phylodynamic analyses performed using the coat protein gene of SCMoV isolates from sunflower and weeds dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) back to 1887 (HPD95% = 1572-1971), which coincides with the dates of sunflower introduction in Argentina.

    "abstract": "The ability to engineer the substrate specificity of natural aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs facilitates the site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. The Methanocaldococcus jannaschii derived tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (MjTyrRS)/tRNA pair has been engineered to incorporate numerous ncAAs into protein expressed in bacteria. However, it cannot be used in eukaryotic cells due to cross-reactivity with its host counterparts. The E. coli derived tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EcTyrRS)/tRNA pair offers a suitable alternative to this end, but a much smaller subset of ncAAs has been genetically encoded using this pair. Here we report that this discrepancy, at least partly, stems from the lower structural robustness of EcTyrRS relative to MjTyrRS. We show that engineered TyrRS mutants in general exhibit significantly lower thermostability relative to their wild-type counterparts. Derived from a thermophilic archaeon, MjTyrRS is a remarkably sturdy protein and tolerates extensive active site engineering without a catastrophic loss of stability at physiological temperature. In contrast, EcTyrRS exhibits significantly lower thermostability, rendering some of its engineered mutants insufficiently stable at physiological temperature. Our observations identify the structural robustness of an aaRS as an important factor that significantly influences how extensively it can be engineered. To overcome this limitation, we have further developed chimeras between EcTyrRS and its homolog from a thermophilic bacteria, which offer an optimal balance between thermostability and activity. We show that the chimeric bacterial TyrRSs show enhanced tolerance for destabilizing active site mutations, providing a potentially more engineerable platform for genetic code expansion.",

    "abstract": "The trimeric HIV-1 Envelope protein (Env) mediates viral-host cell fusion via a network of conformational transitions, with allosteric elements in each protomer orchestrating host receptor-induced exposure of the co-receptor binding site and fusion elements. To understand the molecular details of this allostery, we introduced Env mutations aimed to prevent CD4-induced rearrangements in the HIV-1 BG505 Env trimer. Binding analysis performed on the soluble ectodomain BG505 SOSIP Env trimers, cell-surface expressed BG505 full-length trimers and single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) performed on the full-length virion-bound Env confirmed that these mutations prevented CD4-induced transitions of the HIV-1 Env. Structural analysis by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy performed on the BG505 SOSIP mutant Env proteins revealed rearrangements in the gp120 topological layer contacts with gp41. Specifically, a conserved tryptophan at position 571 (W571) was displaced from its typical pocket at the interface of gp120 topological layers 1 and 2 by lysine 567, disrupting key gp120-gp41 contacts and rendering the Env insensitive to CD4 binding. Vector based analysis of closed Env SOSIP structures revealed the newly designed trimers exhibited a quaternary structure distinct from that typical of SOSIPs and residing near a cluster of Env trimers bound to vaccine-induced fusion peptide-directed antibodies (vFP Mabs). These results reveal the critical function of W571 as a conformational switch in Env allostery and receptor-mediated viral entry and provide insights on Env conformation that are relevant for vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a monosaccharide that plays an essential role in cellular signaling throughout the nucleocytoplasmic proteome of eukaryotic cells. Yet, the study of post-translational modifications like O-GlcNAc has been limited by the lack of strategies to induce O-GlcNAcylation on a target protein in cells. Here, we report a generalizable genetic strategy to induce O-GlcNAc to specific target proteins in cells using a nanobody as a proximity-directing agent fused to O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Fusion of a nanobody that recognizes GFP (nGFP) or a nanobody that recognizes the four-amino acid sequence EPEA (nEPEA) to OGT(4), a truncated form of OGT, yielded a nanobody-OGT(4) construct that selectively delivered O-GlcNAc to the target protein (e.g., JunB, cJun, Nup62) and reduced alteration of global O-GlcNAc levels in the cell. Quantitative chemical proteomics confirmed the selective increase in O-GlcNAc to the target protein by nanobody-OGT(4). Glycoproteomics revealed that nanobody-OGT(4) or full-length OGT produced a similar glycosite profile on the target protein. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to selectively target endogenous -synuclein for glycosylation in HEK293T cells. Thus, the use of nanobodies to redirect OGT substrate selection is a versatile strategy to induce glycosylation of desired target proteins in cells that will facilitate discovery of O-GlcNAc functions and provide a mechanism to engineer O-GlcNAc signaling. The proximity-directed OGT approach for protein-selective O-GlcNAcylation is readily translated to additional protein targets and nanobodies that may constitute a generalizable strategy to control post-translational modifications in cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNature uses post-translational modifications (PTMs) like glycosylation as a mechanism to alter protein signaling and function. However, the study of these modified proteins in cells is confined to loss-of-function strategies, such as mutagenic elimination of the modification site. Here, we report a generalizable strategy for induction of O-GlcNAc to a protein target in cells. The O-GlcNAc modification is installed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to thousands of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Fusion of a nanobody to OGT enables the selective increase of O-GlcNAc levels on a series of target proteins. The described approach will facilitate direct studies of O-GlcNAc and its regulatory enzymes and drive new approaches to engineer protein signaling via a strategy that may be conceptually translatable to additional PTMs.",

Due to the heterogeneity of cancers, precise information about the genomic composition of germline and malignant tissues has to be correlated with morphological, clinical and extrinsic features to advance medical knowledge and treatment options. With global differences in cancer frequencies and disease types, geographic data is of importance to understand the interplay between genetic ancestry and environmental influence in cancer incidence, progression and treatment outcome.\n\nIn this study, we analysed the current landscape of oncogenomic screening publications for geographic information content and quality, to address underrepresented study populations and thereby to fill prominent gaps in our understanding of interactions between somatic variations, population genetics and environmental factors in oncogenesis. We conclude that while the use of proxy derived geographic annotations can be useful for coarse-grained associations, the study of geo-correlated factors in cancer causation and progression will benefit from standardized geographic provenance annotations. Additionally, publication derived geographic provenance data allowed us to highlight stark inequality in the geographies of cancer genome profiling, with a near lack of sizeable studies from Africa and other large regions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic evaluation is a central component of a breeding program. In advanced economies, most genetic evaluations depend on large quantities of data that are recorded on commercial farms. Large herd sizes and widespread use of artificial insemination create strong genetic connectedness that enables the genetic and environmental effects of an individual animals phenotype to be accurately separated. In contrast to this, herds are neither large nor have strong genetic connectedness in smallholder dairy production systems of many low to middle-income countries (LMIC). This limits genetic evaluation, and furthermore, the pedigree information needed for traditional genetic evaluation is typically unavailable. Genomic information keeps track of shared haplotypes rather than shared relatives. This information could capture and strengthen genetic connectedness between herds and through this may enable genetic evaluations for LMIC smallholder dairy farms. The objective of this study was to use simulation to quantify the power of genomic information to enable genetic evaluation under such conditions.\\n\\nResultsThe results from this study show: (i) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows using genomic information had higher accuracy compared to pedigree information across all breeding designs; (ii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows with genomic information and modelling herd as a random effect had higher or equal accuracy compared to modelling herd as a fixed effect; (iii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows from breeding designs with strong genetic connectedness had higher accuracy compared to breeding designs with weaker genetic connectedness; (iv) genomic prediction of young bulls was possible using marker estimates from the genetic evaluations of their phenotyped dams. For example, the accuracy of genomic prediction of young bulls from an average herd size of 1 (=1.58) was 0.40 under a breeding design with 1,000 sires mated per generation and a training set of 8,000 phenotyped and genotyped cows.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of genomic information to be an enabling technology in LMIC smallholder dairy production systems by facilitating genetic evaluations with in-situ records collected from farms with herd sizes of four cows or less. Across a range of breeding designs, genomic data enabled accurate genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows and genomic prediction of young bulls using data sets that contained small herds with weak genetic connections. The use of smallholder dairy data in genetic evaluations would enable the establishment of breeding programs to improve in-situ germplasm and, if required, would enable the importation of the most suitable external germplasm. This could be individually tailored for each target environment. Together this would increase the productivity, profitability and sustainability of LMIC smallholder dairy production systems. However, data collection, including genomic data, is expensive and business models will need to be carefully constructed so that the costs are sustainably offset.",

This information could capture and strengthen genetic connectedness between herds and through this may enable genetic evaluations for LMIC smallholder dairy farms. The objective of this study was to use simulation to quantify the power of genomic information to enable genetic evaluation under such conditions.\\n\\nResultsThe results from this study show: (i) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows using genomic information had higher accuracy compared to pedigree information across all breeding designs; (ii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows with genomic information and modelling herd as a random effect had higher or equal accuracy compared to modelling herd as a fixed effect; (iii) the genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows from breeding designs with strong genetic connectedness had higher accuracy compared to breeding designs with weaker genetic connectedness; (iv) genomic prediction of young bulls was possible using marker estimates from the genetic evaluations of their phenotyped dams. For example, the accuracy of genomic prediction of young bulls from an average herd size of 1 (=1.58) was 0.40 under a breeding design with 1,000 sires mated per generation and a training set of 8,000 phenotyped and genotyped cows.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of genomic information to be an enabling technology in LMIC smallholder dairy production systems by facilitating genetic evaluations with in-situ records collected from farms with herd sizes of four cows or less. Across a range of breeding designs, genomic data enabled accurate genetic evaluation of phenotyped cows and genomic prediction of young bulls using data sets that contained small herds with weak genetic connections. The use of smallholder dairy data in genetic evaluations would enable the establishment of breeding programs to improve in-situ germplasm and, if required, would enable the importation of the most suitable external germplasm. This could be individually tailored for each target environment. Together this would increase the productivity, profitability and sustainability of LMIC smallholder dairy production systems. However, data collection, including genomic data, is expensive and business models will need to be carefully constructed so that the costs are sustainably offset.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear lamina is a proteinaceous network of filaments that provide both structural and gene regulatory functions by tethering proteins and large domains of DNA, so-called lamin associated domains (LADs), to the periphery of the nucleus. LADs are a large fraction of the mammalian genome that are repressed, in part, by their association to the nuclear periphery. The genesis and maintenance of LADs is poorly understood as are the proteins that participate in these functions. In an effort to identify proteins that reside at the nuclear periphery and potentially interact with LADs, we have taken a two-pronged approach. First, we have undertaken an interactome analysis of the inner nuclear membrane bound LAP2{beta} to further characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. To accomplish this, we have leveraged the BioID system, which previously has been successfully used to characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. Second, we have established a system to identify proteins that bind to LADs by developing a chromatin directed BioID system. We combined the BioID system with the m6A-tracer system which binds to LADs in live cells to identify both LAD proximal and nuclear lamina proteins. In combining these datasets, we have further characterized the protein network at the nuclear lamina, identified putative LAD proximal proteins and found several proteins that appear to interface with both micro-proteomes. Importantly, several proteins essential for LAD function, including heterochromatin regulating proteins related to H3K9 methylation, were identified in this study.",

    "abstract": "A successful acute inflammatory response results in the elimination of infectious agents by neutrophils and monocytes, followed by resolution and repair by tissue-resident and recruited macrophages. D-series resolvins are pro-resolving mediators involved in resolution and tissue repair, their intracellular signaling mechanism(s) are of interest. Here, we report that D-series resolvins activate phospholipase D (PLD), a ubiquitously expressed membrane lipase in modulating phagocyte functions. The mechanism for PLD-mediated actions of RvD5 in polarizing macrophages (M1-M2) was found to be two-pronged: (a) RvD5 inhibits post-transcriptional modifications, by miRs and 3exonulceases that process PLD2 mRNA, thus increasing PLD2 expression and activity; (b) RvD5 enhances PLD2-S6K signaling and Actin expression required for membrane expansion and efferocytosis. In addition, investigating RvD5s actions in second organ reflow injury, we found that RvD5 did not reduce lung neutrophil myeloperoxidase levels in PLD2-/- mice compared to WT and PLD1-/- mice, pointing to a unique role of PLD2 as the relevant isoform in RvD5-mediated resolution. These results demonstrate that RvD5-PLD2 are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions in vascular inflammation such as I/R injury and cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Successful rearing of fish in hatcheries is critical for conservation, recreational fishing, and commercial fishing through wild stock enhancements, and aquaculture production. Flow through (FT) hatcheries require more water than Recirculating-Aquaculture-Systems (RAS) which enable up to 99% of water to be recycled thus significantly reducing environmental impacts. Here, we evaluated the biological and physical microbiome interactions of the built environment of a hatchery from three Atl salmon hatcheries (RAS n=2, FT n=1). Six juvenile fish were sampled from tanks in each of the hatcheries for a total of 60 fish across 10 tanks. Water and tank side biofilm samples were collected from each of the tanks along with three salmon body sites (gill, skin, and digesta) to assess mucosal microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing. The water and tank biofilm had more microbial richness than fish mucus while skin and digesta from RAS fish had 2x the richness of FT fish. Body sites each had unique microbial communities (P<0.001) and were influenced by the various hatchery systems (P<0.001) with RAS systems more similar. Water and especially tank biofilm richness was positively correlated with skin and digesta richness. Strikingly, the gill, skin and digesta communities were more similar to the origin tank biofilm vs. all other experimental tanks suggesting that the tank biofilm has a direct influence on fish-associated microbial communities. The results from this study provide evidence for a link between the tank microbiome and the fish microbiome with the skin microbiome as an important intermediate.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAtlantic salmon, Salmo salar, is the most farmed marine fish worldwide with an annual production of 2,248 million metric tonnes in 2016. Salmon hatcheries are increasingly changing from flow through towards RAS design to accommodate more control over production along with improved environmental sustainability due to lower impacts on water consumption. To date, microbiome studies on hatcheries have focused either on the fish mucosal microbiota or the built environment microbiota, but have not combined the two to understand interactions. Our study evaluates how water and tank biofilm microbiota influences fish microbiota across three mucosal environments (gill, skin, and digesta). Results from this study highlight how the built environment is a unique source of microbes to colonize fish mucus and furthermore how this can influence the fish health. Further studies can use this knowledge to engineer built environments to modulate fish microbiota for a beneficial phenotype.",

Combining a cognitive-control task, functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested this hypothesis in the salience network of 20 first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 20 healthy control (HC) subjects. Across groups, glutamate concentration in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was associated with higher and lower inhibitory connectivity in the dACC and in the anterior insula (AI) respectively. Crucially, glutamate concentration correlated negatively with the inhibitory influence on the excitatory neuronal population in the dACC of FEP subjects. Furthermore, aberrant computational parameters of the cognitive-control task performance were associated with aberrant inhibitory connections. Finally, the strength of connections from the dACC to the AI correlated negatively with severity of social withdrawal.

    "abstract": "Domestication is anthropogenic evolution that fulfills mankinds critical food demand. As such, elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind this process promotes the development of future new food resources including crops. With the aim of understanding the long-term domestication process of Asian rice and by employing the Oryza sativa subspecies (indica and japonica) as an Asian rice domestication model, we scrutinized past genomic introgressions between them as traces of domestication. Here we show the genome-wide introgressive region (IR) map of Asian rice, by utilizing 4,587 accession genotypes with a stable outgroup species, particularly at the finest resolution through a machine learning-aided method. The IR map revealed that 14.2% of the rice genome consists of IRs, including both wide IRs (recent) and narrow IRs (ancient). This introgressive landscape with their time calibration indicates that introgression events happened in multiple genomic regions over multiple periods. From the correspondence between our wide IRs and the so-called selective sweep regions, we provide a definitive answer to a long-standing controversy over the evolutionary origin of Asian rice domestication, single or multiple origins: It heavily depends upon which regions you pay attention to, implying that wider genomic regions represent immediate short history of Asian rice domestication as a likely support to the single origin, while its ancient history is interspersed in narrower traces throughout the genome as a possible support to the multiple origin.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that brain activity following the offset of a stimulus during encoding contributes to long-term memory formation, however the exact mechanisms underlying offset-related encoding are still unclear. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate offset-related activity in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). rTMS was administered at different points in time around stimulus offset while male and female participants encoded visually-presented words (first rTMS experiment) or pairs of words (second rTMS experiment) and the analyses focused on the effects of the stimulation on subsequent memory performance. The results show that rTMS administered at the offset of the stimuli, but not during online encoding, disrupted subsequent memory performance. In the first experiment we show that rTMS specifically disrupted encoding mechanisms initiated by the offset of the stimuli rather than general, post-stimulus processes. In the second experiment, we show a robust decline in associative memory performance when rTMS was delivered at the offset of the word pairs, suggesting that offset-related encoding may contribute to the binding of information into an episodic memory trace. A meta-analysis conducted on the two studies and on a previously published dataset confirmed that the involvement of the left VLPFC in memory formation is initiated by the offset of the stimulus. The offset of the stimulus may represent an event boundary that promotes the reinstatement of the previously experienced event and episodic binding.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHow well an event is encoded predicts how well it is remembered, and verbal encoding is an important part of everyday memory that, if disrupted, can lead to difficulties and disorders. The timing of encoding processes relative to the presentation of an event is important for successful retrieval, and little is known about the interval immediately after an events presentation (post-stimulus offset) which is thought to involve critical encoding processes in the VLPFC and hippocampus. The current studies demonstrate that indeed, verbal encoding processes in the VLPFC that are necessary for memory formation are triggered by the offset of the word, and these processes may involve VLPFC-hippocampal interactions that promote binding of event features into a single, coherent memory trace.",

Using a high-throughput kinome screen combined with 3D invasion assays, we identified fibroblast-expressed PIK3C{delta} (f-PIK3C{delta}) as a key regulator of progression. Although PIK3C{delta} has been mainly described in leucocytes, we detected high expression in primary fibroblasts derived from TNBC patients, while PIK3C{delta} was undetectable in cancer epithelial cell lines. Genetic and pharmacologic gain- and loss-of functions experiments verified the contribution of f-PIK3C{delta} in TNBC cell invasion. By employing an integrated secretomics and transcriptomics analysis, we revealed a paracrine mechanism via which f-PIK3C{delta} confers its pro-tumorigenic effects. Inhibition of f-PIK3C{delta} promoted the secretion of factors, including PLGF and BDNF, which subsequently led to upregulation of NR4A1 in TNBC cells where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Inhibition of PIK3C{delta} in an orthotopic BC mouse model reduced tumor growth only after inoculation with fibroblasts, indicating a role of f-PIK3C{delta} in cancer progression. Similar results were observed in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic BC mouse model, in addition to a decrease on tumor metastasis emphasizing the potential immune-independent effects of PIK3C{delta} inhibition. Finally, analysis of BC patient cohorts and TCGA datasets identified f-PIK3C{delta} (protein and mRNA levels) as an independent prognostic factor for overall and disease free survival, highlighting it as a therapeutic target for TNBC.",

Here we show fundamental differences in the seeding patterns of lymphatic and distant metastases. Analyzing the reconstructed phylogenies of human colorectal cancers, we find that distant metastases typically are monophyletic, originating from one common ancestor. Lymphatic metastases, in contrast, are almost exclusively polyphyletic and can be seeded from many primary tumor regions. We develop a rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying the phylogenetic diversity of metastases while accounting for differential lesion sampling among patients. Our results indicate that a smaller fraction of primary tumor cells gives rise to distant metastases than lymphatic metastases. Thus, the two metastasis types exhibit profoundly distinct phylogenetic traits, indicating that different evolutionary mechanisms may drive their formation and influence their clinical behavior.",

Here, I analyse the effects of stocking by Japanese marine and salmon stock-enhancement programmes and evaluate their efficacy through a Bayesian meta-analysis of new and previously considered cases. The posterior mean recapture rate ({+/-} SD) was 8.3 {+/-} 4.7%. Without considering personnel costs and negative impacts on wild populations, the mean economic efficiency was 2.8 {+/-} 6.1, with many cases having values of 1 to 2. On the macro-scale, the proportion of released seeds to total catch was 76 {+/-} 20% for Japanese scallop, 28 {+/-} 10% for abalone, 20 {+/-} 5% for swimming crab, 13 {+/-} 5% for kuruma prawn, 11 {+/-} 4% for Japanese flounder, and 7 {+/-} 2% for red sea bream; according to these percentages, stocking effects were generally small, and population dynamics were unaffected by releases but dependent on the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. All cases of Japanese releases, except for Japanese scallop, were probably economically unprofitable. Captive breeding reduces the fitness of hatchery fish in the wild. In addition, long-term releases replace wild genes and may cause fitness decline in the recipient population when the proportion of hatchery fish is very high. Short-term hatchery stocking can be useful, particularly for conservation purposes, but large-scale programmes may harm the sustainability of populations. Nursery habitat recovery and fishing pressure reduction often outperform hatcheries in the long run.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in microbiome research is to learn what distinguishes a healthy from a dysbiotic microbial community. Shifts in diversity and taxonomic composition are important indicators of dysbiosis, but a full understanding also requires knowledge of absolute microbial population sizes. In addition to the number of microbial cells, information on taxonomic composition can provide important insight into microbiome function and disease state. Here we use shotgun metagenomics to simultaneously assess microbiome composition and microbial load in the phyllosphere of wild populations of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that wild plants vary substantially in the load of colonizing microbes, and that high loads are typically associated with the proliferation of single taxa, with only a few putatively pathogenic taxa achieving high abundances in the field. Our results suggest (i) that the inside of a plant leaf is on average sparsely colonized with an estimated two bacterial genomes per plant genome and an order of magnitude fewer eukaryotic microbial genomes, and (ii) that higher levels of microbial cells often indicate successful colonization by pathogens. Lastly, our results show that load is a significant explanatory variable for loss of estimated Shannon diversity in phyllosphere microbiomes, implying that reduced diversity may be a significant predictor of microbial dysbiosis in a plant leaf.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) facilitate long-distance delivery of virulence factors crucial for pathogenicity. The entry and trafficking mechanisms of virulence factors inside host cells is recently emerging, however, if bacterial MVs modulate the physicochemical properties of the host lipid membrane remains unknown. Here we reconstitute the interaction of bacterial MV with host cell lipid membranes and quantitatively show that bacterial MV interaction increases the fluidity, dipole potential and elasticity of a biologically relevant multi-component host membrane. The presence of cylindrical lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol and a moderate acyl chain length of C16 helps the MV interaction. While significant binding of bacterial MVs to the raft-like lipid membranes with phase separated regions of the membrane was observed, however, MVs have a preference for binding to the liquid disordered regions of the membrane. Further, the elevated levels of cholesterol tend to hinder the interaction of bacterial MVs. We further quantify the change in excess Gibbs free energy of mixing of bacterial MVs with host lipid membranes driving the modulation of host membrane parameters. The findings may have significant implications on the regulation of host machineries by pathogen through manipulation of host membrane properties.\n\nSignificance StatementBacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) act as the long-distance delivery tools for virulence factor and thus, directly implicated in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenicity. While the mechanisms of virulence transfer is only recently emerging, however, the interaction of MVs the host cell membrane remains largely unexplored. Whether the MVs interaction can locally modulate the host lipid membrane physicochemical properties (such as fluidity, dipole potential and elasticity) remains unknown. Here, we quantitatively investigate the lipid specificity of E. Coli MV interaction and this results in increase in the fluidity, dipole potential and in-plane elasticity of a biologically relevant multi-component host membrane. The findings could be important for numerous cell-signaling processes as well as downstream events involving membrane-membrane fusion during process of phagosome maturation.",

    "abstract": "Genetic stock identification (GSI) is a major management tool of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus Spp.) that has provided rich genetic baseline data of allozymes, microsatellites, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the Pacific Rim. Here, we analyzed published data sets for adult chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), namely 10 microsatellites, 53 SNPs, and a mitochondrial DNA locus (mtDNA3, control region and NADH-3 combined) from 495 locations in the same distribution range (n = 61,813). TreeMix analysis of the microsatellite loci identified the highest level of genetic drift towards Japanese/Korean populations and suggested two admixture events from Japan/Korea to Russia and the Alaskan Peninsula. The SNPs had been purposively collected from rapidly evolving genes to increase the power of GSI. The highest expected heterozygosity was observed in Japanese/Korean populations for microsatellites, whereas it was highest in Western Alaskan populations for SNPs, reflecting the SNP discovery process. By regressing the SNP population structures on those of the microsatellites, we estimated the selection on the SNP loci according to deviations from the predicted structures. Specifically, we matched the sampling locations of the SNPs with those of the microsatellites according to geographical information and performed regression analyses of SNP allele frequencies on the two coordinates of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) of matched locations obtained from microsatellite pairwise FST values. The MDS first axis indicated a latitudinal cline in American and Russian populations, whereas the second axis found a differentiation of Japanese/Korean populations. The top five outlier SNPs were mtDNA3 (combined locus of the control region and NADH-3), U502241 (unknown), GnRH373, ras1362, and TCP178, which were consistently identified by principal component analysis. We summarized the functions of the 53 nuclear SNPs and mtDNA3 locus by referring to a gene database system and discussed the functions of the outlier SNPs and fitness of chum salmon.",

    "abstract": "The MCM2-7 (minichromosome maintenance) protein complex is a DNA unwinding motor required for the eukaryotic genome duplication1. Although a huge excess of MCM2-7 is loaded onto chromatin in G1 phase to form pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs), only 5-10 percent are converted into a productive CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase in S phase - a perplexing phenomenon often referred to as the  MCM paradox2. Remaining pre-RCs stay dormant but can be activated under replication stress (RS)3. Remarkably, even a mild reduction in MCM pool results in genome instability4, 5, underscoring the critical requirement for high-level MCM maintenance to safeguard genome integrity across generations of dividing cells. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we show that for daughter cells to sustain error-free DNA replication, their mothers build up a stable nuclear pool of MCMs both by recycling of chromatin-bound MCMs (referred to as parental pool) and synthesizing new MCMs (referred to as nascent pool). We find that MCMBP, a distant MCM paralog6, ensures the influx of nascent MCMs to the declining recycled pool, and thereby sustains critical levels of MCMs. MCMBP promotes nuclear translocation of nascent MCM3-7 (but not MCM2), which averts accelerated MCM proteolysis in the cytoplasm, and thereby fosters assembly of licensing-competent nascent MCM2-7 units. Consequently, lack of MCMBP leads to reduction of nascent MCM3-7 subunits in mother cells, which translates to poor MCM inheritance and grossly reduced pre-RCs formation in daughter cells. Unexpectedly, whereas the pre-RC paucity caused by MCMBP deficiency does not alter the overall bulk DNA synthesis, it escalates the speed and asymmetry of individual replisomes. This in turn increases endogenous replication stress and renders cells hypersensitive to replication perturbations. Thus, we propose that surplus of MCMs is required to safeguard replicating genomes by modulating physiological dynamics of fork progression through chromatin marked by licensed but inactive MCM2-7 complexes.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito borne flaviviruses cause a series of important diseases in humans and animals. These viruses are maintained in cycles involving replication in mosquito and in vertebrate hosts. Most natural hosts are vertebrate animals living in sylvatic or peridomestic environments. Human contact with these environments may result in host shifts that lead to the establishment of urban transmission cycles. Zika virus is a Flavivirus that persists in nature in a transmission cycle involving non-human primates (NHP). Its recent emergence in Brazil has shed light upon the importance of surveying this agent in Brazilian sylvatic environments. Here we present histopathological and molecular evidence that free ranging howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba) in Southern Brazil are infected by ZIKV closely related to African lineage MR766. Nine NHP were nested RT-PCR positive for ZIKV RNA. Sequence analysis revealed 96 to 98% identity to ZIKV MR766 and 85% identity to ZIKV P6-740, the current epidemic strain. The affected howler monkeys presented discrete inflammatory infiltrates in several tissues and immunohistochemichal (IHC) labeling of viral antigen was observed in placenta. These findings point to the circulation of African lineage Zika virus in the Americas in non-human primates. And raises the possibility that ZIKV was introduced into the Americas on more than one occasion.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) is known to engage motor networks and could compensate for the maladaptive neuroplasticity elicited by immobilization. This hypothesis and associated underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we investigated how MI practice during 11 h of arm-immobilization influences sensorimotor and cortical representations of the hands, as well as sleep. Fourteen participants were first tested after a normal day, followed by two 11-h periods of immobilization, either with concomitant MI treatment or control tasks. Data revealed that MI prevented the consequences of immobilization: (i) alteration of the sensorimotor representation of hands, (ii) decrease of cortical excitability over the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to arm-immobilization, and (iii) reduction of sleep spindles over both M1s. Furthermore, (iv) the time spent in REM sleep was significantly longer after MI. These results support that implementing MI during immobilization can limit the deleterious effects of limb disuse, at several levels of sensorimotor functioning.",

    "abstract": "Economic and decision-making theories suppose that people would disengage from a task with near zero success probability, because this implicates little normative utility values. However, humans are often motivated for an extremely challenging task, even without any extrinsic incentives. The current study aimed to address the nature of this challenge-based motivation and its neural correlates. We found that, when participants played a skill-based task without extrinsic incentives, their task enjoyment increased as the chance of success decreased, even if the task was almost impossible to achieve. However, such challenge-based motivation was not observed when participants were rewarded for the task or the reward was determined in a probabilistic manner. The activation in the ventral striatum/pallidum tracked the pattern of task enjoyment. These results suggest that people are intrinsically motivated to challenge a nearly impossible task, but only when the task requires certain skills and extrinsic rewards are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory complexes assemble into different forms of supercomplexes (SC). In particular, SC III2+IV require the SCAF1 protein. However, the structural role of this factor in the formation of the respirasome (I+III2+IV) and the physiological role of SCs are controversial. Here, we study C57BL/6J mice harbouring either non-functional SCAF1, the full knock-out for SCAF1 or the wild-type version of the protein and found a growth and exercise phenotype due to the lack of functional SCAF1. By combining quantitative data-independent proteomics, high resolution 2D Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis and functional analysis of enriched respirasome fractions, we show that SCAF1 confers structural attachment between III2 and IV within the respirasome, increases NADH-dependent respiration and reduces ROS production. Furthermore, through the expression of AOX in cells and mice we confirm that CI-CIII superassembly segments the CoQ in two pools and modulates CI-NADH oxidative capacity. These data demonstrate that SC assembly, regulated by SCAF1, modulates the functionality of the electron transport chain.",

    "abstract": "Every living cell is composed of macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, RNA and pigments. The ratio between these macromolecular pools depends on the allocation of resources within the organism to different physiological requirements, and in turn affects biogeochemical cycles of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, we present detailed measurements of the macromolecular composition of Prochlorococcus MIT9312, a representative strain of a globally abundant marine primary producer, as it grows and declines due to nitrogen starvation in laboratory batch cultures. As cells reached stationary stage and declined, protein per cell decreased by [~]30% whereas RNA per cell and pigments per cell decreased by [~]75%. The decline stage was associated with the appearance of chlorotic cells which had higher forward scatter (a proxy for cell size) but lower chlorophyll autofluorescence, as well as with changes in photosynthetic pigment composition. Specifically, during culture decline divinyl-chlorophyll-like pigments emerged, which were not observed during exponential growth. These divinyl-chlorophyll-like pigments were also observed in natural samples from the Eastern Mediterranean. Around >80% of the carbon fixed by Prochlorococcus MIT9312 (but not of a different strain, NATL2A) was released into the growth media as dissolved organic carbon under these laboratory conditions. Variations in RNA/protein indicate that, broadly defined, the macromolecular composition of Prochlorococcus MIT9312 is more similar to eukaryotic phytoplankton than to marine heterotrophic bacteria, possibly due to the significant investment in photosynthetic machinery of phototrophs.",
