    "abstract": "The human retromer is a stable heterotrimer of VPS35, VPS29 and VPS26 whose principal role is to orchestrate the endosomal retrieval of hundreds of internalised cargo and promote their recycling to the cell surface; a prototypical cargo being the glucose transporter GLUT1. Retromers role in a distinct endosomal retrieval pathway, the retrograde sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), remains controversial. Here we have developed and applied knocksideways to acutely inactivate retromer and by visualising the sorting of endogenous GLUT1 and CI-MPR provide insight into the temporal dynamics of endosomal cargo sorting in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells. While retromer knocksideways led to the development of time-resolved defects in cell surface sorting of GLUT1 we failed to observe defects in the sorting of the CI-MPR. In contrast knocksideways of ESCPE-1, a key regulator of retrograde CI-MPR sorting, resulted in a time-resolved defect in CI-MPR sorting. Together these data provide independent evidence consistent with a comparatively limited role for retromer in ESCPE-1 dependent CI-MPR retrograde sorting in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells.",

    "abstract": "Clinical and genetic heterogeneity has been documented extensively in schizophrenia, a common behavioural disorder with heritability estimates of about 80%. Common and rare de novo variant based studies have provided notable evidence for the likely involvement of a range of pathways including glutamatergic, synaptic signalling and neurodevelopment. To complement these studies, we sequenced exomes of 11 multimember affected schizophrenia families from India. Variant prioritisation performed based on their rarity (MAF <0.01), shared presence among the affected individuals in the respective families and predicted deleterious nature, yielded a total of 785 inherited rare protein sequence altering variants in 743 genes among the 11 families. These showed an enrichment of genes involved in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton components, synaptic and neuron related ontologies and neurodevelopmental pathways, consistent with major etiological hypotheses. We also noted an overrepresentation of genes from previously reported gene sets with de novo protein sequence altering variants in schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability; FMRP target and loss of function intolerant genes. Furthermore, a minimum of five genes known to manifest behavioural/neurological and nervous system abnormalities in rodent models had deleterious variants in them shared among all affected individuals in each of the families. Majority of such variants segregated within and not across families providing strong suggestive evidence for the genetically heterogeneous nature of disease. More importantly, study findings unequivocally support the classical paradigm of cumulative contribution of multiple genes, notably with an apparent threshold effect for disease manifestation and offer a likely explanation for the unclear mode of inheritance in familial schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Most freshwater bacterial communities are characterized by a few dominant taxa, which are often ubiquitous across freshwater biomes worldwide. Our understanding of the genomic basis underlying this pattern is limited to a subset of taxa. Here, we investigated the genomic basis that enables Limnohabitans, a freshwater genus key in funneling carbon from primary producers to higher trophic levels, to achieve abundance and ubiquity. We reconstructed eight metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from this genus along broad environmental gradients existing in Lake Michigan, part of Earths largest surface freshwater system. De novo strain inference analysis resolved a total of 23 strains from these MAGs, which strongly partitioned into two habitat-specific clusters with co-occurring strains from different lineages. The largest number of strains belonged to the abundant LimB lineage, for which robust in situ strain-delineation had not previously been achieved. Our data show that temperature and nutrient levels may be two of the primary drivers of microdiversification within the Limnohabitans genus. Additionally, strains predominant in low and high phosphorus conditions had larger genomic divergence than strains abundant under different temperatures. Comparative genomics and gene expression analysis yielded evidence for the ability of LimB populations to exhibit cellular motility and chemotaxis, a phenotype not yet associated with cultured Limnohabitans strains. Our findings broaden historical marker gene-based surveys of Limnohabitans microdiversification, and provide in situ evidence of genome diversity and its functional implications across freshwater gradients.",

    "abstract": "The large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel is a critical regulator of neuronal action potential firing and follows two distinct trends in early postnatal development: an increase in total expression and a shift from the faster activating STREX isoform to the slower ZERO isoform. We analyzed the functional consequences of developmental trends in BK channel expression in hippocampal neurons isolated from neonatal rats aged one to seven days. Following overnight cultures, action potentials were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. This population of neurons undergoes a steady increase in excitability during this time and the effect of blockade of BK channel activity with 100 nM iberiotoxin, changes as the neurons mature. BK currents contribute significantly more to single action potentials in neurons of one-day old rats (with BK blockade extending action potential duration by 0.46{+/-}0.12 ms) than in those of seven-day old rats (with BK blockade extending action potential duration by 0.17{+/-}0.05 ms). BK currents also contribute consistently to maintain firing rates in neurons of one-day old rats throughout extended action potential firing; BK blockade evenly depresses action potentials frequency across action potential trains. In neurons from seven-day old rats, BK blockade initially increases firing frequency and then progressively decreases frequency as firing continues, ultimately depressing neuronal firing rates to a greater extent than in the neurons from one day old animals. These results are consistent with a transition from low expression of a fast activating BK isoform (STREX) to high expression of a slower activating isoform (ZERO).\n\nNew and NoteworthyThis work describes the early developmental trends of BK channel activity. Early developmental trends in expression of BK channels, both total expression and relative isoform expression, have been previously reported, but little work describes the effect of these changes in expression patterns on excitability. Here, we show that early changes in BK channel expression patterns lead to changes in the role of BK channels in determining the action potential waveform and neuronal excitability.",

    "abstract": "Optical nanoscale technologies often implement covalent or noncovalent strategies for the modification of nanoparticles, whereby both functionalizations are leveraged for multimodal applications but can affect the intrinsic fluorescence of nanoparticles. Specifically, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can enable real-time imaging and cellular delivery; however, the introduction of covalent SWCNT sidewall functionalizations often attenuates SWCNT fluorescence. Herein, we leverage recent advances in SWCNT covalent functionalization chemistries that preserve the SWCNTs pristine graphitic lattice and intrinsic fluorescence and demonstrate that such covalently functionalized SWCNTs maintain fluorescence-based molecular recognition of neurotransmitter and protein analytes. We show that the covalently modified SWCNT nanosensor fluorescence response towards its analyte is preserved for certain nanosensors, presumably dependent on the steric hindrance introduced by the covalent functionalization that hinders noncovalent interactions with the SWCNT surface. We further demonstrate that these SWCNT nanosensors can be functionalized via their covalent handles to self-assemble on passivated microscopy slides, and discuss future use of these dual-functionalized SWCNT materials for multiplexed applications.",

    "abstract": "Workflows for large-scale (MS)-based shotgun proteomics can potentially lead to costly errors in the form of incorrect peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). To improve robustness of these workflows, we have investigated the use of the precursor mass discrepancy (PMD) to detect and filter potentially false PSMs that have, nonetheless, a high confidence score. We identified and addressed three cases of unexpected bias in PMD results: time of acquisition within a LC-MS run, decoy PSMs, and length of peptide. We created a post-analysis Bayesian confidence measure based on score and PMD, called PMD-FDR. We tested PMD-FDR on four datasets across three types of MS-based proteomics projects: standard (single organism; reference database), proteogenomics (single organism; customized genomic-based database plus reference), and metaproteomics (microorganism community; customized conglomerate database). On a ground truth dataset and other representative data, PMD-FDR was able to detect 60-80% of likely incorrect PSMs (false-hits) while losing only 5% of correct PSMs (true-hits). PMD-FDR can also be used to evaluate data quality for results generated within different experimental PSM-generating workflows, assisting in method development. Going forward, PMD-FDR should provide detection of high-scoring but likely false-hits, aiding applications which rely heavily on accurate PSMs, such as proteogenomics and metaproteomics.",

    "abstract": "During homologous recombination, Rad51 forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA to promote DNA strand exchange. This filament binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), searches for homology, and promotes transfer of the complementary strand, producing a new heteroduplex. Strand exchange proceeds via two distinct three-strand intermediates, C1 and C2. C1 contains the intact donor dsDNA whereas C2 contains newly formed heteroduplex DNA. Here, we show that conserved DNA binding motifs, loop 1 (L1) and loop 2 (L2) in site I of Rad51, play distinct roles in this process. L1 is involved in formation of the C1 complex whereas L2 mediates the C1-C2 transition, producing the heteroduplex. Another DNA binding motif, site II, serves as the DNA entry position for initial Rad51 filament formation, as well as for second donor dsDNA incorporation. Our study provides a comprehensive molecular model for the catalytic process of strand exchange mediated by eukaryotic RecA family recombinases.",

    "abstract": "Most rewards in our lives require effort to obtain them. It is known that effort is seen by humans as carrying an intrinsic disutility which devalues the obtainable reward. Established models for effort discounting account for this by using participant-specific discounting parameters inferred from experiments. These parameters offer only a static glance into the bigger picture of effort exertion. The mechanism underlying the dynamic changes in a participants willingness to exert effort is still unclear and an active topic of research. Here, we modeled dynamic effort exertion as a consequence of effort- and probability-discounting mechanisms during goal reaching, sequential behavior. To do this, we developed a novel sequential decision-making task in which participants make binary choices to reach a minimum number of points. Importantly, the time points and circumstances of effort allocation are decided by participants according to their own preferences and not imposed directly by the task. Using the computational model to analyze participants choices, we show that the dynamics of effort exertion arise from a combination of changing task needs and forward planning. In other words, the interplay between a participants inferred discounting parameters is sufficient to explain the dynamic allocation of effort during goal reaching. Using formal model comparison, we also infer the forward-planning strategy used by participants. The model allows us to characterize a participants effort exertion in terms of only a few parameters. Moreover, the model can be adapted to a number of tasks used in establishing the neural underpinnings of forward-planning behavior and meta-control, allowing for the characterization of behavior in terms of model parameters.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of Alzheimers disease (AD) increases with age and is a significant cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. However, the metabolic perturbations behind the onset of AD remains unclear. In this study, we performed metabolite profiling in both brain (n = 109) and matching serum samples (n = 566) to identify differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with neuropathology and cognitive performance and to identify individuals at high risk of developing cognitive impairment. The abundances of six metabolites, GLCA, petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid as well as the DCA/CA ratio, along with the dysregulation scores of three metabolic pathways, primary bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed significant differences in diagnostic groups across both brain and serum (P-value < 0.05).Significant associations were observed between the levels of differential metabolites/pathways and cognitive performance, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaque burden. Metabolites abundances and personalized metabolic pathways scores were used to derive machine learning models that could be used to differentiate cognitively impaired persons from those without cognitive impairment (median of AUC = 0.772 for the metabolite level model; median of AUC = 0.731 for the pathway level model). Utilizing these two models on the entire baseline control group, we identified those who experienced cognitive decline (AUC = 0.804, sensitivity = 0.722, specificity = 0.749 for the metabolite level model; AUC = 0.778, sensitivity = 0.633, specificity = 0.825 for the pathway level model) and demonstrated their pre-AD onset prediction potentials. Our study provides a proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate antecedent cognitive impairment in older adults before the onset of overt clinical symptoms using metabolomics. Our findings, if validated in future studies, could enable the earlier detection and intervention of cognitive impairment that may halt its progression.",

A number of available algorithms can help search these datasets to uncover patterns associated with specific traits, including disease-related attributes. While, in many instances, treating an algorithm as a black box is sufficient, it is interesting to pursue an enhanced understanding of how system variables end up contributing to a specific output, as an avenue towards new mechanistic insight. Here we address this challenge through a suite of algorithms, named BowSaw, which takes advantage of the structure of a trained random forest algorithm to identify combinations of variables (\"rules\") frequently used for classification. We first apply BowSaw to a simulated dataset, and show that the algorithm can accurately recover the sets of variables used to generate the phenotypes through complex Boolean rules, even under challenging noise levels. We next apply our method to data from the integrative Human Microbiome Project and find previously unreported high-order combinations of microbial taxa putatively associated with Crohns disease. By leveraging the structure of trees within a random forest, BowSaw provides a new way of using decision trees to generate testable biological hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) experiments uses stable isotope tracers to provide superior mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics datasets for metabolic flux analysis and metabolic modeling. Several software packages exist for metabolic flux analysis when provided a metabolic model and appropriate isotopomer and/or isotopologue datasets, mostly from 13C tracer time series experiments. However, assumptions of model correctness can seriously compromise interpretation of metabolic flux results generated from these packages. Therefore, we have developed a metabolic modeling software package specifically designed for moiety model comparison and selection based on the metabolomics data provided. This moiety modeling framework facilitates analysis of time-series SIRM MS isotopologue profiles using a set of plausible moiety models and data in a JSONized representation. The moiety_modeling Python package is available on GitHub and the Python Package Index and provides facilities for model parameter optimization, analysis of optimization results, and model selection. Furthermore, this package is capable of analyzing multi-tracer datasets. Here, we tested the effectiveness of this moiety modeling framework in model selection with two sets of time-series MS isotopologue datasets for uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) generated from different MS platforms: direct infusion nanoelectrospray Fourier transform MS and liquid chromatography MS. Results generated from the analyses of these datasets demonstrate the robustness of our model selection methods by the successful selection of the optimal model from over 40 models provided. Also, the effects of specific optimization methods, degree of optimization, selection criteria, and specific objective functions on model selection are illustrated. Furthermore, different types of error can exist in the datasets, and proper selection of the objective function can help reduce the optimization side effects caused by the specific types of uncertainty in these datasets. Overall, these results indicate that over-optimization can lead to failure in model selection, but combining multiple datasets can help prevent this overfitting effect. The implication is that SIRM datasets in public repositories of reasonable quality can be combined with newly acquired datasets to improve model selection. Furthermore, curation efforts of public metabolomics repositories to maintain high data quality could have huge impacts on future metabolic modeling efforts.",

After exposure of the rat serotonergic cell line RN46A to VPA, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed widespread changes in gene expression. Analysis by multiple pipelines revealed as many as 230 genes were significantly upregulated and 72 genes were significantly downregulated. A subset of 23 differentially expressed genes was selected for validation using the nCounter(R) platform, and of these we obtained robust validation for ADAM23, LSP1, MAOB, MMP13, PAK3, SERPINB2, SNAP91, WNT6, and ZCCHC12. We investigated the effect of lithium on this subset and found four genes, CDKN1C, LSP1, SERPINB2 and WNT6 co-regulated by lithium and VPA. We also explored the effects of other HDAC inhibitors and the VPA analogue valpromide on the subset of 23 selected genes. Expression of eight of these genes, CDKN1C, MAOB, MMP13, NGFR, SHANK3, VGF, WNT6 and ZCCHC12, was modified by HDAC inhibition, whereas others did not appear to respond to several HDAC inhibitors tested. These results suggest VPA may regulate genes through both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms. Understanding the broader gene regulatory effects of VPA in this serotonergic cell model should provide insights into how this drug works and whether other HDACi compounds may have similar gene regulatory effects, as well as highlighting molecular processes that may underlie regulation of mood.",

    "abstract": "Privacy concerns for rare disease data, institutional or IRB policies, access to local computational or storage resources or download capabilities are among the reasons that may preclude analyses that pool data to a single site. A growing number of multi-site projects and consortia were formed to function in the federated environment to conduct productive research under constraints of this kind. In this scenario, a quality control tool that visualizes decentralized data in its entirety via global aggregation of local computations is especially important, as it would allow the screening of samples that cannot be jointly evaluated otherwise. To solve this issue, we present two algorithms: decentralized data stochastic neighbor embedding, dSNE, and its differentially private counterpart, DP-dSNE. We leverage publicly available datasets to simultaneously map data samples located at different sites according to their similarities. Even though the data never leaves the individual sites, dSNE does not provide any formal privacy guarantees. To overcome that, we rely on differential privacy: a formal mathematical guarantee that protects individuals from being identified as contributors to a dataset. We implement DP-dSNE with AdaCliP, a method recently proposed to add less noise to the gradients per iteration. We introduce metrics for measuring the embedding quality and validate our algorithms on these metrics against their centralized counterpart on two toy datasets. Our validation on six multi-site neuroimaging datasets shows promising results for the quality control tasks of visualization and outlier detection, highlighting the potential of our private, decentralized visualization approach.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue pediatric sarcoma. Treatment options remain limited, presenting an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Using a high-throughput siRNA screen against the human kinome, we identified GRK5, a G-protein receptor kinase, as a novel regulator of RMS tumor cell growth and self-renewal. Through functional assays in vitro and in vivo, we show that GRK5 regulates cell cycling in a kinase-independent manner to promote RMS tumor cell growth. GRK5 interacts with NFAT to facilitate autoregulation of NFAT1 expression in a kinase independent manner, and loss of NFAT1 phenocopies GRK5 loss-of-function effects on cell cycle arrest. Self-renewal of RMS, required for recapitulation of tumor heterogeneity, is significantly reduced with loss of GRK5 due to increased cell death. Treatment of human RMS xenografts in mice with CCG-215022, a GRK5-selective inhibitor, reduces tumor growth of RMS. GRK5 represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS.\n\nStatement of SignificanceGRK5 promotes growth and self-renewal of RMS, thereby representing a novel therapeutic target for improving survival outcomes of RMS patients. GRK5 regulates RMS tumor cell growth in a kinase-independent manner through direct interaction with NFAT1. This finding promises novel drug design, targeting non-kinase domains of GRK5.",

    "abstract": "Temporally spaced genetic data allow for more accurate inference of population genetic parameters and hypothesis testing on the recent action of natural selection. In this work, we develop a novel likelihood-based method for jointly estimating selection coefficient and allele age from time series data of allele frequencies. Our approach is based on a hidden Markov model where the underlying process is a Wright-Fisher diffusion conditioned to survive until the time of the most recent sample. This formulation circumvents the assumption required in existing methods that the allele is created by mutation at a certain low frequency. We calculate the likelihood by numerically solving the resulting Kolmogorov backward equation backwards in time while re-weighting the solution with the emission probabilities of the observation at each sampling time point. This procedure reduces the two-dimensional numerical search for the maximum of the likelihood surface for both the selection coefficient and the allele age to a one-dimensional search over the selection coefficient only. We illustrate through extensive simulations that our method can produce accurate estimates of the selection coefficient and the allele age under both constant and non-constant demographic histories. We apply our approach to re-analyse ancient DNA data associated with horse base coat colours. We find that ignoring demographic histories or grouping raw samples can significantly bias the inference results.",

How complex interactions of genetic, environmental factors and aging jointly contribute to dopaminergic degeneration in PD is largely unclear. Here, we applied frequent gene co-expression analysis on human patient substantia nigra-specific microarray datasets to identify potential novel disease-related genes. In vivo Drosophila studies validated two of 32 candidate genes, a chromatin remodeling factor SMARCA4 and a biliverdin reductase BLVRA. Inhibition of SMARCA4 was able to prevent dopaminergic degeneration not only caused by overexpression of BLVRA but also in four most common Drosophila PD models. Mechanistically, aberrant SMARCA4 and BLVRA converged on elevated ERK-ETS activity, attenuation of which by either genetic or pharmacological manipulation effectively suppressed dopaminergic degeneration in vivo. Drug inhibition of MEK/ERK also mitigated mitochondrial defects in PD gene-deficient human cells. Our findings underscore the important role of epigenetic regulators and implicate a common signaling axis for therapeutic intervention in a broad range of aging-related disorders including PD.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts are crucial players in the activation of defensive hormonal responses during plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we show that a plant virus-encoded protein re-localizes from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts upon triggering plant defence, interfering with the chloroplast-dependent activation of anti-viral salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Strikingly, we have found that plant pathogens from different kingdoms seem to have convergently evolved to target chloroplasts and impair SA-dependent defences following an association with membranes, which is based on the co-existence of two subcellular targeting signals, an N-myristoylation site and a chloroplast transit peptide. This pattern is also present in plant proteins, at least one of which conversely activates SA defences from the chloroplast. Taken together, our results suggest that a pathway linking plasma membrane to chloroplasts and activating defence exists in plants, and that such pathway has been co-opted by plant pathogens during host-pathogen co-evolution to promote virulence through suppression of SA responses.",

    "abstract": "The plant immune system relies on both cell-surface and intracellular NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) receptors. NLRs respond to pathogen effectors and activate effector-triggered immunity: a cocktail of responses, often accompanied by cell death, resulting in resistance.\n\nRPW8 encodes an unusual non-NLR Resistance (R) protein and confers broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance. It requires genetic components also required by some NLRs, resembles the HeLo-containing protein MLKL (necroptosis executor in animals) and HET-S (cell death executor in fungi) and is targeted to the extra-haustorial membrane during powdery mildew infection by its N-terminal non-cleaved signal anchor domain. RPW8 displays extensive recent duplication events in Arabidopsis and certain alleles can induce oligomerisation-dependent activation of the NLR RPP7.\n\nAll these features enabled us to formulate hypotheses for RPW8 function: (1) RPW8 could be a cell death executor for defence against pathogens. (2) RPW8 could be a decoy for effector targets.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we generated a quadruple knock-out mutant of the four RPW8-homologous copies in Arabidopsis Col-0, using CRISPR. The mutant still displays cell death upon activation of four well-characterised NLRs. However, it is partially impaired in powdery mildew resistance and also in bacterial resistance. Interestingly Col-0_rpw8 is delayed in flowering transition. In conclusion, RPW8 plays a broad role in immunity and plant development, beyond resistance to powdery mildew. There is no evidence that it is involved in executing ETI-associated cell death.",

    "abstract": "Selecting goals and successfully pursuing them in an uncertain and dynamic environment is an important aspect of human behaviour. In order to decide which goal to pursue at what point in time, one has to evaluate the consequences of ones actions over future time steps by forward planning. However, when the goal is still temporally distant, detailed forward planning can be prohibitively costly. One way to select actions at minimal computational costs is to use heuristics. It is an open question how humans mix heuristics with forward planning to balance computational costs with goal reaching performance. To test a hypothesis about dynamic mixing of heuristics with forward planning, we used a novel stochastic sequential two-goal task. Comparing participants decisions with an optimal full planning agent, we found that at the early stages of goal-reaching sequences, in which both goals are temporally distant and planning complexity is high, on average 42% (SD = 19%) of participants choices deviated from the agents optimal choices. Only towards the end of the sequence, participants behaviour converged to near optimal performance. Subsequent model-based analyses showed that participants used heuristic preferences when the goal was temporally distant and switched to forward planning when the goal was close.\n\nAuthor summaryWhen we pursue our goals, there is often a moment when we recognize that we did not make the progress that we hoped for. What should we do now? Persevere to achieve the original goal, or switch to another goal? Two features of real-world goal pursuit make these decisions particularly complex. First, goals can lie far into an unpredictable future and second, there are many potential goals to pursue. When potential goals are temporally distant, human decision makers cannot use an exhaustive planning strategy, rendering simpler rules of thumb more appropriate. An important question is how humans adjust the rule of thumb approach once they get closer to the goal. We addressed this question using a novel sequential two-goal task and analysed the choice data using a computational model which arbitrates between a rule of thumb and accurate planning. We found that participants decision making progressively improved as the goal came closer and that this improvement was most likely caused by participants starting to plan ahead.",

Beamformer-reconstructed MEG time-series allowed a direct comparison of power in the source domain between 24 children (8.0 {+/-} 2.5 years, 17 males) and 24 adults (40.6 {+/-} 17.4 years, 16 males). Our results suggest that the redistribution of oscillatory power from lower to higher frequencies that is observed in childhood does not hold once the age-related changes in the aperiodic signal are controlled for. When estimating both the periodic and aperiodic components, we found that power increases with age in the beta band only, and that the 1/f signal is flattened in adults compared to children.

Measurement of antiviral drug levels provides objective adherence information that may help prevent adverse health outcomes. Gold standard drug-level measurement by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry is centralized, heavily instrumented, and expensive and is thus unsuitable and unavailable for routine use in clinical settings. We developed the REverse TranscrIptase Chain Termination (RESTRICT) assay as a rapid and accessible measurement of drug levels indicative of long-term adherence to PrEP and ART. The assay uses designer single stranded DNA templates and intercalating fluorescent dyes to measure complementary DNA (cDNA) formation by reverse transcriptase in the presence of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs. We developed a probabilistic model for the RESTRICT assay by calculating the likelihood of incorporation of inhibitors into cDNA as a function of the relative concentrations of inhibitors and nucleotides. We validated the model by carrying out the RESTRICT assay using aqueous solutions of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), a measure of long-term adherence to PrEP and ART. We used dilution in water as a simple sample preparation strategy to detect TFV-DP spiked into blood. The RESTRICT assay accurately distinguishes TFV-DP drug levels within the clinical range for adherence and has the potential to be a useful test to identify patients with poor adherence to ART and PrEP.",

Global climate change is causing changes in aboveground plant biomass and shifting species composition in the Arctic, but little is known about the response of moss microbiomes.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we studied the total and potentially active bacterial community associated with Racomitrium lanuginosum, in response to 20-year in situ warming in an Icelandic heathland. We evaluated the effect of warming and warming-induced shrub expansion on the moss bacterial community composition and diversity, nifH gene abundance and nitrogen-fixation rates.\nC_LIO_LIWarming changed both the total and the potentially active bacterial community structure, while litter abundance only affected the total bacterial community structure. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased, while the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria decreased. NifH gene abundance and nitrogen-fixation rates were negatively affected by litter and Betula nana abundance, respectively. We also found shifts in the potentially nitrogen-fixing community, with Nostoc decreasing and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs increasing in relative abundance. Our data suggests that the moss microbial community including the potentially nitrogen-fixing taxa is sensitive to future warming.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Long-term warming led to a shift in moss-associated bacterial community composition, while the abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitrogen-fixation rates were negatively affected by increased litter and Betula nana abundance respectively. Warming and increased shrub abundance as a result of warming can affect moss-associated bacterial communities and nitrogen fixation rates in tundra ecosystems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal simulations of movement can provide insights needed to help humans regain mobility after injuries and design robots that interact with humans. Here, we introduce Open-Sim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation but requires extensive technical expertise to implement. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves, allowing them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle the wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which are common in musculoskeletal models. To show Mocos abilities, we first solve for muscle activity that produces an observed walking motion while minimizing muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Then, we predict a squat-to-stand motion and optimize the stiffness of a passive assistive knee device. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand human and animal movement.",

The paralogous type 3 lysine acetyltransferases (KAT3) CBP and p300 are both essential during development, but their specific functions in nondividing differentiated cells remains unclear. Here, we show that when both proteins are simultaneously knocked-out in excitatory neurons of the adult brain, the mice express a rapidly progressing neurological phenotype associated with reduced dendritic complexity and electrical activity, the transcriptional shutdown of neuronal genes, and a dramatic loss of H3K27 acetylation and pro-neural transcription factor binding at neuronal enhancers. The neurons lacking both KAT3 rapidly acquire a molecularly undefined fate with no sign of dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation or death. Restoring CBP expression or lysine acetylation reestablished neuronal-specific transcription. Our experiments demonstrate that KAT3 proteins act as fate-keepers in excitatory neurons and other cell types by jointly safeguarding chromatin acetylation levels at cell type-specific enhancers throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide optimal conditions for the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In this work we describe the occurrence of antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms and their mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in the effluent of two urban WWTPs in Ireland. Effluent samples were collected from two WWTPs in Spring and Autumn of 2015 and 2016. The bacterial susceptibility patterns to 13 antibiotics were determined. The phenotypic tests were carried out to identify AmpC or extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The presence of ESBL genes were detected by PCR. Plasmids carrying ESBL genes were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 recipient and underwent plasmid replicon typing to identify incompatibility groups. More than 90% of isolated faecal coliforms were resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin, followed by tetracycline (up to 39.82%), ciprofloxacin (up to 31.42%) and trimethoprim (up to 37.61%). Faecal coliforms resistant to colistin and imipenem were detected in all effluent samples. Up to 53.98% of isolated faecal coliforms expressed a multi-drug resistance (MRD) phenotype. AmpC production was confirmed in 5.22% of isolates. The ESBL genes were confirmed for 11.84% of isolates (9.2% of isolates carried blaTEM, 1.4% blaSHV-12, 0.2% blaCTX-M-1 and 1% blaCTX-M-15). Plasmids extracted from 52 ESBL isolates were successfully transformed into recipient E. coli. The detected plasmid incompatibility groups included the IncF group, IncI1, IncHI1/2 and IncA/C. These results provide evidence that treated wastewater is polluted with ARB and MDR faecal coliforms and are sources of ESBL-producing, carbapenem and colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are an emerging environmental concern with a potential impact on human health. The results provide the evidence that treated wastewater is polluted with antibiotic resistant bacteria containing mobile resistance mechanisms of importance to clinical treatment of pathogens and multi-drug resistant (MDR) faecal coliforms. They are sources of relatively high proportions of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and include carbapenem and colistin resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The significance of this study is the identification of the role of WWTPs as a potential control point to reduce or stop the movement of ESBL, MDR and colistin resistant bacteria into the environment from further upstream sources, such as human or animal waste.",

Here, we measured saccade trajectory curvature following the presentation of visual, auditory, and audiovisual distractors in a double-step saccade task to investigate if this stability mechanism also accounts for localized sounds. We found that saccade trajectories systematically curved away from the position at which either a light or a sound was presented, suggesting that both modalities are represented in eye-centered oculomotor centers. Importantly, the same effect was observed when the distractor preceded the execution of the first saccade. These results suggest that oculomotor centers keep track of visual, auditory and audiovisual objects by remapping their eye-centered representations across saccades. Furthermore, they argue for the existence of a supra-modal map which keeps track of multi-sensory object locations across our movements to create an impression of space constancy.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous microbial communities ultimately control the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) that enters the natural environment through natural seeps or accidental oil spills, but the interactions among microbes and with their chemical environment during oil biodegradation are highly complex and poorly understood. Genome-resolved metagenomics have the potential to help in unraveling these complex interactions. However, the lack of a comprehensive database that integrates existing genomic/metagenomic data from oiled environments with physicochemical parameters known to regulate the fate of PHCs currently limits data analysis and interpretations. Here, we present a curated, comprehensive, and searchable database that documents microbial populations in oiled ecosystems on a global scale, along with underlying physicochemical data, geocoded via GIS to reveal geographic distribution patterns of the populations. Analysis of the ~2,000 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) available in the database revealed strong ecological niche specialization within habitats e.g., specialization to coastal sediments vs. water-column vs. deep-sea sediments. Over 95% of the recovered MAGs represented novel and uncultured species underscoring the limited representation of cultured organisms from oil-contaminated and oil reservoir ecosystems. The majority of MAGs linked to oiled ecosystems are members of the rare biosphere in non-oiled samples, except for the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) which appears to be primed for oil biodegradation. GROS should facilitate future work toward a more predictive understanding of the microbial taxa and their activities that control the fate of oil spills as well as serve as a model approach for building similar resources for additional environmental processes and omic data of interest.",

Studies in survivors of SAH show an association between persistent cognitive deficits and alterations in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). However, modalities commonly used to assess RSFC in humans, such as fMRI, have practical limitations in small animals. Therefore, we used non-invasive functional optical intrinsic signal imaging to determine the effect of SAH on measures of RSFC in mice at early (day 4), intermediate (1 month), and late (3 months) time points after prechiasmatic arterial blood injection. We assessed Morris water maze, open field test, Y-maze, and rotarod performance from approximately 2 weeks to 3 months after SAH induction. We found qualitative and quantitative differences in seed-based connectivity maps between sham and SAH mice. SAH reduced motor, retrosplenial and visual seed-based connectivity indices, which persisted in retrosplenial and visual cortex seeds at 3 months. Seed-to-seed connectivity analysis confirmed attenuation of correlation coefficients in SAH mice, which persisted in predominantly posterior network connections at later time points. Seed-independent global and interhemispheric indices of connectivity revealed decreased correlations following SAH for at least 1 month. SAH led to Morris water maze hidden platform and open field deficits at 2 weeks, and Y-maze deficits for at least 3 months, without altering rotarod performance. In conclusion, experimental SAH leads to early and persistent alterations both in hemodynamically-derived measures of RSFC and in cognitive performance.",

Eya was discovered in the fly Drosophila melanogaster in relation to its function in eye development, and the same function was later reported in other insects. Eya is also involved in insect oogenesis, although studies in this sense are limited to D. melanogaster, which has meroistic ovaries, and where eya mutations abolish gonad formation.\n\nIn the present work we studied the function of eya in the panoistic ovary of the cockroach Blattella germanica. We show that eya is essential for correct development of panoistic ovaries. In B. germanica, eya acts at different level and in a distinct way in the germarium and the vitellarium. In the germarium, eya contributes to maintain the correct number of somatic and germinal cells by regulating the expression of steroidogenic genes in the ovary. In the vitellarium, eya facilitates follicle cells proliferation and contributes to regulate the cell program, in the context of basal ovarian follicle maturation. Thus, eya-depleted females of B. germanica arrest the growth and maturation of basal ovarian follicles and become sterile.",

We constructed bacterial communities with different diversity traits and employed exoenzyme activities (EEAs) and total available carbon (TAC) from substrates as proxies of bacterial functioning to test the independent effects of these two aspects of biodiversity. We expected that metabolic diversity, but not phylogenetic diversity would be associated with greater ecological function. Phylogenetically relatedness should intensify species interactions and coexistence, therefore amplifying the influence of metabolic diversity. We examined the effects of each diversity treatment using linear models, while controlling for the other, and found that phylogenetic diversity strongly influenced community functioning, positively and negatively. Metabolic diversity, however, exhibited negative or non-significant relationships with community functioning. When controlling for different substrates, EEAs increased along with phylogenetic diversity but decreased with metabolic diversity. The strength of diversity effects was related to substrate chemistry and the molecular mechanisms associated with each substrates degradation. EEAs of phylogenetically similar groups were strongly affected by within-genus interactions. These results highlight the unique flexibility of microbial metabolic functions that must be considered in further ecological theory development.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder and characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A critical pathological factor in the seizure genesis is neuronal loss. However, mechanisms which lead to neuronal death remain elusive. Our present investigation depicted that ferroptosis, a recently discovered iron- and lipid peroxidation-dependent cell death, probably served as a mechanism in murine models of kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. And treatment with ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), liproxstatin-1 (Lipo-1) or deferoxamine (DFO) significantly suppressed seizure severity and frequency. Using gene expression profiling in HT22 cells after glutamate exposure (a validated ferroptotic cell death model), we identified lysyl oxidase (Lox) as a novel inducer of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, Lox promoted ferroptosis via activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)-dependent 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) phosphorylation at serine 663 residue signaling, subsequent leading to lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In a murine model of KA-induced seizure, we illustrated that administration of {beta}-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a specific Lox inhibitor, remarkably prevented seizure generation. Overall, these findings highlight Lox, a novel identified ferroptotic regulator in neurons, serves as a potential target for seizure-related disease including epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundActigraphy has received increasing attention in classifying rest-activity cycles. However, in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), actigraphy data may be considerably confounded by passive movements, such as nursing activities and therapies. Consequently, this study verified whether circadian rhythmicity is (still) visible in actigraphy data from patients with DOC after correcting for passive movements.\n\nMethodsWrist actigraphy was recorded over 7-8 consecutive days in patients with DOC (diagnosed with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome [UWS; n=19] and [exit] minimally conscious state [MCS/EMCS; n=11]). Presence and actions of clinical and research staff as well as visitors were indicated using a tablet in the patients room. Following removal and interpolation of passive movements, non-parametric rank-based tests were computed to identify differences between circadian parameters of uncorrected and corrected actigraphy data.\n\nResultsUncorrected actigraphy data overestimated the interdaily stability and intradaily variability of patients activity and underestimated the deviation from a circadian 24h rhythm. Only 5/30 (17%) patients deviated more than 1h from 24h in the uncorrected data, whereas this was the case for 17/30 (57%) patients in the corrected data. When contrasting diagnoses based on the corrected dataset, stronger circadian rhythms and higher activity levels were observed in MCS/EMCS as compared to UWS patients. Day-to-night differences in activity were evident for both patient groups.\n\nConclusionOur findings indicate that uncorrected actigraphy data overestimates the circadian rhythmicity of patients activity, as nursing activities, therapies, and visits by relatives follow a circadian pattern itself. Therefore, we suggest correcting actigraphy data from patients with reduced mobility.",

    "abstract": "The autophagy-initiating human ULK complex consists of the kinase ULK1/2, FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to map their mutual interactions. The N-terminal 640 residues (NTD) of FIP200 interact with the C-terminal IDR of ATG13. Mutations in these regions abolish their interaction. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) and multiangle light scattering showed that FIP200 is a dimer whilst a single molecule each of the other subunits is present. The FIP200 NTD is flexible in the absence of ATG13, but in its presence adopts the shape of the letter C ~20 nm across. The ULK1 EAT domain interacts loosely with the NTD dimer, while the ATG13-ATG101 HORMA dimer does not contact the NTD. Cryo-EM of the NTD dimer revealed a structure similarity to the scaffold domain of TBK1, suggesting an evolutionary similarity between the autophagy initiating TBK1 kinase and the ULK1 kinase complex.\n\nSummaryThe human ULK complex consists of ULK1/2, FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101. We found that the FIP200 N-terminal domain is a C-shaped dimer that binds directly to a single ATG13 molecule and serves as the organizing hub of the complex.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe genetic mechanisms involved in human diseases are fundamental in biomedical research. Several databases with curated associations between genes and diseases have emerged in the last decades. Although, due to the demanding and time consuming nature of manual curation of literature, they still lack large amounts of information. Current automatic approaches extract associations by considering each abstract or sentence independently. This approach could potentially lead to contradictions between individual cases. Therefore, there is a current need for automatic strategies that can provide a literature consensus of gene-disease associations, and are not prone to making contradictory predictions.\n\nResultsHere, we present GeDex, an effective and freely available automatic approach to extract consensus gene-disease associations from biomedical literature based on a predictive model trained with four simple features. As far as we know, it is the only system that reports a single consensus prediction from multiple sentences supporting the same association. We tested our approach on the curated fraction of DisGeNet (f-score 0.77) and validated it on a manually curated dataset, obtaining a competitive performance when compared to pre-existing methods (f-score 0.74). In addition, we effectively recovered associations from an article collection of chronic pulmonary diseases, and discovered that a large proportion is not reported in current databases. Our results demonstrate that GeDex, despite its simplicity, is a competitive tool that can successfully assist the curation of existing databases.\n\nAvailabilityGeDex is available at https://bitbucket.org/laigen/gedex/src/master/ and can be used as a docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/laigen/gedex\n\nContactcmendezc@ccg.unam.mx\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary material are available at bioRxiv online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene fusion events are a significant source of somatic variation across adult and pediatric cancers and are some of the most clinically-effective therapeutic targets, yet low consensus of RNA-Seq fusion prediction algorithms makes therapeutic prioritization difficult. In addition, events such as polymerase read-throughs, mis-mapping due to gene homology, and fusions occurring in healthy normal tissue require informed filtering, making it difficult for researchers and clinicians to rapidly discern gene fusions that might be true underlying oncogenic drivers of a tumor and in some cases, appropriate targets for therapy.\n\nResultsWe developed annoFuse, an R package, and shinyFuse, a companion web application, to annotate, prioritize, and explore biologically-relevant expressed gene fusions, downstream of fusion calling. We validated annoFuse using a random cohort of TCGA RNA-Seq samples (N = 160) and achieved a 96% sensitivity for retention of high-confidence fusions (N = 603). annoFuse uses FusionAnnotator annotations to filter non-oncogenic and/or artifactual fusions. Then, fusions are prioritized if previously reported in TCGA and/or fusions containing gene partners that are known oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, COSMIC genes, and/or transcription factors. We applied annoFuse to fusion calls from pediatric brain tumor RNA-Seq samples (N = 1,028) provided as part of the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) Project to determine recurrent fusions and recurrently-fused genes within different brain tumor histologies. annoFuse annotates protein domains using the PFAM database, assesses reciprocality, and annotates gene partners for kinase domain retention. As a standard function, reportFuse enables generation of a reproducible R Markdown report to summarize filtered fusions, visualize breakpoints and protein domains by transcript, and plot recurrent fusions within cohorts. Finally, we created shinyFuse for algorithm-agnostic interactive exploration and plotting of gene fusions.\n\nConclusionsannoFuse provides standardized filtering and annotation for gene fusion calls from STARFusion and Arriba by merging, filtering, and prioritizing putative oncogenic fusions across large cancer datasets, as demonstrated here with data from the OpenPBTA project. We are expanding the package to be widely-applicable to other fusion algorithms and expect annoFuse to provide researchers a method for rapidly evaluating, prioritizing, and translating fusion findings in patient tumors.",

    "abstract": "Studying the social behaviour of small or cryptic species often relies on constructing networks from sparse point-based observations of individuals (e.g. live trapping data). Such an approach assumes that individuals that have been asynchronously detected in the same trapping location will also be more likely to have interacted. However, there is very little guidance on how much data are required for making robust co-trapping networks. In this study, we propose that co-trapping networks broadly assume that co-trapping captures shared space use (and, subsequently, likelihood of interacting), and that it may be more parsimonious to directly model shared space use. We first use empirical data to highlight that characteristics of how animals use space can help us to establish new ways to model the potential for individuals to co-occur. We then show that a method that explicitly models individuals home ranges and subsequent overlap in space among individuals (spatial overlap networks) requires fewer data for inferring observed networks that are correlated with the true shared space use network (relative to co-trapping networks constructed from space sharing events). Further, we show that shared space use networks based on estimating spatial overlap are also more powerful for detecting biological effects present in the true shared space use network. Finally, we discuss when it is appropriate to make inferences about social interactions from shared space use. Our study confirms the potential for using sparse trapping data from cryptic species to address a range of important questions in ecology and evolution.\n\nSignificance statementCharacterising animal social networks requires repeated (co-)observations of individuals. Collecting sufficient data to characterise the connections among individuals represents a major challenge when studying cryptic organisms--such as small rodents. This study draws from existing spatial mark-recapture data to inspire an approach that constructs networks by estimating space use overlap (representing the potential for interactions) from observations of individuals in the same location (e.g. a trap). We then use simulations to demonstrate that the method provides consistently higher correlations between inferred (or observed) networks and the true underlying network compared to current approaches, and requires fewer observations to reach higher correlations. We further demonstrate that these improvements translate to greater network accuracy and to more power for statistical hypothesis testing.",

These novel plastic debris types have only recently been described for the first time from Madeira island (NE Atlantic Ocean) and the United Kingdom, respectively. While  plasticrusts are generated by sea waves smashing plastic debris against intertidal rocks,  pyroplastic derives from (un)deliberately burnt plastic waste. Using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we identified the  plasticrust material as polyethylene (PE) and the  pyroplastic material as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). These polymers are widely used in everyday products and, therefore, contribute heavily to plastic pollution in aquatic and terrestrial environments worldwide. Furthermore, our field surveys suggest that  plasticrust abundance is related to wave-exposure and that the  pyroplastic derived from beverage bottles which we frequently found along the Giglio coast. Overall, our findings corroborate the notion that  plasticrusts and  pyroplastic are common debris types in marine coastal habitats.",

    "abstract": "Photoautotrophic cyanobacteria have developed sophisticated light response systems to capture and utilize the energy and information of incident light [1]. Cyanobacteria-specific photoreceptors cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) are distantly related to more widespread phytochromes. CBCRs show the most diverse spectral properties among the naturally occurring photoreceptors, typified by a unique and prevailing blue/green light-absorbing variant [2-6]. However, where the CBCR-mediated  colorful signaling systems function in nature has been elusive. We previously reported that the three CBCRs SesA/B/C synthesize/degrade a bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) in response to blue/green light [6-8]. The cooperative action of SesA/B/C enables blue light-ON and green light-OFF regulation of the c-di-GMP-dependent cell aggregation of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus [8, 9]. Here, we report that SesA/B/C can serve as a physiological sensor of cell density. Because cyanobacterial cells show lower transmittance of blue light than green light, higher cell density gives more green light-enriched irradiance to cells. The cell density-dependent suppression of cell aggregation under blue/green-mixed light and white light conditions support this idea. Such a sensing mechanism may provide information about the cell position in cyanobacterial mats in hot springs, the natural habitat of Thermosynechococcus. This cell position-dependent SesA/B/C-mediated regulation of cellular sessility (aggregation) might be ecophysiologically essential for the reorganization and growth of phototrophic mats. We also report that the green light-induced dispersion of cell aggregates requires red light-driven photosynthesis. Blue/green CBCRs might work as shade detectors in a different niche than red/far-red phytochromes, which may be why CBCRs have evolved in cyanobacteria.",

By artificially inflating the sample size, pseudoreplication contributes to irreproducibility, and it is a pervasive problem in biological research. In some fields, more than half of published experiments have pseudoreplication - making it one of the biggest threats to inferential validity. Researchers may be reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods if their hypothesis is about the pseudoreplicates and not the genuine replicates; for example, when an intervention is applied to pregnant female rodents (genuine replicates) but the hypothesis is about the effect on the multiple offspring (pseudoreplicates). We propose using a Bayesian predictive approach, which enables researchers to make valid inferences about biological entities of interest, even if they are pseudoreplicates, and show the benefits of this approach using two in vivo data sets.",

Recent technological developments in global positioning system (GPS) devices have opened up new avenues for locating animals with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Likewise, advances in computing power have enabled new levels of data analyses with complex mathematical models to address unresolved problems in animal behaviour, such as the nature of group geometry and the impact of group-level interactions on individuals. Here, we present an information theory-based tool for the analysis of group behaviour. We illustrate its affordances with GPS data collected from a freely interacting pack of 15 Siberian huskies (Canis lupus familiaris). We found that individual freedom in movement decisions was limited to about 4%, while a subjects location could be predicted with 96% median accuracy by the locations of other group members, a pattern mediated by dominance, kin relations, sex, the relative time of the day and external events, such as feeding. We conclude that information theory-based approaches, coupled with state-of-the-art bio-logging technology, provide a powerful tool for future studies of animal social interactions beyond the dyadic level.",

Over 1.8 billion people live on these lands so responses that promote agency, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million km2 of land requiring conservation could be lost to intensive human land-uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, there is a seven-fold difference between the amount of habitat converted under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis.

Yet, the anatomical mechanisms that explain how it is involved in such a diverse array of functions remain incompletely understood. Here, we define a novel framework to test the hypothesis that changes in myeloarchitecture across the insular cortex explain how it can be involved in many different facets of cognitive function. Detailed intracortical profiling, performed across hundreds of insular locations on the basis of myelin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was compressed into a lower-dimensional space uncovering principal axes of myeloarchitectonic variation. Leveraging two datasets with different high-resolution MRI contrasts, we obtained robust support for two principal dimensions of insular myeloarchitectonic differentiation in vivo, one running from ventral anterior to posterior banks and one radiating from dorsal anterior towards both ventral anterior and posterior subregions. Analyses of post mortem 3D histological data showed that the antero-posterior axis was mirrored in cytoarchitectural markers, even when controlling for anatomical landmarks and sulco-gyral folding. Resting-state functional connectomics in the same individuals and ad hoc meta-analyses showed that myelin gradients in the insula constrained affiliation to macroscale intrinsic functional systems, showing differential shifts in functional network embedding across each myelin-derived gradient. Collectively, our findings offer a novel approach to capture structure-function interactions of a key node of the limbic system, and suggest a multidimensional structural basis underlying the diverse functional roles of the insula.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that perception depends on a largely-feedforward brain network. However, the discrepancy between (i) the latency of the corresponding feedforward responses (150-200 ms) and (ii) the time it takes human subjects to recognize brief images (often >500 ms) suggests that recurrent neuronal activity is critical to visual processing. Here, we use magneto-encephalography to localize, track and decode the feedforward and recurrent responses elicited by brief presentations of variably-ambiguous letters and digits. We first confirm that these stimuli trigger, within the first 200 ms, a feedforward response in the ventral and dorsal cortical pathways. The subsequent activity is distributed across temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices and leads to a slow and incremental cascade of representations culminating in action-specific motor signals. We introduce an analytical framework to show that these brain responses are best accounted for by a hierarchy of recurrent neural assemblies. An accumulation of computational delays across specific processing stages explains subjects reaction times. Finally, the slow convergence of neural representations towards perceptual categories is quickly followed by all-or-none motor decision signals. Together, these results show how recurrent processes generate, over extended time periods, a cascade of hierarchical decisions that ultimately predicts subjects perceptual reports.",

    "abstract": "When interpreting sequencing data from multiple spatial or longitudinal biopsies, detecting sample mix-ups is essential yet more difficult than in studies of germline variation. In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is frequently detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor, and in many cases, only somatic variants are reported. The disjoint genotype information that results hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of germline variants. To address this problem, we have developed somalier, which can operate directly on the alignments, so as not to require jointly-called germline variants. Instead, somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of biopsies and normal tissues can then be compared in under a second. This speed also makes it useful for checking relatedness in large cohorts of germline samples. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics. We introduce the tool and demonstrate its utility on a cohort of five glioma samples each with a normal, tumor, and cell-free DNA sample. Applying somalier to high-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project also identifies several related samples. Somalier can be applied to diverse sequencing data types and genome builds, and is freely available for academic use at github.com/brentp/somalier.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system of Drosophila is composed of diverse cell types with substantial homologies to various cell types of more complex species, including the human. Among all nervous system cell types, astrocyte-like glia (ALG) is necessary for the proper physiology and behavior of the fly and human. In this study, we exploited the gene expression profile of single cells in Drosophila optic lobe to identify the genes with specific expression pattern in each subtype glia. Through bioinformatics analysis of the data, a novel ALG-specific gene (here assigned as deathstar, des) was identified. Immunostaining of des in the central nervous system (CNS) showed its presence in specific regions of Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord, previously characterized as ALG cells. Consistent with the bioinformatics analysis, des-related signals were overlapped with the signals of the previously-reported ALG marker. At physiological level, RNAi-mediated suppression of des gene impeded the normal development of male flies without any effects on females. Cell type-specific expression of des RNAi showed that des affects locomotion behaviour and lifespan of D. melanogaster, in an ALG-specific manner. Taken together, we showed that bioinformatically identified ALG-specific gene deathstar play critical roles in development and physiology of Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "The dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR) enzyme contains two [4Fe-4S]- containing component proteins (BchL and BchNB) that assemble in an ATP-dependent fashion to coordinate electron transfer and reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide. Photosynthesis generates an oxygenic environment that is non-optimal for [Fe-S] clusters and we here present an elegant evolutionarily conserved mechanism in BchL to protect its [4Fe-4S] cluster. We present a crystal structure of BchL in the nucleotide-free form with an ordered N-terminus that shields the [4Fe-4S] cluster at the docking interface between BchL and BchNB. Amino acid substitutions that perturb the shielding of the [4Fe-4S] cluster produce an unstable, but hyper-active enzyme complex, suggesting a role for the N-terminus in both auto-inhibition and enzyme stability. Upon ATP binding, a patch of amino acids, Asp-Phe-Asp ( DFD patch), situated at the mouth of the BchL ATP-binding pocket promotes inter-subunit cross stabilization of the two subunits and relieves the auto-inhibition by the N-terminus. A linked BchL dimer with one defective ATP-binding site does not support substrate reduction, illustrating that nucleotide binding to both subunits is a prerequisite for the inter-subunit cross stabilization. We propose that ATP-binding produces a conformational compaction of the BchL homodimer leading to a release of the flexible N-terminus from blocking the [4Fe-4S] cluster and promotes complex formation with BchNB to drive electron transfer. The auto-inhibitive feature and release mechanism appear unique to DPOR and is not found in the structurally similar nitrogenase.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules play vital roles in many cellular processes. Visualising their dynamics in live cells at single-molecule resolution is essential to elucidate their role in RNA metabolism. RNA aptamers, such as Spinach and Mango, have recently emerged as a powerful background-free technology for live-cell RNA imaging due to their fluorogenic properties upon ligand binding. Here, we report a novel array of Mango II aptamers for RNA imaging in live and fixed cells with high contrast and single-molecule sensitivity. Direct comparison of Mango II and MS2-tdMCP-mCherry dual-labelled mRNAs show marked improvements in signal to noise ratio using the fluorogenic Mango aptamers. Using both coding ({beta}-actin mRNA) and long non-coding (NEAT1) RNAs, we show that the Mango array does not affect cellular localisation. Additionally, we can track single mRNAs for extended time periods, likely due to fluorophore exchange. This property makes the arrays readily compatible with structured illumination super-resolution microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the vertebrate brain comprises many steps ranging from the proliferation of progenitors to the differentiation and maturation of neurons. Although these processes are highly regulated, the landscape of transcriptional changes and progenitor identities underlying brain development are poorly characterized. Here, we describe the first developmental single-cell RNA-seq catalog of more than 200,000 zebrafish brain cells encompassing 12 stages from 12 hours post-fertilization to 15 days post-fertilization. We characterize known and novel gene markers for more than 800 clusters across these timepoints. Our results capture the temporal dynamics of multiple neurogenic waves from embryo to larva that expand neuronal diversity from [~]20 cell types at 12 hpf to [~]100 cell types at 15 dpf. We find that most embryonic neural progenitor states are transient and transcriptionally distinct from long-lasting neural progenitors of post-embryonic stages. Furthermore, we reconstruct cell specification trajectories for the retina and hypothalamus, and identify gene expression cascades and novel markers. Our analysis reveal that late-stage retinal neural progenitors transcriptionally overlap cell states observed in the embryo, while hypothalamic neural progenitors become progressively distinct with developmental time. These data provide the first comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic time course for vertebrate brain development and suggest distinct neurogenic regulatory paradigms between different stages and tissues.",

    "abstract": "During range expansion, invasive species can experience new thermal regimes. Differences between the thermal performance of local and invasive species can alter species interactions, including predator-prey interactions. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a known vector of several viral diseases of public health importance. It has successfully invaded many regions across the globe and currently threatens to invade regions of the UK where conditions would support seasonal activity. We assessed the functional response and predation efficiency (percentage of prey consumed) of the cyclopoid copepods Macrocyclops albidus and Megacyclops viridis from South East England, UK against newly-hatched French Ae. albopictus larvae across a relevant temperature range (15, 20, and 25{degrees}C). Predator-absent controls were included in all experiments to account for background prey mortality. We found that both M. albidus and M. viridis display type II functional response curves, and that both would therefore be suitable biocontrol agents in the event of an Ae. albopictus invasion in the UK. No significant effect of temperature on the predation interaction was detected by either type of analysis. However, the predation efficiency analysis did show differences due to predator species. The results suggest that M. viridis would be a superior predator against invasive Ae. albopictus larvae due to the larger size of this copepod species, relative to M. albidus. Our work highlights the importance of size relationships in predicting interactions between invading prey and local predators.",

    "abstract": "In nature plants are constantly challenged by simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses, and under conflicting stress scenarios prioritization of stress responses is required for plant survival. Calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK5 is a central hub in local and distal immune signaling, required for hormone salicylic acid (SA)-dependent immunity and pathogen resistance. Here we show that CPK5-dependent immune responses and pathogen resistance are inhibited upon abscisic acid (ABA) treatment or in genetic mutant backgrounds lacking PP2C phosphatase activities including abi1-2, whereas immune responses are enhanced by co-expression of active ABI1 phosphatase variants. Biochemical studies and mass spectrometry-based phospho-site analysis reveal a direct ABI1 phosphatase-catalyzed de-phosphorylation of CPK5 auto-phosphorylation site T98. Mimicking continuous de-phosphorylation in CPK5T98A leads to enhanced ROS production and more resistant plants, mimicking the auto-phosphorylated status in CPK5T98D, reduces CPK5-mediated immune responses. Mechanistic insight identifies differential phosphorylation at T98 in the N-terminal domain of CPK5 to control the level of interaction between the kinase and its substrate protein rather than CPK5 catalytic activity. Thus, CPK5-catalyzed immune signaling may become discontinued even at an elevated cytoplasmic calcium concentration.\n\nOur work reveals an elegant mechanism for stress response prioritization in plants: The ABA-dependent phosphatase ABI1, negative regulator of abiotic responses, functions as positive regulator of biotic stress responses, stabilizing CPK5-dependent immune signaling in the absence of ABA. Continuous pathogen survey activates plant immunity in environmentally friendly conditions, whereas under severe abiotic stress the phosphatase/kinase pair prohibits immune signaling through a direct biochemical switch involving two key regulatory enzymes of these antagonistic pathways.\n\nSignificance StatementPlants challenged by simultaneous abiotic and biotic stresses must prioritize in conflicting scenarios to guarantee survival. Pathogen resistance and immune memory depends on the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). Adaptation to abiotic stress signaling involves the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). We identify a direct biochemical switch by which ABA-mediated abiotic signaling prioritizes over SA-dependent immune responses via reversible phosphorylation at a single protein mark involving two key regulatory enzymes of these antagonistic pathways. Phosphatase ABI1 de-phosphorylates calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK5 at an auto-phosphorylation site T98, which effects the interaction efficiency between the kinase and its substrate. Under abiotic stress ABA mediates phosphatase inhibition, which facilitates prolonged auto-phosphorylation of CPK5, preventing CPK5 substrate interaction and ultimately stop CPK5-mediated immune signaling.",

    "abstract": "Understanding factors contributing to individual differences in vulnerability to opioid addiction is essential for developing more effective preventions and treatments, yet few reliable behavioral predictors of subsequent opioid self-administration have been identified in rodents. Sensitivity to the acute effects of initial drug exposure predicts later addiction vulnerability in both humans and animals, but the relationship of sensitivity to withdrawal from initial drug exposure and later drug use vulnerability is unclear. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether the degree of anhedonia experienced during withdrawal from early opioid exposure predicts subsequent vulnerability to opioid addiction. Rats were first tested for withdrawal sensitivity following acute injections of morphine (i.e., \"acute dependence\"), measured as elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds (anhedonia-like behavior) during naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal. Rats were then tested for addiction vulnerability using various measures of i.v. morphine self-administration (MSA) including acquisition, demand, extinction, and reinstatement induced by morphine, stress, and/or drug-associated cues. Greater naloxone-precipitated withdrawal across repeated morphine injections and greater peak spontaneous withdrawal severity following a single morphine injection were associated with lower addiction vulnerability on multiple MSA measures. Withdrawal-induced anhedonia predicted a wider range of MSA measures than did any individual measure of MSA itself. These data suggest that high anhedonia during withdrawal from initial opioid exposure is protective against subsequent opioid addiction vulnerability in rodents, thereby establishing one of the first behavioral measures to predict individual differences in opioid SA. This model promises to be useful for furthering our understanding of behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to opioid addiction.",

Our results showed that highest removal percentage of PHE and PYR in contaminated soil as well as biomass of tall fescue were observed in GVPS. PHE and PYR accumulation by tall fescue roots were higher than shoots, the mycorrhizal status was best manifested in the roots of tall fescue inoculated with GVPS, and GVPS significantly increased the number of PGPR colonization in tall fescue rhizosphere soil. And paired-end Illumina HiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene amplicons were also employed to study change of bacterial and fungal communities structure in four treatments. GVPS positively affected the speices and abundance of bacteria and fungi in PHE and PYR contaminated soil, an average of 71,144 high quality bacterial 16S rDNA tags and 102,455 ITS tags were obtained in GVPS, and all of them were assigned to 6,327 and 825 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum in all treatments, whereas Proteobacteria and Glomeromycota were the most prevalent bacterial and fungal phyla in GVPS, respectively. And in the generic level, Planctomyces is the richest bacterial genus, and Meyerozyma is the richest fungal genus in all treatments, whereas Sphingomona was the dominant bacterial genus, while the dominant fungi was Fusarium in GVPS. Overall, our findings revealed that application of AMF and PGPR had an effective role in improving the growth characteristics, root colonization of F. elata and soil microbial community structure in PHE and PYR contaminated soils, but no obvious in degradation efficiencies of PAHs as compared to the control.",

    "abstract": "Local flow dynamics play a central role in physiological processes like respiration and nutrient uptake in coral reefs. Despite the importance of corals as hosts to a quarter of all marine life, and the pervasive threats currently facing corals, little is known about the detailed hydrodynamics of branching coral colonies. Here, in order to investigate the effects of the colony branch density and surface roughness on the local flow field, three-dimensional simulations were performed using immersed boundary, large-eddy simulations for four different colony geometries under low and high unidirectional oncoming flow conditions. The first two colonies were from the Pocillopora genus, one with a densely branched geometry, and one with a comparatively loosely branched geometry. The second pair of colony geometries were derived from a scan of a single Montipora capitata colony, one with the verrucae covering the surface intact, and one with the verrucae removed. We found that the mean velocity profiles in the densely branched colony changed substantially in the middle of the colony, becoming significantly reduced at middle heights where flow penetration was poor, while the mean velocity profiles in the loosely branched colony remained similar in character from the front to the back of the colony, with no middle-range velocity deficit appearing at the center of the colony. When comparing the turbulent flow statistics at the surface of the rough and smooth M. capitata colonies, we found higher Reynolds stress components for the smooth colony, indicating higher rates of mixing and transport compared to the rough colony, which must sacrifice mixing and transport efficiency in order to maintain its surface integrity in its natural high-flow environment. These results suggest that the densely branched, roughly patterned corals found in high flow areas may be more resistant not only to breakage, but also to flow penetration.",
