    "abstract": "Cell-based immunotherapies have tremendous potential to treat many diseases, such as activating immunity in cancer or suppressing it in autoimmune diseases. Most cell-based cancer immunotherapies in the clinic provide adjuvant signals through genetic engineering to enhance T cell functions. However, genetically encoded signals have minimal control over dosing and persist for the life of a cell lineage. These properties make it difficult to balance increasing therapeutic efficacy with reducing toxicities. Here, we demonstrated the potential of phospholipid-coupled ligands as a non-genetic system for immune cell engineering. This system provides simple, controlled, non-genetic adjuvant delivery to immune cells via lipid-mediated insertion into plasma membranes. Lipid-mediated insertion (depoting) successfully delivered Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands intracellularly and onto cell surfaces of diverse immune cells. These ligands depoted into immune cells in a dose-controlled fashion and did not compete during multiplex pairwise loading. Immune cell activation could be enhanced by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms depending on the biology of the TLR ligand tested. We determined that depoted ligands can functionally persist on plasma membranes for up to four days in naive and activated T cells, enhancing their activation, proliferation, and skewing cytokine secretion. Depoted ligands provide a persistent yet non-permanent adjuvant signal to immune cells that may minimize the intensity and duration of toxicities compared to permanent genetic delivery. Altogether, these findings demonstrate potential for lipid-mediated insertion (depoting) as a universal cell engineering approach with unique, complementary advantages to other cell engineering methods.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy for solid tumors is limited by the lack of tumor-restricted and homogeneous expression of tumor antigens1,2. Therefore, we engineered an oncolytic virus to express a non-signaling, truncated CD19 (CD19t) protein for tumor-selective delivery, enabling targeting by CD19-specific CAR T cells. Infecting tumor cells with a chimeric oncolytic vaccinia virus coding for CD19t (OV19t) produced de novo CD19 surface-antigen expression prior to virus-mediated tumor lysis. Co-cultured CD19-CAR T cells secreted cytokines and elicited potent cytolytic activity against infected tumors. Using multiple mouse tumor models, intratumoral delivery of OV19t induced tumor expression of CD19t and improved tumor control following CD19-CAR T cell administration. CAR T cell-mediated tumor killing also promoted release of virus from dying tumor cells, which propogated tumor expression of CD19t. These data demonstrate a novel immunotherapy approach utilizing oncolytic viruses to promote de novo CAR T cell targeting of solid tumors.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe describe a novel and effective combination immunotherapy utilizing oncolytic viruses to deliver de novo cell surface expression of CD19 antigen promoting CD19-CAR T cell anti-tumor responses against solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult malignant brain tumor. Recurrence is driven invading tumor cells that escape surgical resection and demonstrate resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A large body of research has been conducted on tumor cell motility. However, typical in vitro models make use of polystyrene culture dishes, which exhibit significantly different physical parameters than brain tissue. Here we report on the use of human organotypic brain slices as an ex vivo approach for the dynamic study of GBM cell motility.\n\nTemporal lobectomy tissue from epilepsy patients was obtained and cut into 350{micro}m thick slices. After the tissue slices had a weeks incubation for recovery, fluorescently labeled tumor cells were seeded. We then tracked individual tumor cells using time-lapse fluorescent confocal microscopy. Quantification of motility characteristics, including mean squared displacement, total path length, and consistency, allowed for comparison of different conditions, including knockdown of cell surface proteins integrin v (ITGAV) and CD44.\n\nHuman organotypics demonstrated minimal variability across specimen in terms of motility parameters, including total path length, averaged instantaneous velocity, and consistency. Knockdown of the traditional motility protein ITGAV showed little effect on overall motility while knockdown of CD44 resulted in a significant reduction in both averaged instantaneous velocity and total path length. When the same parameters were examined using Matrigel, ITGAV and CD44 both showed decreased motility, highlighting the impact of the physical environment on cell behavior. Finally, cell motility in mouse organotypic slices was decreased when compared to human organotypic slices.\n\nHere we demonstrate the use of human organotypic brain slices in the study of GBM cell invasion. This model system offers a physiologically-relevant environment in which to examine the dynamic process of cell motility.",

    "abstract": "Solid tumors require an efficient decision-making mechanism to progress through a gradient of hypoxia. Here, we show that an oxygen-sensory p53 tetramer-octamer switch makes cell decision for survival or death in variable hypoxia. Trapping homo-oligomers from biosynthesis cycle, we found a metastable p53 tetramer in cells. Under the operation of switch, tetramer segregates the p53 character of a tumor suppressor and promoter. The p53 switch generates a pattern of its on-off state in time that is specific to the strength of hypoxia. A bidirectional tetramer-octamer conversion in on state decides the restoration of basal state by forward and programs apoptosis upon the reverse shift via p53-MDM2 loop. However, reversible dimertetramer transitions in off state trigger chaperoning of HIF-1 complex by tetramer in forward and oncogenic gain-of-function by prion-like dimers in reverse direction. Temporal on-off patterns calibrate stabilized p53 pool by defining the abundance of dimer, tetramer and octamer that ultimately decides diverse cellular outcomes in hypoxia. Through multi-chromophore FRET, we further show that chaperoning of HIF-1 may modulate angiogenesis through a possible flip-flop of the p53T-HIF-1 complex upon DNA. Our results demonstrate how p53 can sense oxygen and act upon its homo-oligomerization states to control cell fate in hypoxic tumors.",

Here, we studied the blood immunome of 1001 individuals age 8-96 and derived an inflammatory clock of aging (iAge), which tracked with multi-morbidity and immunosenescence. In centenarians, iAge was on average, 40 years lower than their corresponding chronological age. The strongest contributor to this metric was the chemokine CXCL9, which was involved in cardiac aging, affected vascular function, and down-regulated Sirtuin-3, a longevity-associated molecule. Thus, our results identify an important link between inflammatory molecules and pathways known to govern lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Several virulence lipids populate the outer cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria (Jackson, 2014). Phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids (Anderson, 1929), plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs (Camacho et al., 2001; Cox et al., 1999; Murry et al., 2009) and in evading these programs altogether (Cambier et al., 2014a; Rousseau et al., 2004). Immediately following infection, mycobacteria rely on PDIM to evade toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of bactericidal monocytes which can clear infection (Cambier et al., 2014b). To circumvent the limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipid function, we developed a chemical approach to introduce a clickable, semi-synthetic PDIM onto the cell wall of Mycobacterium marinum. Upon infection of zebrafish, we found that PDIM rapidly spreads into host epithelial membranes, and that this spreading inhibits TLR activation. PDIMs ability to spread into epithelial membranes correlated with its enhanced fluidity afforded by its methyl-branched mycocerosic acids. Additionally, PDIMs affinity for cholesterol promoted its occupation of epithelial membranes; treatment of zebrafish with statins, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, decreased spreading and provided protection from infection. This work establishes that interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting PDIM spread.",

    "abstract": "The building evidence for the contribution of microbiota to human disease has spurred an effort to develop therapies that target the gut microbiota. This is particularly evident in inflammatory bowel diseases, where clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplant have shown some efficacy. To aid the development of novel microbiota-targeted therapies and to better understand the biology underpinning such treatments, we have used gnotobiotic mice to model microbiota manipulations in the context of microbiotas from humans with inflammatory bowel disease. Mice colonized with IBD donor-derived microbiotas exhibit a stereotypical set of phenotypes, characterized by abundant mucosal Th17 cells and a deficit in the tolerogenic ROR{gamma}t+ Treg cell subset. Transplanting healthy donor-derived microbiota into mice colonized with human IBD microbiotas lead to induction of ROR{gamma}t+ Treg cells, which was associated with an increase in the density of the microbiotas following transplant. Microbiota transplant reduced gut Th17 cells in mice colonized with a microbiota from a donor with Crohns disease. By culturing strains from this microbiota and screening them in vivo, we identified a specific strain that potently induces Th17 cells. Microbiota transplants reduced the relative abundance of this strain in the gut microbiota, correlated with a reduction in Th17 cells.",

SIRIUS has become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectra, and shows outstanding performance for identifying the molecular formula of a query compound, being the first step of structure identification. Nevertheless, the identification of both molecular formulas for large compounds above 500 Daltons and novel molecular formulas remains highly challenging. Here, we present ZODIAC, a network-based algorithm for the de novo estimation of molecular formulas. ZODIAC reranks SIRIUS molecular formula candidates, combining fragmentation tree computation with Bayesian statistics using Gibbs sampling. Through careful algorithm engineering, ZODIACs Gibbs sampling is very swift in practice. ZODIAC decreases incorrect annotations 16.2-fold on a challenging plant extract dataset with most compounds above 700 Dalton; we then show improvements on four additional, diverse datasets. Our analysis led to the discovery of compounds with novel molecular formulas such as C24H47BrNO8P which, as of today, is not present in any publicly available molecular structure databases.",

To understand the mechanism of Mcm10-associated disease, we modeled these mutations in human cell lines. Mcm10 deficiency causes chronic replication stress that reduces cell viability due to increased genomic instability and telomere erosion. Our data suggest that loss of Mcm10 function constrains telomerase activity by accumulating abnormal replication fork structures enriched with single-stranded DNA. Terminally-arrested replication forks in Mcm10-deficient cells require endonucleolytic processing by Mus81, as MCM10:MUS81 double mutants display decreased viability and accelerated telomere shortening.

    "abstract": "The fast climate change affects yield in Vigna mungo via enhancing both biotic and abiotic stresses. Out of all factors, the yellow mosaic disease has the most damaging effect. However, due to lack of reference genome of Vigna mungo, the complete mechanism associated with MYMIV (Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Indian Virus) resistance in Vigna mungo remain elusive to date. Considering this, the authors made an attempt to release new transcriptome and its annotation by employing computational approaches. Quality assessment of the generated transcriptomes reveals that it successfully aligned with 99.03% of the raw reads and hence can be employed for future research. Functional annotation of the transcriptome reveals that 31% and [~]14% of the total transcripts encode lncRNAs and protein-coding sequences, respectively. Further, analysis reveals that, out of total transcripts, only 4536 and 78808 are significantly down and up-regulated during MYMIV infection in Vigna mungo, respectively. These significant transcripts are mainly associated with ribosome, spliceosome, glycolysis /gluconeogenesis, RNA transport, oxidative phosphorylation, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK signaling pathway - plant, methionine and cysteine metabolism, purine metabolism and RNA degradation. Unlike the previous study, this is for the first time, the present study identified these pathways may play key role in MYMIV resistance in Vigna mungo. Thus, information and transcriptomes data available in the present study make a significant contribution to understanding the genomic structure of Vigna mungo, enabling future analyses as well as downstream applications of gene expression, sequence evolution, and genome annotation.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of the morphology and connectivity of central neurons. We have previously shown that BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates the activity and mobility of the GTPases Rab5 and Rab11, which in turn determine the post-endocytic sorting of signaling TrkB receptors. Moreover, altered Rab5 or Rab11 activity inhibits BDNF-induced dendritic branching. Whether Rab5 or Rab11 activity is important for local events only, or also for regulating nuclear signaling and gene expression, is unknown. Here, we investigated whether BDNF-induced signaling cascades were altered when early and recycling endosomes were disrupted by the expression of dominant negative mutants of Rab5 and Rab11. The activities of both Rab5 and Rab11 were required for sustained activity of Erk1/2 and nuclear CREB phosphorylation and for increased transcription of BDNF-dependent genes containing CRE-binding sites that include activity-regulated genes such as Arc, Dusp1, c-fos and Egr1 and growth and survival genes such as Atf3 and Nf1. Based on our results, we propose that the early and recycling endosomes provide a platform for the integration of neurotrophic signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in neurons and that this mechanism likely regulates neuronal plasticity and neuronal survival.\n\nSignificance StatementBDNF is a soluble neurotrophic factor that regulates plastic changes in the brain, including dendritic growth, by binding to its plasma membrane receptor TrkB. BDNF/TrkB activates signaling cascades leading to activation of CREB, a key transcription factor regulating circuit development and learning and memory. Our results uncover the cellular mechanisms that central neurons use to integrate the signaling of plasma membrane receptors with nuclear transcriptional responses. We found that the endosomal pathway is required for the signaling cascade initiated by BDNF and its receptors in the plasma membranes to modulate BDNF-dependent gene expression and neuronal dendritic growth mediated by the CREB transcription factor in the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "The differences in life-history traits and processes between organisms living in the same or different populations contribute to determine their ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Recent advances in statistical and computational methods make it easier to investigate individual and group variation in life-history traits.\n\nWe developed mixed-effect model formulations of the popular size-at-age von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions to estimate individual and group variation in body growth, using as a model system four freshwater fish populations living in Slovenian streams, where tagged individuals were sampled for more than 10 years. We used the software Template Model Builder to estimate the parameters of the mixed-effect growth models.\n\nEstimates of asymptotic size from the Gompertz and von Bertalanffy models were not significantly correlated, but their predictions of size-at-age of individuals were strongly correlated (r > 0.99). Tests on data that were not used to estimate model parameters showed that predictions of individual growth trajectories using the random-effects model were accurately predicted (R2 > 0.80 for the best models over more than 500 predictions) starting from one single observation of body size early in life. Model results pointed to size ranks that are largely maintained throughout the lifetime of individuals in all populations.",

    "abstract": "In humans, most germline mutations are inherited from the father. This observation is widely interpreted as resulting from the replication errors that accrue during spermatogenesis. If so, the male bias in mutation should be substantially lower in a closely related species with similar rates of spermatogonial stem cell divisions but a shorter mean age of reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we resequenced two 3-4 generation nuclear families (totaling 29 individuals) of olive baboons (Papio anubis), who reproduce at ~10 years of age on average. We inferred sex-specific mutation rates by analyzing the data in parallel with three three-generation human pedigrees (26 individuals). The mutation rate per generation in baboons is 0.55x10-8 per base pair, approximately half that of humans. Strikingly, however, the degree of male mutation bias is approximately 3:1, similar to that of humans; in fact, a similar male bias is seen across mammals that reproduce months, years or decades after birth. These results echo findings in humans that the male bias is stable with parental ages and cast further doubt on the assumption that germline mutations track cell divisions. Our mutation rate estimates for baboons raise a further puzzle in suggesting a divergence time between apes and Old World Monkeys of 67 My, too old to be consistent with the fossil record; reconciling them now requires not only a slowdown of the mutation rate per generation in humans but also in baboons.",

A key question is how do transcriptional enhancers influence these events to control gene expression? Here we have used a new approach to quantify transcriptional initiation and pausing in vivo, while simultaneously identifying transcription start sites (TSSs) and pause-sites (TPSs) from single RNA molecules. When analyzed in parallel with nascent RNA-seq, these data show that differential gene expression is achieved predominantly via changes in transcription initiation rather than Pol II pausing. Using genetically engineered mouse models deleted for specific enhancers we show that these elements control gene expression via Pol II recruitment and/or initiation rather than via promoter proximal pause release.

Several effectors, called metaeffectors, function regulate the activity of other Dot/Icm-translocated effectors during infection. The metaeffector Lpg2505 is essential for L. pneumophila intracellular replication only when its cognate effector, SidI, is present. SidI is a cytotoxic effector that interacts with the host translation factor eEF1A and potently inhibits eukaryotic protein translation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we evaluated the impact of Lpg2505 on SidI-mediated phenotypes and investigated the mechanism of SidI function. We determined that Lpg2505 binds with nanomolar affinity to SidI and suppresses SidI-mediated inhibition of protein translation. SidI binding to eEF1A and SusF is not mutually exclusive and these proteins bind distinct regions of SidI. We also discovered that SidI possesses GDP-dependent glycosyltransferase activity and that this activity is regulated by Lpg2505. We have therefore renamed Lpg2505, SusF (suppressor of SidI function). This work reveals novel enzymatic activity for SidI and provides insight into how intracellular replication of L. pneumophila is regulated by a metaeffector.",

Whilst Seoul is known to be pathogenic in humans, only partial fragments of Tatenale have been recovered, precluding any accurate analysis of its phylogeny or potential pathogenicity. To overcome this shortfall we used a degenerate primer PCR method to identify Tatenale-infection in rodents living in two separate locations in the UK. PCR positive samples were then subjected to either unbiased high-throughput sequencing or overlapping PCR product sequencing to recover the complete coding sequence of the Tatenale virus. This analysis provided in-depth insight into the evolutionary origins of this recently identified UK Orthohantavirus and unequivocally showed that Tatenale virus meets the established criteria for classification as a novel species.

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalising syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterise taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth \"CS\") to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from the survey metadata. Specifically, we modelled taxon responses to soil pH at the OTU level using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF) models, to provide information on putative landscape scale pH-abundance responses. We identify that most of the soil OTUs examined exhibit predictable abundance responses across soil pH gradients, though with the exception of known acidophilic lineages, the pH optima of OTU relative abundance was variable and could not be generalised by broad taxonomy. This highlights the need for tools and databases to predict ecological traits at finer taxonomic resolution. We further demonstrate the utility of the database by testing against geographically dispersed query 16S datasets; evaluating efficacy by quantifying matches, and accuracy in predicting pH responses of query sequences from a separate large soil survey. We found that the CS database provided good coverage of dominant taxa; and that the taxa indicating soil pH in a query dataset corresponded with the pH classifications of top matches in the CS database. Furthermore we were able to predict query dataset community structure, using predicted abundances of dominant taxa based on query soil pH data and the HOF models of matched CS database taxa. The database with associated HOF model outputs is released as an online portal for querying single sequences of interest (https://shiny-apps.ceh.ac.uk/ID-TaxER), and as a DADA2 database for use in bioinformatics pipelines. The further development of advanced informatics infrastructures incorporating modelled ecological attributes along with new functional genomic information will likely facilitate large scale exploration and prediction of soil microbial functional biodiversity under current and future environmental change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Cellular differentiation is a fundamental strategy used by cells to generate specialized functions at specific stages of development. The bacterium C. crescentus employs a specialized dimorphic life cycle consisting of two differentiated cell types. How environmental cues, including mechanical inputs such as contact with a surface, regulate this cell cycle remain unclear. Here, we find that surface sensing by the physical perturbation of retracting extracellular pilus filaments accelerates cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation. We show that physical obstruction of dynamic pilus activity by chemical perturbation or by a mutation in the outer membrane pilus pore protein, CpaC, stimulates early initiation of chromosome replication. In addition, we find that surface contact stimulates cell cycle progression by demonstrating that surface-stimulated cells initiate early chromosome replication to the same extent as planktonic cells with obstructed pilus activity. Finally, we show that obstruction of pilus retraction stimulates the synthesis of the cell cycle regulator, cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) through changes in the activity and localization of two key regulatory histidine kinases that control cell fate and differentiation. Together, these results demonstrate that surface contact and mechanosensing by alterations in pilus activity stimulate C. crescentus to bypass its developmentally programmed temporal delay in cell differentiation to more quickly adapt to a surface-associated lifestyle.\n\nSignificanceCells from all domains of life sense and respond to mechanical cues [1-3]. In eukaryotes, mechanical signals such as adhesion and surface stiffness are important for regulating fundamental processes including cell differentiation during embryonic development [4]. While mechanobiology is abundantly studied in eukaryotes, the role of mechanical influences on prokaryotic biology remains under-investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanosensing mediated through obstruction of the dynamic extension and retraction of tight adherence (tad) pili stimulates cell differentiation and cell cycle progression in the dimorphic -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus.

We then investigated the relationship between activity, alternative splicing and synapse formation within this population. Specifically, we discovered that the Nova family of RNA-binding proteins are activity-dependent and are essential for the maturation of somatostatin interneurons, as well as their afferent and efferent connectivity. Within this population, Nova2 preferentially mediates the alternative splicing of genes required for axonal formation and synaptic function independently from its effect on gene expression. Hence, our work demonstrates that the Nova family of proteins through alternative splicing are centrally involved in coupling developmental neuronal activity to cortical circuit formation.",

By transcriptionally profiling sensory ganglia at single-cell resolution, we find that different somatosensory neuronal subtypes undergo a remarkably consistent and dramatic transcriptional response to peripheral nerve injury that both promotes axonal regeneration and suppresses cell identity. Successful axonal regeneration leads to a restoration of neuronal cell identity and the deactivation of the growth program. This injury-induced transcriptional reprogramming requires Atf3, a transcription factor which is induced rapidly after injury and is necessary for axonal regeneration and functional recovery. While Atf3 and other injury-induced transcription factors are known for their role in reprogramming cell fate, their function in mature neurons is likely to facilitate major adaptive changes in cell function in response to damaging environmental stimuli.",

Theoretical work shows that information required to discriminate two similar stimuli is limited by the correlation structure of cortical variability. We investigated these information-limiting correlations by recording simultaneously from visual cortical areas V1 and V4 in macaque monkeys, performing a binocular, stereo-depth discrimination task. Within both areas, noise correlations on a rapid temporal scale (20-30ms) were stronger for neuron-pairs with similar selectivity for binocular depth, meaning that these correlations potentially limit information for making the discrimination. Between-area correlations (V1 to V4) were different, being weaker for neuron pairs with similar tuning, and having a slower temporal scale (100+ms). Fluctuations in these information-limiting correlations just prior to the detection event were associated with changes in behavioural accuracy. Although these correlations limit the recovery of information about sensory targets, their impact may be curtailed by integrative processing of signals across multiple brain areas.",

Here, we provide evidence from two fMRI studies that a region of the left Middle Temporal Gyrus (MTG) exhibits a surprising representational asymmetry: verbs and patients (to whom was it done?) are bound to form a representation, but verbs and agents (who did it?) are not. Within MTG, BOLD signal to novel combinations of familiar components can be modeled by combining learned verb-patient conjunctive representations with more general agent representations, but not by the converse (verb-agent + patient). This asymmetry is not predicted by an abstract propositional representation of the event (e.g., chased(dog,cat), nor by a theory which derives conjunctions from the experienced statistical co-occurences between verbs and nouns. However, this asymmetry is predicted by various linguistic accounts of the internal structure of event descriptions (e.g., Williams, 1981; Marantz,1984; Grimshaw, 1990; Kratzer, 1996).

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been applied on various tissues in order to recognize malignancies. However, these models focus on relatively narrow tissue context or well-defined pathologies. Here, instead of focusing on pathologies, we introduce models characterizing the diversity of normal tissues. We obtained 1,690 slides with rat tissue samples from the control groups of six preclinical toxicology studies, on which tissue regions were outlined and annotated by pathologists into 46 different tissue classes. From these annotated regions, we sampled small patches of 224 x 224 pixels at six different levels of magnification. Using four studies as training set and two studies as test set, we trained VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inception-v3 networks separately at each of these magnification levels. Among these models, Inception-v3 consistently outperformed the other networks and attained accuracies up to 83.4% (top-3 accuracy: 96.3%). Further analysis showed that most tissue confusions occurred within clusters of histologically similar tissues. Investigation of the embedding layer using the UMAP method revealed not only pronounced clusters corresponding to the individual tissues, but also subclusters corresponding to histologically meaningful structures that had neither been annotated nor trained for. This suggests that the histological representation learned by the normal histology network could also be used to flag abnormal tissue as outliers in the embedding space without a need to explicitly train for specific types of abnormalities. Finally, we found that models trained on rat tissues can be used on non-human primate and minipig tissues with minimal retraining.\n\nAuthor contributionT.S. and H.H. contributed equally to this work.\n\nSignificance statementLike many other scientific disciplines, histopathology has been profoundly impacted by recent advances in machine learning with deep neural networks. In this field, most deep learning models reported in the literature are trained on pathologies in specific tissues/contexts. Here, we aim to establish a model of normal tissues as a foundation for future models of histopathology. We build models that are specific to histopathology images and we show that their embeddings are better feature vectors for describing the underlying images than those of off-the shelf CNN models. Therefore, our models could be useful for transfer learning to improve the accuracy of other histopathology models.",

Identification of DUB substrates is challenging because multiple DUBs act on the same substrates, thwarting genetic approaches. Here, we circumvented redundancy by broadly inhibiting DUBs in Xenopus egg extract. DUB inhibition increases ubiquitylation of hundreds of proteins, depleting free ubiquitin without inducing widespread degradation. Restoring available ubiquitin led to proteasomal degradation of over thirty proteins, indicating that deubiquitylation is essential to maintain their stability. We confirmed their DUB-dependent stability with recombinant human proteins, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. We profiled the ability of DUBs to rescue protein stability, and found that USP7 has a unique ability to broadly antagonize proteasomal degradation. Together, we provide a comprehensive characterization of ubiquitin dynamics in the Xenopus system, identify new DUB substrates, and present a new approach to characterize physiological DUB specificity that overcomes challenges posed by DUB redundancy",

    "abstract": "Intercalation of drug molecules into synthetic DNA nanostructures formed through self-assembled origami has been postulated as a valuable future method for targeted drug delivery. This is due to the excellent biocompatibility of synthetic DNA nanostructures, and high potential for flexible programmability including facile drug release into or near to target cells. Such favourable properties may enable high initial loading and efficient release for a predictable number of drug molecules per nanostructure carrier, important for efficient delivery of safe and effective drug doses to minimise non-specific release away from target cells. However, basic questions remain as to how intercalation-mediated loading depends on the DNA carrier structure. Here we use the interaction of dyes YOYO-1 and acridine orange with a tightly-packed 2D DNA origami tile as a simple model system to investigate intercalation-mediated loading. We employed multiple biophysical techniques including single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy, gel electrophoresis and controllable damage using low temperature plasma on synthetic DNA origami samples. Our results indicate that not all potential DNA binding sites are accessible for dye intercalation, which has implications for future DNA nanostructures designed for targeted drug delivery.",

The resulting transient temperature differences generate transient tensile stresses in the support foil. Most of this foil stress develops while the sample is liquid and cooling toward its glass transition Tg, and so does not generate tensile sample stress. As the grid bars continue cooling toward the cryogen temperature and contracting, the tensile stress in the foil is released, placing the sample in compressive stress. Radiation-induced creep in the presence of this compressive stress should generate a doming of the sample in the foil openings, as is observed experimentally. Crude estimates of the magnitude of doming that may be generated by this mechanism are consistent with observation. Several approaches to reducing beam-induced motion are discussed.",

Here, we examine two extensively-studied KPR circuits, DNA replication by the T7 DNA polymerase and translation by the E. coli ribosome. Using experimental data, we analyze the performance of these two vital systems in light of the fundamental bounds set by the recently-discovered thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which places an inherent trade-off between the precision of a desirable output and the amount of energy dissipation required. We show that the DNA polymerase operates close to the TUR lower bound, while the ribosome operates ~ 5 times farther from this bound. This difference originates from the enhanced binding discrimination of the polymerase which allows it to operate effectively as a reduced reaction cycle prioritizing correct product formation. We show that approaching this limit also decouples the thermodynamic uncertainty factor from speed and error, thereby relaxing the accuracy-speed trade-off of the system. Altogether, our results show that operating near this reduced cycle limit not only minimizes thermodynamic uncertainty, but also results in global performance enhancement of KPR circuits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearchers often measure changes in gene expression across conditions to better understand the shared functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of different genes. Analogous to this is comparing gene expression across species, which can improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the evolution of both individual genes and functional pathways. One area of interest is determining genes showing signals of coevolution, which can also indicate potential functional similarity, analogous to co-expression analysis often performed across conditions for a single species. However, as with any trait, comparing gene expression across species can be confounded by the non-independence of species due to shared ancestry, making standard hypothesis testing inappropriate.\n\nResultsWe compared RNA-Seq data across 18 fungal species using a multivariate Brownian Motion phylogenetic comparative method (PCM), which allowed us to quantify coevolution between protein pairs while directly accounting for the shared ancestry of the species. Our work indicates proteins which physically-interact show stronger signals of coevolution than randomly-generated pairs. Interactions with stronger empirical and computational evidence also showing stronger signals of coevolution. We examined the effects of number of protein interactions and gene expression levels on coevolution, finding both factors are overall poor predictors of the strength of coevolution between a protein pair. Simulations further demonstrate the potential issues of analyzing gene expression coevolution without accounting for shared ancestry in a standard hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, our simulations indicate the use of a randomly-generated null distribution as a means of determining statistical significance for detecting coevolving genes with phylogenetically-uncorrected correlations, as has previously been done, is less accurate than PCMs, although is a significant improvement over standard hypothesis testing. These methods are further improved by using a phylogenetically-corrected correlation metric.\n\nConclusionsOur work highlights potential benefits of using PCMs to detect gene expression coevolution from high-throughput omics scale data. This framework can be built upon to investigate other evolutionary hypotheses, such as changes in transcription regulatory mechanisms across species.",

This perturbation impairs sister chromosome linkage and reduces reproductive fitness by 45%. We evolved 15 populations for 1750 generations, substantially increasing their fitness, and analyzed their genotypes and phenotypes. We found no mutations in Rec8, but many populations had mutations in the transcriptional mediator complex, cohesin-related genes, and cell cycle regulators that induce S phase.

Scat samples were genotyped at seven autosomal microsatellite loci and at a X/Y locus for sex identification, which allowed estimating a minimum of 11 individuals present in the reserve from 2011 to 2015. The genetic recapture of 7 of these individuals enabled diachronic monitoring, providing indications of individuals movements throughout the reserve.

Previously we and other groups purified circular DNA and linearized them by rolling circle amplification for paired end high throughput sequencing to identify eccDNA in cells and tissues. We hypothesized that many eccDNA will have more open chromatin and so will be susceptible to linearization and sequencing by tagmentation. Indeed, we find that ATAC-seq on cell lines and cancers, without any enrichment of circular DNA, identifies thousands of eccDNAs. The identified eccDNAs in cell lines were validated by inverse PCR on DNA that survives exonuclease digestion of linear DNA and by metaphase FISH. We demonstrate that ATAC-seq data generated in Lower Grade Gliomas (LGG) and Glioblastomas (GBM) identify eccDNAs, including one containing the well-known EGFR gene amplicon from chr7. Many of the eccDNAs are identified even before amplification of the locus is detected by genotyping arrays. Thus, standard ATAC-seq is a sensitive method to detect segments of DNA that are present as eccDNA in a subset of the tumor cells, ready to be further amplified under appropriate selection, as during therapy.",

    "abstract": "Viruses that infect bacteria, i.e., bacteriophage or  phage, are increasingly considered as treatment options for the control and clearance of bacterial infections, particularly as compassionate use therapy for multi-drug resistant infections. In practice, clinical use of phage often involves the application of multiple therapeutic phage, either together or sequentially. However, the selection and timing of therapeutic phage delivery remains largely ad hoc. In this study, we evaluate principles underlying why careful application of multiple phage (i.e., a  cocktail) might lead to therapeutic success in contrast to the failure of single-strain phage therapy to control an infection. First, we use a nonlinear dynamics model of within-host interactions to show that a combination of fast intra-host phage decay, evolution of phage resistance amongst bacteria, and/or compromised immune response might limit the effectiveness of single-strain phage therapy. To resolve these problems, we combine dynamical modeling of phage, bacteria, and host immune cell populations with control-theoretic principles (via optimal control theory) to devise evolutionarily robust phage cocktails and delivery schedules to control the bacterial populations. Our numerical results suggest that optimal administration of single-strain phage therapy may be sufficient for curative outcomes in immunocompetent patients, but may fail in immunodeficient hosts due to phage resistance. We show that optimized treatment with a two-phage cocktail that includes a counter-resistant phage can restore therapeutic efficacy in immunodeficient hosts.",

    "abstract": "Alphaherpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV), are neuroinvasive pathogens that establish life-long latency in peripheral ganglia following the initial infection at mucosal surfaces. The establishment of latent infection and the subsequent reactivations during which newly-assembled virions are sorted into and transported anterogradely inside axons to the initial mucosal site of infection, rely on axonal bidirectional transport mediated by microtubule-based motors. Previous studies using cultured peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons have demonstrated that KIF1A, a kinesin-3 motor, mediates the efficient axonal sorting and transport of newly-assembled PRV virions. In this study, we report that KIF1A, unlike other axonal kinesins, is an intrinsically unstable protein prone to proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, PRV infection of neuronal cells leads not only to a non-specific depletion of KIF1A mRNA, but also to an accelerated proteasomal degradation of KIF1A proteins, leading to a near depletion of KIF1A protein late in infection. Using a series of PRV mutants deficient in axonal sorting and anterograde spread, we identified the PRV US9/gE/gI protein complex as a viral factor facilitating the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A proteins. Moreover, by using compartmented neuronal cultures that fluidically and physically separate axons from cell bodies, we found that the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A occurs in axons during infection. We propose that PRV anterograde sorting complex, gE/gI/US9, recruits KIF1A to viral transport vesicles for axonal sorting and transport, and eventually accelerates the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A in axons.\n\nImportancePseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens herpes simplex virus -1, -2 and varicella zoster virus. Alphaherpesviruses are neuroinvasive pathogens that establish life-long latent infections in the host peripheral nervous system (PNS). Following reactivation from latency, infection spreads from the PNS back via axons to the peripheral mucosal tissues, a process mediated by kinesin motors. Here, we unveil and characterize the underlying mechanisms for a PRV-induced, accelerated degradation of KIF1A, a kinesin-3 motor promoting the sorting and transport of PRV virions in axons. We show that PRV infection disrupts the synthesis of KIF1A, and simultaneously promotes the degradation of intrinsically unstable KIF1A proteins by proteasomes in axons. Our work implies that the timing of motor reduction after reactivation would be critical because progeny particles would have a limited time window for sorting into and transport in axons for further host-to-host spread.",

Tyrosinekinase inhibitor drugs like imatinib are the mainstay of treatment and cases resistant to these drugs have a poor prognosis in the absence of a compatible stem-cell donor. However, with rapid advancements in gene-editing technologies, most studies are now focusing on developing a translational model targeting single-gene disorders with a prospective permanent cure.\n\nObjectiveTo explore the potential application of the RNA targeting CRISPR-Cas13a system for effective knockdown of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in a CML cell line, K562.\n\nMethodCRISPR Cas13a crRNA was designed specific to the chimeric BCR-ABL gene and the system was transfected as a two-plasmid system into a CML cell line, K562. The effects were enumerated by evaluating the expression levels of downstream genes dependent on the expression of the BCR-ABL gene. Also, next-generation sequencing was used to ascertain the effects of CRISPR on the gene.\n\nResultsThe CRISPR system was successfully able to lower the expression of downstream genes (pCRKL and pCRK) dependent on the activated BCR-ABL kinase signal by up-to 4.3 folds. The viability of the CRISPR treated cells were also significantly lowered by 373.83-fold (p-value= 0.000891196). The time-dependent kinetics also highlighted the significant in-vitro suppressive activity to last up to 8 weeks (p-value: 0.025). As per the cDNA sequencing data from Oxford MinION next-generation sequencer, the CRISPR treated cells show 62.37% suspected cleaved reads.\n\nConclusionThese preliminary results highlight an excellent potential application of RNA targeting CRISPRs in Haematological neoplasms like CML and should pave way for further research in this direction.",

    "abstract": "Acute brain slice preparation is a powerful experimental model for investigating the characteristics of synaptic function in the brain. Although brain tissue is usually cut at ice-cold temperature (CT) to facilitate slicing and avoid neuronal damage, exposure to CT causes molecular and architectural changes of synapses. To address these issues, we investigated ultrastructural and electrophysiological features of synapses in mouse acute cerebellar slices prepared at ice-cold and physiological temperature (PT). In the slices prepared at CT, we found significant spine loss and reconstruction, synaptic vesicle rearrangement and decrease in synaptic proteins, all of which were not detected in slices prepared at PT. Consistent with these structural findings, slices prepared at PT showed higher release probability and higher detectability of long-term depression after motor learning compared with slices prepared at CT. These results indicate substantial advantages of the slice preparation at PT for investigating synaptic functions in different physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between individuals and the environment are mediated by the body and occur within the peri-personal space (PPS) - the space surrounding the body. The multisensory encoding of this space plastically adapts to different bodily constraints and stimuli features. However, these remapping effects have only been demonstrated on the time-scale of days, hours, or minutes. Yet, if PPS mediates human-environment interactions in an adaptive manner, its representation should be altered by sensory history on trial-to-trial timescale. Here we test this idea first via a visuo-tactile reaction time paradigm in augmented reality where participants are asked to respond as fast as possible to touch, as visual object approach them. Results demonstrate that reaction times to touch are facilitated as a function of visual proximity, and the sigmoidal function describing this facilitation shifts closer to the body if the immediately precedent trial had indexed a smaller visuo-tactile disparity (i.e., positive serial dependency). Next, we derive the electroencephalographic correlates of PPS and demonstrate that this measure is equally shaped by recent sensory history. Finally, we demonstrate that a validated neural network model of PPS is able to account for the present results via a simple Hebbian plasticity rule. The present findings suggest that PPS encoding remaps on a very rapid time-scale and is sensitive to recent sensory history.",

    "abstract": "Self-sustained, elevated neuronal activity persisting on time scales of ten seconds or longer is thought to be vital for aspects of working memory, including brain representations of real space. Continuous-attractor neural networks, one of the most well-known modeling frameworks for persistent activity, have been able to model crucial aspects of such spatial memory. These models tend to require highly structured or regular synaptic architectures. In contrast, we elaborate a geometrically-embedded model with a local but otherwise random connectivity profile which, combined with a global regulation of the mean firing rate, produces localized, finely spaced discrete attractors that effectively span a 2D manifold. We demonstrate how the set of attracting states can reliably encode a representation of the spatial locations at which the system receives external input, thereby accomplishing spatial memory via attractor dynamics without synaptic fine-tuning or regular structure. We measure the networks storage capacity and find that the statistics of retrievable positions are also equivalent to a full tiling of the plane, something hitherto achievable only with (approximately) translationally invariant synapses, and which may be of interest in modeling such biological phenomena as visuospatial working memory in two dimensions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpermatogenesis is the process by which germ cells develop into spermatozoa in the testis. Sperm protamines are small, arginine-rich nuclear proteins which replace somatic histones during spermatogenesis, allowing a hypercondensed DNA state that leads to a smaller nucleus and facilitating sperm head formation. In eutherian mammals, the protamine-DNA complex is achieved through a combination of intra- and intermolecular cysteine cross-linking and possibly histidine-cysteine zinc ion binding. Most metatherian sperm protamines lack cysteine but perform the same function. This lack of dicysteine cross-linking has made the mechanism behind metatherian protamines folding unclear.\n\nResultsProtamine sequences from UniProts databases were pulled down and sorted into homologous groups. Multiple sequence alignments were then generated and a gap weighted relative entropy score calculated for each position. For the eutherian alignments, the cysteine containing positions were the most highly conserved. For the metatherian alignment, the tyrosine containing positions were the most highly conserved and corresponded to the cysteine positions in the eutherian alignment.\n\nConclusionsHigh conservation indicates likely functionally/structurally important residues at these positions in the metatherian protamines and the correspondence with cysteine positions within the eutherian alignment implies a similarity in function. One explanation is that the metatherian protamine structure relies upon dityrosine cross-linking between these highly conserved tyrosines. Also, the human protamine P1 sequence has a tyrosine substitution in a position expecting eutherian dicysteine cross-linking. Similarly, some members of the metatherian Planigales genus contain cysteine substitutions in positions expecting plausible metatherian dityrosine cross-linking. Rare cysteine-tyrosine cross-linking could explain both observations.",

It is well known that crowding reduces the volume available to reactants, which increases reaction rates, and also inhibits reactant diffusion, which decreases reaction rates. This work investigates these effects quantitatively using analytical theory and particle-based simulations. A reaction rate equation based on only these two processes turned out to be inconsistent with simulation results. However, accounting for diffusion inhibition by the surfaces of nearby obstacles, which affects access to reactants, led to perfect agreement for reactions near impermeable planar membranes and improved agreement for reactions in crowded spaces. A separate model that quantified reactant occlusion by crowders, and extensions to a thermodynamic \"cavity\" model proposed by Berezhkovskii and Szabo (J. Phys. Chem.

    "abstract": "Background: Some recent studies have challenged the direction of causality for the association between cannabis use and psychotic disorder, suggesting that cannabis use initiation is explained by common genetic variants associated with risk of schizophrenia. We used data from the European Union Gene-Environment Interaction consortium (EUGEI) case-control study to test for the independent and combined effect of heavy cannabis use, and of Schizophrenia Polygenic risk score (SZ PRS), on risk for psychotic disorder. Methods: Genome-wide data were obtained from 492 first episode psychosis patients (FEPp) and from 787 controls of European Ancestry, and used to generate SZ PRS from the summary results of an independent meta-analysis. Information on pattern of cannabis use was used to build a 7-level frequency-type composite cannabis use measure that we previously found was a strong predictor of psychotic disorder. Results: SZ PRS did not predict cannabis initiation (b=0.027; p=0.51) or how frequently controls (b=0.027; p=0.06) or FEPp (b=0.006; p=0.91) used it, or the type of cannabis they used (Controls: b = 0.032; p=0.31); FEPp: b= 0.005; p=0.89). The frequency-type composite cannabis use measure (OR=1.32; 95% CI 1.22-1.44) and SZ PRS (OR=2.29; 95%CI 1.71-3.05) showed independent effects from each other on the OR for psychotic disorder. Conclusion: SZ PRS does not predict an individual s propensity to try cannabis, frequency of use, or the potency of the cannabis used. Our findings provide the first evidence that SZ PRS and heavy cannabis use exert effects independent from each other on the risk for psychotic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Repair of damaged DNA is required for the viability of all organisms. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, driven by the power of genetic screens, pioneered the discovery and characterization of many genes and pathways involved in DNA repair in animals. However, fewer than half of the alleles identified in these screens have been mapped to a specific gene, leaving a potential for new discoveries in this field. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized mutagen sensitive gene mus302 codes for the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger and WD domain protein 3 (RFWD3). In human cells, RFWD3 promotes ubiquitylation of RPA and RAD51 to facilitate repair of collapsed replication forks and double strand breaks through homologous recombination. Despite the high similarity in sequence to the human ortholog, our evidence fails to support a role for Mus302 in the repair of these types of damage. Last, we observe that the N-terminal third of RFWD3 is only present in mammals and absent in the rest of vertebrates and invertebrates. We propose that the additional N-terminal portion accounts for the acquisition of a new biological function in mammals that explains the functional differences between the human and the fly orthologs, and that Drosophila Mus302 may retain the ancestral function of the protein.",

As other CRISPR loci, this locus is made up of an alternation between direct repeats and spacers, and flanked by cas genes. Unveiling the genetic mechanisms of its evolution requires to have a fairly large amount of fully reconstructed loci among all MTC lineages.\n\nIn this article, we point out and resolve the problem of CRISPR reconstruction based on short read sequences. We first show that more than 1/3 of the currently assembled genomes available for this complex contain a CRISPR locus erroneously reconstructed, and errors can be very significant. Second, we present a new computational method allowing this locus to be reconstructed extensively and reliably in silico using short read sequencing runs. Third, using this method, we describe new structural characteristics of CRISPR locus by lineages. We show how both the classical experimental in vitro approach and the basic in silico spoligotyping provided by existing analytic tools miss a whole diversity of this locus in MTC, by not capturing duplications, spacer and direct repeats variants, and IS6110 insertion locations. This description is extended in a second article that presents general rules for the evolution of the CRISPR locus in MTC.\n\nThis work opens new perspectives for a larger exploration of CRISPR loci diversity and of mechanisms involved in its evolution and its functionality.",

We modelled recognition as the matching of patterns to learned templates, finding that perceptually-meaningful templates are sequences of spatially-identified units, ordered by latencies relative to each other (with minimal effects of sniff). Within templates, individual units contribute additively, with larger contributions from earlier-activated units.

    "abstract": "Background & AimsBacterial effector molecules are the crucial infectious agents and are sufficient to cause pathogenesis. In the present study, pathogenesis of S. Typhi toxic proteins on the model host Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated by exploring the host regulatory proteins during infection through quantitative proteomics approach.\n\nMethodsIn this regard, the host proteome was analysed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) and differentially regulated proteins were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF/MS analysis. Out of the 150 regulated proteins identified, 95 proteins were appeared to be downregulated while 55 were upregulated. Interaction network for regulated proteins was predicted using STRING tool.\n\nResultsMost of the downregulated proteins were found to be involved in muscle contraction, locomotion, energy hydrolysis, lipid synthesis, serine/threonine kinase activity, oxidoreductase activity and protein unfolding and upregulated proteins were found to be involved in oxidative stress pathways. Hence, cellular stress generated by S. Typhi proteome on the model host was determined using lipid peroxidation, oxidant and antioxidant assays. In addition to that the candidate proteins resulted from the host proteome analysis were validated by Western blotting and roles of several crucial molecular players were analyzed in vivo using wild type and mutant C. elegans.\n\nConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the protein regulation in host C. elegans during S. Typhi toxic proteins exposure which highlights the significance of p38 MAPK and JNK immune pathways. These results may provide new clues for future therapeutic approaches for curing bacterial toxin protein-mediated infections in a host system.\n\nSummaryWe have precipitated the toxin proteins of S.Typhi. To gain insight into the worms response to ingestion of toxin, a proteomic analysis was performed to monitor the changes in protein regulation. 150 differential regulated proteins were identified, amongst 95 and 55 proteins were found to be downregulated and upregulated, respectively. This is the first study that reported the global proteome changes in C. elegans against toxin. Our findings suggested involvement of several regulatory proteins that appear to play a role in various molecular functions in combating toxin-mediated microbial pathogenicity and/or host C. elegans immunity modulation. A proteomics approach using C. elegans can facilitate the understanding of how toxin can lead to intoxication, which pave a way for delineating how higher eukaryotes could evolve defenses to protect against bacterial toxin. Toxin infection nematode showed increased accumulation of proteins that respond to oxidative -stress, lipid metabolism, embryonic development, immune and inflammatory processes.",

Our goal was to discover stone type-specific molecular signatures to advance our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis.\n\nResultsBrushite SF did not differ from CaOx SF with respect to metabolic risk factors for stones, but did exhibit increased tubule plugging in their papillae. Brushite SF had upregulation of inflammatory pathways in papillary tissue, and increased neutrophil markers in stone matrix compared to those with CaOx stones. Large-scale 3D tissue cytometry on renal papillary biopsies showed an increase in the number and density of neutrophils in the papillae of brushite vs. CaOx patients, thereby linking the observed inflammatory signatures to the neutrophils in the tissue. To explain how neutrophil proteins appear in the stone matrix, we measured neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, NETosis, and found it significantly increased in the papillae of brushite compared to CaOx patients.\n\nConclusionsWe show that increased neutrophil infiltration and NETosis is an unrecognized factor that differentiates brushite and CaOx SF, and may explain the markedly increased scarring and inflammation seen in the papillae of brushite patients.

The U. maydis effector Jasmonate/Ethylene signaling inducer 1 (Jsi1) possesses an ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, DLNxxP, which interacts with the second WD40 domain of the conserved plant co-repressor family Topless/Topless related (TPL/TPR). Jsi1 interaction with TPL/TPRs leads to derepression of the ethylene response factor (ERF) branch of the JA/ET signaling pathway, supporting biotrophic susceptibility. Jsi1 likely activates the ERF branch by interfering with the binding of endogenous DLNxxP motif-containing ERF transcription factors to TPL/TPR proteins. The identification of effector proteins possessing a DLNxxP motif in different fungal species with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic lifestyles together with the validation of the interaction between such effectors from Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae), Sporisorium scitamineum (S. scitamineum), and S. reilianum with TPL proteins indicates the convergent evolution of effectors for modulating the TPL/TPR co-repressor hub.",

    "abstract": "Prediction and discovery of disease-causing genes are among the main missions of biology and medicine. In recent years, researchers have developed several methods based on gene/protein networks for the detection of causative genes. However, because of the presence of false positives in these networks, the results of these methods often lack accuracy and reliability. This problem can be solved by using multiple genomic sources to reduce noise in data. However, network integration can also affect the quality of the integrated network. In this paper, we present a method named RWRHN (random walk with restart on a heterogeneous network) with fuzzy fusion or RWRHN-FF. In this method, first, four gene-gene similarity networks are constructed based on different genomic sources and then integrated using the type-II fuzzy voter scheme. The resulting gene-gene network is then linked to a disease-disease similarity network, which itself is constructed by the integration of four sources, through a two-part disease-gene network. The product of this process is a reliable heterogeneous network, which is analyzed by the RWRHN algorithm. The results of the analysis with the leave-one-out cross-validation method show that RWRHN-FF outperforms both RWRHN and RWRH. The proposed method is used to predict new genes for prostate, breast, gastric and colon cancers. To reduce the algorithm run time, Apache Spark is used as a platform for parallel execution of the RWRHN algorithm on heterogeneous networks. In the test conducted on heterogeneous networks of different sizes, this solution results in faster convergence than other non-distributed modes of implementations.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria accumulate small, organic compounds, called compatible solutes, via uptake from the environment or biosynthesis from available precursors to maintain the turgor pressure of the cell in response to osmotic stress. Vibrio parahaemolyticus has biosynthesis pathways for the compatible solutes ectoine (ectABCasp_ect) and glycine betaine (betIBAproXWV), four betaine-carnitine-choline transporters (bcct1-bcct4) and a second ProU transporter (proVWX). Most of these systems are induced in high salt. CosR, a MarR-type regulator, which is divergently transcribed from bcct3, was previously shown to be a direct repressor of ectABCasp_ect in Vibrio species. In this study, we investigated the role of CosR in glycine betaine biosynthesis and compatible solute transporter gene regulation. Expression analyses demonstrated that betIBAproXWV, bcct1, bcct3, and proVWX are repressed in low salinity. Examination of an in-frame cosR deletion mutant shows induced expression of these systems in the mutant at low salinity compared to wild-type. DNA binding assays demonstrate that purified CosR binds directly to the regulatory region of each system. In Escherichia coli GFP reporter assays, we demonstrate that CosR directly represses transcription of betIBAproXWV, bcct3, and proVWX. Similar to V. harveyi, we show betIBAproXWV is positively regulated by the LuxR homolog OpaR. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrates that CosR is widespread within the genus, present in over 50 species. In several species, the cosR homolog was clustered with the betIBAproXWV operon, which again suggests the importance of this regulator in glycine betaine biosynthesis. Incidentally, in four Aliivibrio species that contain ectoine biosynthesis genes, we identified another MarR-type regulator, ectR, clustered with these genes, which suggests the presence of a novel ectoine regulator. Homologs of EctR in this genomic context were present in A. fischeri, A. finisterrensis, A. sifiae and A. wodanis.\n\nImportanceVibrio parahaemolyticus can accumulate compatible solutes via biosynthesis and transport, which allow the cell to survive in high salinity conditions. There is little need for compatible solutes under low salinity conditions, and biosynthesis and transporter systems are repressed. However, the mechanism of this repression is not fully elucidated. CosR plays a major role in the repression of multiple compatible solute systems in V. parahaemolyticus as a direct negative regulator of ectoine and glycine betaine biosynthesis systems and four transporters. Homology analysis suggests that CosR functions in this manner in many other Vibrio species. In Aliivibrio species, we identified a new MarR family regulator EctR that clusters with the ectoine biosynthesis genes.",

    "abstract": "Predicting biomedical outcomes from Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning. Yet most of the literature is concerned with classification of outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the subject-level, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing well even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: supervised spatial filtering is practical for event-level prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning.",

    "abstract": "Microsomal cytochrome b5 (cytb5) is a membrane-bound protein capable of donating the second electron to cytochrome P450s (CYP P450s) in the CYP P450s monooxygenase reactions. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the transmembrane domain of cytb5 in the interaction with cytP450 by stabilizing its monomeric structure. While recent NMR studies have provided high-resolution insights into the structural interactions between the soluble domains of ~16-kDa cytb5 and ~57-kDa cytP450 in a membrane environment, there is need for studies to probe the residues in the transmembrane region as well as to obtain intermolecular distance constraints to better understand the very large size cytb5-cytP450 complex structure in a near native membrane environment. In this study, we report the expression, purification, functional reconstitution of 19F-labeled full-length rabbit cytb5 in peptide based nanodiscs for structural studies using NMR spectroscopy. Size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and NMR experiments show a stable reconstitution of cytb5 in 4F peptide-based lipid-nanodiscs. Our results demonstrate that the use of peptide-nanodiscs containing cytb5 19F-labeled with 5-fluorotryptophan (5FW) enables, for the first time, the detection of residues from the transmembrane domain in different lipid compositions by solution 19F NMR experiments. 19F NMR results revealing the interaction of the transmembrane domain of cytb5 with the full-length rabbit Cytochrome P450 2B4 (CYP2B4) are also presented. We expect the results presented in this study to be useful to devise approaches to probe the structure, dynamics and functional roles of transmembrane domains of a membrane protein, and also to measure intermolecular 19F-19F distance constraints to determine the structural interactions between the transmembrane domains.",

Novel functions of SparK include averaging of replicates, plotting standard deviation tracks, and highlighting significantly changed areas. SparK is written in Python 3, making it executable on any major OS platform. Using command line prompts to generate figures allows later changes to be made very easy. For instance, if the genomic region of the plot needs to be changed, or tracks need to be added or removed, the figure can easily be re-generated within seconds without the manual process of re-exporting and re-assembling everything. After plotting with SparK, changes to the output SVG vector graphic files are simple to make, including text, lines, and colors.

Here, we unveil the magnitude and macro-economic relevance of parallel biodiversity-induced productivity growth in non-rice crops from 1918 to 2018. We empirically demonstrate how biological control (BC) defused invasive pest threats in multiple agricultural commodities, ensuring annually-accruing (on-farm) benefits of US$ 22.6 billion/year. Scientifically-guided BC permitted 73-100% yield-loss recovery in critical food, feed and fiber crops including cassava, banana, breadfruit and coconut. As such, BC promoted rural growth and prosperity even in marginal, poorly-endowed, non-rice environments.

While homologous recombination-based recombineering methods have streamlined the efficient integration of protein tags onto BAC transgenes, generating precise point mutations has remained less efficient and time-consuming. Here we present a simplified method for inserting point mutations into BAC transgenes requiring a single recombineering step followed by antibiotic selection. This technique, which we call ESI (Exogenous/Synthetic Intronization) mutagenesis, relies on co-integration of a mutation of interest along with a selectable marker gene, the latter of which is harboured in an artificial intron adjacent to the mutation site. Cell lines generated from ESI-mutated BACs express the transgenes equivalently to the endogenous gene, and all cells efficiently splice out the synthetic intron.

While conventional MRI has been widely adopted for examining GBM clinically, accurate neuroimaging assessment of tumor histopathology for improved diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment evaluation, remains an unmet need in the clinical management of GBMs.\n\nExperimental DesignWe employ a novel Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) approach, combining diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) and machine learning, to detect, differentiate, and quantify areas of high cellularity, tumor necrosis, and tumor infiltration in GBM.\n\nResultsGd-enhanced T1W or hyper-intense FLAIR failed to reflect the morphological complexity underlying tumor in GBM patients. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) negatively correlates with increased tumor cellularity, we demonstrate disagreement between ADC and histologically confirmed tumor cellularity in glioblastoma specimens, whereas DBSI-derived restricted isotropic diffusion fraction positively correlated with tumor cellularity in the same specimens. By incorporating DBSI metrics as classifiers for a supervised machine learning algorithm, we accurately predicted high tumor cellularity, tumor necrosis, and tumor infiltration with 87.5%, 89.0% and 93.4% accuracy, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that DHI could serve as a favorable alternative to current neuroimaging techniques for guiding biopsy or surgery as well as monitoring therapeutic response in the treatment of glioblastoma.\n\nTranslational RelevanceCurrent clinical diagnosis, surgical planning, and assessment of treatment response for GBM patients relies heavily on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which is non-specific for tumor growth and merely reflects a disrupted blood-brain barrier. The complex tumor microenvironment and spatial heterogeneity make GBM difficult to characterize using current clinical imaging modalities. In this study, we developed a novel imaging technique to characterize and accurately predict key histological features of GBM - high tumor cellularity, tumor necrosis, and tumor infiltration. While further validation in a larger cohort of patients is needed, the current proof-of-concept approach could provide a solution to resolve important clinical questions such as the identification of true tumor progression vs. pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis.",

This study aims to identify the characteristics of functional connectivity (FC) elicited by different saltatory velocities over the perioral and buccal surface of the lower face using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in twenty neurotypical adults. Our results showed 25 cm/s evoked more functional coupling in the right hemisphere, suggesting 25 cm/s might be optimal velocity if bilateral brain damages occur. The decreased FC between the right secondary somatosensory cortex and right posterior parietal cortex for 5 cm/s versus All-on showed that the relatively slow velocity evoked less coupling in the ipsilateral hemisphere, which suggesting functional coupling in the contralateral hemisphere is in charge of orofacial tactile perception of velocity. The increased FC between the right thalamus and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex for 65 cm/s versus All-on indicated that the neural encoding of relatively fast tactile velocity is more coupling between the right thalamus and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex. Our results have shown different characteristics of FC for each seed at various velocity contrasts (5 > 25 cm/s, 5 > 65 cm/s, and 25 > 65 cm/s), suggesting the neuronal networks encoding the orofacial tactile perception of velocity.

    "abstract": "The olfactory system is uniquely heterogeneous, performing multifaceted functions (beyond basic sensory processing) across diverse, widely distributed neural substrates. While knowledge of human olfaction continues to grow, it remains unclear how the olfactory network is organized to serve this unique set of functions. Leveraging a large and high-quality resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dataset of nearly 900 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identified a human olfactory network encompassing cortical and subcortical regions across the temporal and frontal lobes. Highlighting its reliability and generalizability, the connectivity matrix of this olfactory network mapped closely onto that extracted from an independent rs-fMRI dataset. Graph theoretical analysis further explicated the organizational principles of the network. The olfactory network exhibits a functionally advantageous modular composition of three (i.e., the sensory, limbic, and frontal) subnetworks and demonstrates strong small-world properties, high in both global integration and local segregation (i.e., circuit specialization). This network organization thus ensures the segregation of local circuits, which are nonetheless integrated via connecting hubs (i.e., amygdala and anterior insula), thereby enabling the specialized, yet integrative, functions of olfaction. In particular, the degree of local segregation positively predicted olfactory discrimination performance in the independent sample. In sum, an olfactory functional network has been identified through the large HCP dataset, affording a representative template of the human olfactory functional neuroanatomy. Importantly, the topological analysis of the olfactory network provides network-level insights into the remarkable functional specialization and spatial segregation of the olfactory system.\n\nSignificance StatementOlfaction is an intriguing multifunctional system, playing key roles in regulating emotions, autonomic tone, and feeding, beyond basic sensory perception. However, it is unclear how the neuroanatomy of olfaction is organized in humans to subserve these functions. Functional connectivity analysis of the HCP dataset combined with graph theoretical analysis revealed an optimized large-scale network consisting of three subnetworks--the sensory, limbic, and frontal subnetworks. Distributed across frontal and temporal lobes in well segregated fashion, these olfactory structures are also highly integrated, linked through hub nodes of the amygdala and anterior insula. Our independent dataset replicated the HCP-derived olfactory network and, importantly, highlighted a direct association between the degree of network segregation and olfactory perception.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the underlying physiological mechanism of muscle synergies, we investigated the functional corticomuscular and intermuscular binding during an isometric upper limb task in 14 healthy participants. Cortical activity was recorded using 32-channel encephalography (EEG) and muscle activity using 16-channel electromyography (EMG). Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), we calculated muscle synergies from two different tasks. A preliminary multidirectional task was used to identify synergy preferred directions. A subsequent coherence task, consisting of generating forces isometrically in the synergy PDs, was used to assess the functional connectivity properties of synergies. Functional connectivity was estimated using corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and intermuscular coherence (IMC). Overall, we were able to extract four different synergies from the multidirectional task. A significant alpha band IMC was present consistently in all extracted synergies. Moreover, alpha band IMC was higher between muscles with higher weights within a synergy. In contrast, no significant CMC was found between the motor cortex area and synergy muscles. In addition, there is a relationship between a synergy muscle weight and the level of IMC. Our findings suggest the existence of a consistent shared input between muscles of each synergy. Finally, the existence of a shared input onto synergistic muscles within a synergy supports the idea of neurally-derived muscle synergies that build human movement.",

    "abstract": "The polymyxins are last-line defense for highly resistant infections. Nephrotoxicity, however, is a dose-limiting factor. Yet, approaches to mitigate nephrotoxicity are poorly defined. This study aimed to investigate the impact of dose fractionated (once, twice and thrice daily) polymyxin B (PB) on acute kidney injury (AKI) in a pre-clinical model. Secondarily, we aimed to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of PB. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to experimental groups with different dosing intervals but constant total daily exposure (12 mg/kg/day into single, twice daily, and thrice daily doses) and controls received normal saline subcutaneously over 3 days. Blood and urine samples were collected, and kidneys were harvested at necropsy. A three-compartment model best described the data and Bayesian observed vs. predicted concentration demonstrated bias, imprecision, and R2 of 0.129 mg/L, 0.729 mg2/L2 and 0.652, respectively. PB exposure (i.e. AUC24h) were similar across treatment groups over time (p=0.87). As a representative, urinary KIM-1 were elevated on days 1 and 2 for experimental groups compared to controls, and thrice daily group experienced the most KIM-1 increase [mean increase (95% CI) day 1 from day -1, 4.44 (0.89, 8.00) ng/mL; p=0.018] as compared to control [mean increase (95% CI) day 1 from day -1, 0.03 (-0.42, 0.49) ng/mL; p=0.99]. Correspondingly, significant histopathological damage was observed with the same group (p=0.013) (controls as a referent). Our findings suggested that fractionating the PB dose thrice daily resulted in the most injury in a rat model.",

    "abstract": "When heated, insects loose coordinated movement followed by the onset of heat coma (CTmax). These phenotypes are popular measures to quantify inter- and intraspecific differences in insect heat tolerance, and CTmax correlate well with current species distributions. Here we examined the function of the central nervous system (CNS) in five species of Drosophila with different heat tolerances, while they were exposed to either constant high temperature or a gradual increasing temperature (ramp). Tolerant species were able to preserve CNS function at higher temperatures and for longer durations than sensitive species and similar differences were found for the behavioral indices (loss of coordination and onset of heat coma). Furthermore, the timing and temperature (constant and ramp exposure, respectively) for loss of coordination or complete coma coincided with the occurrence of spreading depolarisation (SD) events in the CNS. These SD events disrupt neurological function and silence the CNS suggesting that CNS failure is the primary cause of impaired coordination and heat coma. Heat mortality occurs soon after heat coma in insects and to examine if CNS failure could also be the proximal cause of heat death, we used selective heating of the head (CNS) and abdomen (visceral tissues). When comparing the temperature causing 50% mortality (LT50) of each body part to that of the whole animal, we found that the head was not particularly heat sensitive compared to the abdomen. Accordingly, it is unlikely that nervous failure is the principal/proximate cause of heat mortality in Drosophila.\n\nSummary statementHyperthermic failure of the Drosophila central nervous system causes heat coma, a phenotype varying in temperature between drosophilids, but neural failure is likely not the primary cause of heat mortality.",

However, optogenetics offers unique capabilities such as easy tunability, reversibility, dynamic induction strength, and spatial control that are difficult to obtain with chemical inducers. We developed an optogenetic lac operon in a series of circuits we call OptoLAC. With these circuits, we control gene expression from various IPTG-inducible promoters using only blue light. Applying them to metabolic engineering improves mevalonate and isobutanol production by 24% and 27% respectively, compared to IPTG induction, in light-controlled fermentations scalable to at least 2L bioreactors. Furthermore, OptoLAC circuits enable light control of recombinant protein production, reaching yields comparable to IPTG induction, but with enhanced tunability of expression and spatial control. OptoLAC circuits are potentially useful to confer light controls over other cell functions originally engineered to be IPTG-inducible.",

    "abstract": "1.Genetically encoded reporters have greatly increased our understanding of biology, especially in neuroscience. While fluorescent reporters have been widely used, photostability and phototoxicity have hindered their use in long-term experiments. Bioluminescence overcomes some of these challenges but requires the addition of an exogenous luciferin limiting its use. Using a modular approach we have engineered Autonomous Molecular BioluminEscent Reporter (AMBER), an indicator of membrane potential. Unlike other luciferase-luciferin bioluminescent systems, AMBER encodes the genes to express both the luciferase and luciferin. AMBER is a voltage-gated luciferase coupling the functionalities of the Ciona voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and bacterial luciferase, luxAB. When AMBER is co-expressed with the luciferin producing genes it reversibly switches the bioluminescent intensity as a function of membrane potential. Using biophysical and biochemical methods we show that AMBER modulates its enzymatic activity as a function of the membrane potential. AMBER shows several-fold increase in the luminescent ({Delta}L/L) signal upon switching from the off to on state when the cell is depolarized. In vivo expression of AMBER in C. elegans allowed detecting pharyngeal pumping action and mechanosensory neural activity from multiple worms simultaneously. AMBER reports neural activity of multiple animals at the same time and can be used in social behavior assays to elucidate the role of membrane potential underlying behavior.\n\n2. Significance StatementThere have been many exciting advances in the development of genetically encoded voltage indicators to monitor intracelluar voltage changes. Most sensors employ fluorescence, which requires external light, potentially causing photobleaching or overheating. Consequently, there has been interest in developing luminescence reporters. However, they require addition of an exogenous substrate to produce light intracellularly. Here, we engineered a genetically encoded bioluminescent voltage indicator, AMBER, which unlike other bioluminescent activity indicators, does not require addition of an exogenous substrate. AMBER allows a large differential signal, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and causes minimal metabolic demand on cells. We used AMBER to record voltage activity in freely-moving C. elegans, demonstrating that AMBER is a important new tool for monitoring neuronal activity during social behavior.",

    "abstract": "A density modification procedure for improving maps produced by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy is presented. The theoretical basis of the method is identical to that of maximum-likelihood density modification, previously used to improve maps from macromolecular X-ray crystallography. Two key differences from applications in crystallography are that the errors in Fourier coefficients are largely in the phases in crystallography but in both phases and amplitudes in electron cryo-microscopy, and that half-maps with independent errors are available in electron cryo-microscopy. These differences lead to a distinct approach for combination of information from starting maps with information obtained in the density modification process. The applicability of density modification theory to electron cryo-microscopy was evaluated using half-maps for apoferritin at a resolution of 3.1 [A] and a matched 1.8 [A] reference map. Error estimates for the map obtained by density modification were found to closely agree with true errors as estimated by comparison with the reference map. The density modification procedure was applied to a set of 104 datasets where half-maps, a full map and a model all had been deposited. The procedure improved map-model correlation and increased the visibility of details in the maps. The procedure requires two unmasked half-maps and a sequence file or other source of information on the volume of the macromolecule that has been imaged.",

Relieving the glucose inhibition of {beta}-glucosidase is a significant challenge. Towards the goal of understanding how glucose interacts with {beta}-glucosidase, we expressed in Escherichia coli, the Hore_15280 gene encoding a {beta}-glucosidase in Halothermothrix orenii. Our results show that the enzyme is glucose tolerant, and its activity stimulated in the presence of up to 0.5 M glucose. NMR analyses show the unexpected interactions between glucose and the {beta}-glucosidase at lower concentrations of glucose that however does not lead to enzyme inhibition. We identified non-conserved residues at the aglycone-binding and the gatekeeper site and show that increased hydrophobicity at the pocket entrance and a reduction in steric hindrances are critical towards enhanced substrate accessibility and significant improvement in activity. Analysis of structures and in combination with molecular dynamics simulations show that glucose increases the accessibility of the substrate by enhancing the structural flexibility of the active site pocket and may explain the stimulation in specific activity up to 0.5 M glucose. Such novel regulation of {beta}-glucosidase activity by its reaction product may offer novel ways of engineering glucose tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Detection of protein structure similarity is a central challenge in structural bioinformatics. Comparisons are usually performed at the polypeptide chain level, however the functional form of a protein within the cell is often an oligomer. This fact, together with recent growth of oligomeric structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), demands more efficient approaches to oligomeric assembly alignment/retrieval. Traditional methods use atom level information, which can be complicated by the presence of topological permutations within a polypeptide chain and/or subunit rearrangements. These challenges can be overcome by comparing electron density volumes directly. But, brute force alignment of 3D data is a compute intensive search problem. We developed a 3D Zernike moment normalization procedure to orient electron density volumes and assess similarity with unprecedented speed. Similarity searching with this approach enables real-time retrieval of proteins/protein assemblies resembling a target, from PDB or user input, together with resulting alignments (http://shape.rcsb.org).\n\nAuthor SummaryProtein structures possess wildly varied shapes, but patterns at different levels are frequently reused by nature. Finding and classifying these similarities is fundamental to understand evolution. Given the continued growth in the number of known protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, the task of comparing them to find the common patterns is becoming increasingly complicated. This is especially true when considering complete protein assemblies with several polypeptide chains, where the large sizes further complicate the issue. Here we present a novel method that can detect similarity between protein shapes and that works equally fast for any size of proteins or assemblies. The method looks at proteins as volumes of density distribution, departing from what is more usual in the field: similarity assessment based on atomic coordinates and chain connectivity. A volumetric function is amenable to be decomposed with a mathematical tool known as 3D Zernike polynomials, resulting in a compact description as vectors of Zernike moments. The tool was introduced in the 1990s, when it was suggested that the moments could be normalized to be invariant to rotations without losing information. Here we demonstrate that in fact this normalization is possible and that it offers a much more accurate method for assessing similarity between shapes, when compared to previous attempts.",

    "abstract": "Neuroanatomical segmentation in T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is a prerequisite for quantitative morphological measurements, as well as an essential element in general pre-processing pipelines. While recent fully automated segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks have shown great potential, these methods nonetheless suffer from severe performance degradation when there are mismatches between training (source) and testing (target) domains (e.g. due to different scanner acquisition protocols or due to anatomical differences in the respective populations under study). This work introduces a new method for unsupervised domain adaptation which improves performance in challenging cross-domain applications without requiring any additional annotations on the target domain. Using a previously validated state-of-the-art segmentation method based on a context-augmented convolutional neural network, we first demonstrate that networks with better domain generalizability can be trained using extensive data augmentation with label-preserving transformations which mimic differences between domains. Second, we incorporate unlabelled target domain samples into training using a self-ensembling approach, demonstrating further performance gains, and further diminishing the performance gap in comparison to fully-supervised training on the target domain.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are well known to participate in regeneration and maintenance of the tissue over time. Studies have shown increases in the number of satellite cells after exercise, but their functional role in endurance training remains unexplored. Here, we found that injured muscles from endurance-exercised mice display improved regenerative capacity, demonstrated through higher densities of newly formed myofibers compared to controls, as well as lower inflammation and fibrosis. Enhanced myogenic function was accompanied by an increased fraction of satellite cells expressing self-renewal markers. Control satellite cells had morphologies suggestive of early differentiation, while endurance exercise enhanced myogenic colony formation. The beneficial effects of endurance exercise were associated with satellite cell metabolic reprogramming, including reduced mitochondrial respiration (O2 consumption) under resting conditions (absence of muscle injury) and increased stemness. During proliferation or activated states (three days after injury), O2 consumption was equal in control and exercised cells. Surprisingly, inhibition of mitochondrial O2 consumption was sufficient to enhance muscle stem cell self-renewal characteristics in vitro. Moreover, transplanted muscle satellite cells from exercised mice or cells with reduced mitochondrial respiration promoted a significant reduction in inflammation compared to controls. We propose that endurance exercise promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation in satellite cells, an effect promoted by metabolic reprogramming and respiratory inhibition, and which is associated with a more favorable muscular response to injury.",

Do ten eukaryotic model organisms differ in their location spectrum, i.e. the fraction of its proteome in each of its seven major compartments? As experimental annotations of locations remain biased and incomplete, we need prediction methods to answer this question. To gauge the bias of prediction methods, we merged all available experimental annotations for the human proteome. In doing so, we found important values in both Swiss-Prot and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). After systematic bias corrections, the complete but faulty prediction methods appeared to be more appropriate to compare location spectra between species than the incomplete more accurate experimental data. This work compared the location spectra for ten eukaryotes: Homo sapiens, Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabitis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Overall, the predicted location spectra were similar. However, the detailed differences were significant enough to plot trees and 2D (PCA) maps relating the ten organisms using a simple Euclidean distance in seven states, corresponding to the seven studied localization classes. The relations based on the simple predicted location spectra captured aspects of cross-species comparisons usually revealed only by much more detailed evolutionary comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Successful reproduction depends on interactions between numerous proteins beyond those involved directly in gamete fusion. While such reproductive proteins evolve in response to sexual selection pressures, how networks of interacting proteins arise and evolve as reproductive phenotypes change remains an open question. Here, we investigated the molecular evolution of the \"sex peptide network\" of Drosophila melanogaster, a functionally well-characterized reproductive protein network. In this species, the peptide hormone sex peptide (SP) and its interacting proteins cause major changes in female physiology and behavior after mating. In contrast, females of more distantly related Drosophila species do not respond to SP. In spite of these phenotypic differences, we detected orthologs of all network proteins across 22 diverse Drosophila species and found evidence that most orthologs likely function in reproduction throughout the genus. Within SP-responsive species, we detected the recurrent, adaptive evolution of several network proteins, consistent with sexual selection acting to continually refine network function. We also found some evidence for adaptive evolution of several proteins along two specific phylogenetic lineages that correspond with increased expression of the SP receptor in female reproductive tracts or increased sperm length, respectively. Finally, we used gene expression profiling to examine the likely degree of functional conservation of the paralogs of an SP network protein that arose via gene duplication. Our results suggest a dynamic history for the SP network in which network members arose before the onset of robust SP-mediated responses and then were shaped by both purifying and positive selection.",

Using the result of the meta-analysis, we derived a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD, which outperformed those derived from either Japanese or European GWAS. The PRS prioritized risk factors among various clinical parameters and segregated individuals with increased risk of long-term cardiovascular mortality. Our data improves clinical characterization of CAD genetics and suggests the utility of transethnic meta-analysis for PRS derivation in non-European populations.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the diffraction limit and resolve target structures in greater detail, far-field super-resolution techniques such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) have been developed, and different STORM algorithms have been developed to deal with the various problems that arise. In particular, the effect of local structure is an important issue. For objects with closely correlated distributions, simple Gaussian-based localization algorithms often used in STORM imaging misinterpret overlapping point spread functions (PSFs) as one and this limits the ability of super-resolution imaging to resolve nanoscale local structures and leading to inaccurate length measurements. In the present study, we proposed a novel, structure-based, super-resolution image analysis method: structure-based analysis (SBA), which combines a structural function and a super-resolution localization algorithm. Using SBA, we estimated the size of fluorescent beads, inclusion proteins, and subtle synaptic structures in both wide-field and STORM images. The results showed that SBA has comparable and often superior performance to commonly used full-width-at-half-maximum parameters. We also demonstrated that SBA provides size estimations that corroborate previously published electron microscopy data.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens pose a serious public health threat, especially in hospital settings. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) contributes to this threat by facilitating the rapid spread of genes conferring antibiotic resistance, enhanced virulence, and environmental persistence between nosocomial pathogens. Despite recent advances in microbial genomics, studies of HGT in hospital settings remain limited in scope. The objective of this study was to identify and track the movement of MGEs within a single hospital system using unbiased methods. We screened the genomes of 2,173 bacterial isolates from healthcare-associated infections collected over an 18-month time period to identify nucleotide regions that were identical in the genomes of bacteria belonging to distinct genera. These putative MGEs were found in 196 isolates belonging to 11 different genera; they grouped into 51 clusters of related elements, and they were most often shared between related genera. To resolve the genomic locations of the most prevalent MGEs, we performed long-read sequencing on a subset of representative isolates and generated highly contiguous, hybrid-assembled genomes. Many of these genomes contained plasmids and chromosomal elements encoding one or more of the MGEs we identified, which were often arranged in a mosaic fashion. We then tracked the appearance of ten MGE-bearing plasmids in all 2,173 genomes, and found evidence supporting the transfer of plasmids between patients independent from bacterial transmission. Finally, we identified two instances of likely plasmid transfer across genera within individual patients. In one instance, the plasmid appeared to have subsequently transferred to a second patient. By surveying a large number of bacterial genomes sampled from infections at a single hospital in a systematic and unbiased manner, we were able to track the independent transfer of MGEs over time. This work expands our understanding of HGT in healthcare settings, and can inform efforts to limit the spread of drug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.",
