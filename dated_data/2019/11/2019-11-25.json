    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is emerging as a powerful technology to examine transcriptomes of individual cells. We determined whether scRNA-seq could be used to detect the effect of environmental and pharmacologic perturbations on osteoblasts. We began with a commonly used in vitro system in which freshly isolated neonatal mouse calvarial cells are expanded and induced to produce a mineralized matrix. We used scRNA-seq to compare the relative cell type abundances and the transcriptomes of freshly isolated cells to those that had been cultured for 12 days in vitro. We observed that the percentage of macrophage-like cells increased from 6% in freshly isolated calvarial cells to 34% in cultured cells. We also found that Bglap transcripts were abundant in freshly isolated osteoblasts but nearly undetectable in the cultured calvarial cells. Thus, scRNA-seq revealed significant differences between heterogeneity of cells in vivo and in vitro. We next performed scRNA-seq on freshly recovered long bone endocortical cells from mice that received either vehicle or Sclerostin-neutralizing antibody for 1 week. Bone anabolism-associated transcripts were also not significantly increased in immature and mature osteoblasts recovered from Sclerostin-neutralizing antibody treated mice; this is likely a consequence of being underpowered to detect modest changes in gene expression, since only 7% of the sequenced endocortical cells were osteoblasts, and a limited portion of their transcriptomes were sampled. We conclude that scRNA-seq can detect changes in cell abundance, identity, and gene expression in skeletally derived cells. In order to detect modest changes in osteoblast gene expression at the single cell level in the appendicular skeleton, larger numbers of osteoblasts from endocortical bone are required.",

    "abstract": "The body plan along the anteroposterior axis and regional identities are specified by the spatiotemporal expression of Hox genes. Multistep controls are required for their unique expression patterns; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the tight control of Hox genes are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the Lin28a/let-7 reciprocal regulatory pathway is critical for vertebral specification. Lin28a-/- mice exhibited homeotic transformations of vertebrae which were caused by the global dysregulation of posterior Hox genes. The accumulation of let-7-family microRNAs in Lin28a-/- mice resulted in the reduction of PRC1 occupancy at the Hox cluster loci by targeting Cbx2. Consistently, Lin28a loss in embryonic stem-like cells led to aberrant induction of posterior Hox genes, which was rescued by the knockdown of let-7-family microRNAs. These results suggest that Lin28/let-7 pathway is possibly involved in the modulation of the \"Hox code\" via Polycomb regulation during axial patterning in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Clefts of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) are common anomalies that occur in 1/800 live births. Pathogenic SPECC1L variants identified in patients with rare atypical clefts and syndromic CL/P suggest the gene plays a primary role in face and palate development. We have generated Specc1l gene-trap (Specc1lcGT) and truncation (Specc1l{Delta}C510) alleles that cause embryonic or perinatal lethality, respectively. Specc1lcGT/{Delta}C510 compound mutants show delayed and abnormal palatal shelf elevation at E14.5. By E15.5, the mutant shelves do elevate and fuse, however, the palatal rugae form abnormally. Palatogenesis requires extensive mesenchymal remodeling, especially during palatal shelf elevation. We posit that this remodeling involves collective movement of neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme cells. Live time-lapse microscopy was performed to visualize in vitro wound-repair assays with wildtype and SPECC1L-deficient primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells. SPECC1L-deficient MEPM cells consistently showed delayed closure in wound-repair assays. To evaluate which features of cellular movement were responsible, we performed automated particle image velocimetry (PIV) and manual cell tracking. The analyses revealed that both cell speed and directionality are disrupted in SPECC1L-deficient cells compared to controls. To determine if primary MEPM cells can move collectively, we assayed stream formation, which is a hallmark of collective movement. Indeed, MEPM cultures displayed correlated movement of neighboring cells. Importantly, correlation length was reduced in SPECC1L-deficient cultures, consistent with a role for SPECC1L in collective migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway with the 740Y-P small molecule can rescue the wound-closure delay in SPECC1L-deficient MEPM cells. Cell tracking analyses showed that this rescue was due to both increased speed and improved directionality. Altogether, our data showed a novel role for SPECC1L in guided movement through modulation of PI3K-AKT signaling.",

    "abstract": "The appearance of genetic changes in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) presents a concern for their use in research and regenerative medicine. Variant hPSCs harbouring recurrent culture-acquired aneuploidies display growth advantages over wild-type diploid cells, but the mechanisms yielding a drift from predominantly wild-type to variant cell populations remain poorly understood. Here we show that the dominance of variant clones in mosaic cultures is enhanced through competitive interactions resulting in elimination of wild-type cells. This elimination occurs through corralling and mechanical compression by faster growing variants, causing a redistribution of F-actin and sequestration of YAP in the cytoplasm that induces apoptosis in wild-type cells. Importantly, YAP overexpression in wild-type cells is sufficient to alleviate their loser phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hPSC fate is coupled to mechanical cues imposed by neighbouring cells and reveal that hijacking this mechanism allows variants to achieve clonal dominance in cultures.",

    "abstract": "The jellyfish species Clytia hemisphaerica (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) has emerged as a new experimental model animal in the last decade. Favorable characters include a fully transparent body suitable for microscopy, daily gamete production and a relatively short life cycle. Furthermore, whole genome sequence assembly and efficient gene editing techniques using CRISPR/Cas9 have opened new possibilities for genetic studies. The quasi-immortal vegetatively-growing polyp colony stage provides a practical means to maintain mutant strains. In the context of developing Clytia as a genetic model, we report here an improved whole life cycle culture method including an aquarium tank system designed for culture of the tiny jellyfish form. We have compared different feeding regimes using Artemia larvae as the food and demonstrate that the stage-dependent feeding control is the key for rapid and reliable medusa and polyp rearing. Metamorphosis of the planula larvae into a polyp colony can be efficiently induced using a new synthetic peptide. The optimized procedures detailed here make it practical to generate new genetically modified Clytia strains and to safely maintain their whole life cycle in the laboratory.",

    "abstract": "The FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex, mutated in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) cancer predisposition syndrome, is required for the repair of replication forks stalled at DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) and related lesions1. The FA pathway is activated when two replication forks converge onto an ICL2, triggering the mono-ubiquitination of the ID complex. ID mono-ubiquitination is essential for ICL repair by excision, translesion synthesis and homologous recombination, but its function was hitherto unknown1,3. Here, the 3.48 [A] cryo-EM structure of mono-ubiquitinated ID (IDUb) bound to DNA reveals that it forms a closed ring that encircles the DNA. Compared to the cryo-EM structure of the non-ubiquitinated ID complex bound to ICL DNA, described here as well, mono-ubiquitination triggers a complete re-arrangement of the open, trough-like ID structure through the ubiquitin of one protomer binding to the other protomer in a reciprocal fashion. The structures, in conjunction with biochemical data, indicate the mono-ubiquitinated ID complex looses its preference for ICL and related branched DNA structures, becoming a sliding DNA clamp that can coordinate the subsequent repair reactions. Our findings also reveal how mono-ubiquitination in general can induce an alternate structure with a new function.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein (pTau) in the entorhinal cortex (EC) is the earliest tau pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD). Tau tubulin kinase-1 (TTBK1) is a neuron-specific tau kinase and expressed in the EC and hippocampal regions in both human and mouse brains. Here we report that collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), a critical mediator of growth cone collapse, is a new downstream target of TTBK1 and is accumulated in the EC region of early stage AD brains. TTBK1 transgenic mice show severe axonal degeneration in the perforant path, which is exacerbated by crossing with Tg2576 mice expressing Swedish familial AD mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APP). TTBK1 mice show accumulation of phosphorylated CRMP2 (pCRMP2), in the EC at 10 months of age, whereas age-matched APP/TTBK1 bigenic mice show pCRMP2 accumulation in both the EC and hippocampal regions. Amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) and TTBK1 suppresses the kinetics of microtubule polymerization and TTBK1 reduces the neurite length of primary cultured neurons in Rho kinase-dependent manner in vitro. Silencing of TTBK1 or expression of dominant-negative Rho kinase demonstrates that A{beta} induces CRMP2 phosphorylation at threonine 514 in a TTBK1-dependent manner, and TTBK1 enhances A{beta}-induced CRMP2 phosphorylation in Rho kinase-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, TTBK1 expression induces pCRMP2 complex formation with pTau in vitro, which is enhanced upon A{beta} stimulation in vitro. Finally, pCRMP2 forms a complex with pTau in the EC tissue of TTBK1 mice in vivo, which is exacerbated in both the EC and hippocampal tissues in APP/TTBK1 mice. These results suggest that TTBK1 and A{beta} synergistically induce phosphorylation of CRMP2, which may be causative for the neurite degeneration and somal accumulation of pTau in the EC neurons, indicating critical involvement of TTBK1 and pCRMP2 in the early AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "To maintain proper ploidy, haploid sex cells must undergo two subsequent meiotic divisions. During meiosis I, homologs pair and remain conjoined until segregation at anaphase. Drosophila melanogaster spermatocytes are unique in that the canonical events of meiosis I including synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, double-strand DNA breaks, and chiasmata are absent. Sex chromosomes pair at intergenic spacer sequences within the heterochromatic rDNA while euchromatin is required to pair and segregate autosomal homologies, suggesting that pairing may be limited to specific sequences. However, previous work generated from genetic segregation assays or observations of late prophase I/prometaphase I chromosome associations fail to differentiate pairing from conjunction. Here, we separately examined the capability of X euchromatin to pair and conjoin using an rDNA-deficient X and a series of Dp(1;Y) chromosomes. Genetic assays showed that duplicated X euchromatin can substitute for endogenous rDNA pairing sites. Segregation was not proportional to homology length, and pairing could be mapped to nonoverlapping sequences within a single Dp(1;Y). Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to early prophase I spermatocytes, we showed that pairing occurred with high fidelity at all homologies tested. Pairing was unaffected by the presence of X rDNA, nor could it be explained by rDNA magnification. By comparing genetic and cytological data, we determined that centromere proximal pairings were best at segregation. Segregation was dependent on the conjunction protein Stromalin in Meiosis while the autosomal-specific Teflon was dispensable. Overall, our results suggest that pairing may occur at all homologies, but there may be sequence or positional requirements for conjunction.\n\nARTICLE SUMMARYDrosophila males have evolved a unique system of chromosome segregation in meiosis that lacks recombination. Chromosomes pair at selected sequences suggesting that early steps of meiosis may also differ in this organism. Using Y chromosomes carrying portions of X material, we show that pairing between sex chromosomes can be mediated by sequences other than the previously identified rDNA pairing sites. We propose that pairing may simply be homology-based and may not differ from canonical meiosis observed in females. The main difference in males may be that conjunctive mechanisms that join homologs in the absence of crossovers.",

We previously identified a composite domain in the BRG1 ATPase subunit that is capable of associating with both histones and DNA in a multivalent manner. Mapping the DNA binding pocket revealed that it contains several cancer mutations. Here, we utilize SELEX-seq to identify the DNA specificity of this composite domain and NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling to determine the structural basis of DNA binding.

However, balancing high-resolution and genome wide-coverage remains challenging. We describe a computational method for the reconstruction of large 3D-ensembles of single-cell (sc) chromatin conformations from population Hi-C that we apply to study embryogenesis in Drosophila. With minimal assumptions of physical properties and without adjustable parameters, our method generates large ensembles of chromatin conformations via deep-sampling. Our method identifies specific interactions, which constitute 5-6% of Hi-C frequencies, but surprisingly are sufficient to drive chromatin folding, giving rise to the observed Hi-C patterns. Modeled sc-chromatins quantify chromatin heterogeneity, revealing significant changes during embryogenesis. Furthermore, >50% of modeled sc-chromatin maintain topologically associating domains (TADs) in early embryos, when no population TADs are perceptible. Domain boundaries become fixated during development, with strong preference at binding-sites of insulator-complexes upon the mid-blastula transition. Overall, high-resolution 3D-ensembles of sc-chromatin conformations enable further in-depth interpretation of population Hi-C, improving understanding of the structure-function relationship of genome organization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder with high risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and language delay, and is caused by 22q13.3 deletions or mutations in the SHANK3 gene. To date, the molecular and pathway changes resulting from SHANK3 haploinsufficiency in PMS remain poorly understood. Uncovering these mechanisms is critical for understanding pathobiology of PMS and, ultimately, for the development of new therapeutic interventions.\n\nMethodsWe developed human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of PMS by reprogramming peripheral blood samples from individuals with PMS (n=7) and their unaffected siblings (n=6). For each participant, up to three hiPSC clones were generated and differentiated into induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs; n=32) and induced forebrain neurons (iNeurons; n=42). Genome-wide RNA-sequencing was applied to explore transcriptional differences between PMS probands and unaffected siblings.\n\nResultsTranscriptome analyses identified 391 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in iNPCs and 82 DEGs in iNeurons, when comparing cells from PMS probands and unaffected siblings (FDR <5%). Genes under-expressed in PMS were implicated in Wnt signaling, embryonic development and protein translation, while over-expressed genes were enriched for pre- and post-synaptic density genes, regulation of synaptic plasticity, and G-protein-gated potassium channel activity. Gene co-expression network analysis identified two modules in iNeurons that were over-expressed in PMS, implicating postsynaptic signaling and GDP binding, and both modules harbored a significant enrichment of genetic risk loci for developmental delay and intellectual disability. Finally, PMS-associated genes were integrated with other ASD iPSC transcriptome findings and several points of convergence were identified, indicating altered Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix and glutamatergic synapses.\n\nLimitationsGiven the rarity of the condition, we could not carry out experimental validation in independent biological samples. In addition, functional and morphological phenotypes caused by loss of SHANK3 were not characterized here.\n\nConclusionsThis is the largest human neural sample analyzed in PMS. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing in hiPSC-derived neural cells from individuals with PMS revealed both shared and distinct transcriptional signatures across iNPCs and iNeurons, including many genes implicated in risk for ASD, as well as specific neurobiological pathways, including the Wnt pathway.",

    "abstract": "Medical students are constantly under stress caused by strenuous medical programs, which may exert persistent physical and psychological effects on their well-being. Using medical students as a model population, this work explores the gut microbiome as a potential contributing mechanism for why individuals exposed to similar stimuli react variably. We evaluated the relationship of gut microbiome composition of first year medical students and stress resilience over a period of 4 months. Our objective was to identify gut microbiome characteristics of individuals that showed long-term stress resilience. Students were voluntarily recruited and screened for lifestyle and environmental factors at 3 timepoints during the first semester. Fecal samples were also collected at each timepoint. In order to identify candidates with stress resilience, their perceived stress and depression levels were normalized and summed to produce a psychologic index score. The most notable finding is a correlation between psychologic resiliency of Bacteriodete:Firmicute abundance as well as a relationship between durable resiliency and microbiome stability. Phylogenetic assembly of participants by microbiome relatedness found that 100% of subjects who were resilient to stress across all timepoints (n=8) were phylogenetically clustered in adjacent positions, showing a high degree of temporal stability. Of participants who were not durably resilient to stress, only 62% of participants (n=8) showed microbiomes that were phylogenetically related across the same 4 month period. We identified 2,102 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) which were unique to the durable resilience group and 94 OTUs which were unique to the susceptible group. Of the 4,794 observed OTUs, 6.1% (n=294) were significantly different between groups. These findings support that the gut microbiome may play an important role in stress resilience at a time scale of 4 months. A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in stress resilience may shed light on potential treatment to reduce stress/anxiety in general, as well as to promote wellbeing of our future health care providers and physicians.",

    "abstract": "RationaleObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors exacerbated by stress. Many OCD patients do not respond to available pharmacotherapies, but neurosurgical ablation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can provide symptomatic relief. Although the ACC receives noradrenergic innervation and expresses adrenergic receptors (ARs), the involvement of norepinephrine (NE) in OCD has not been investigated.\n\nObjectiveTo determine the effects of genetic or pharmacological disruption of NE neurotransmission on marble burying (MB) and nestlet shredding (NS) in two animal models of OCD.\n\nMethodsWe assessed NE-deficient (Dbh -/-) mice and NE-competent (Dbh +/-) controls in MB and NS tasks. We also measured the effects of anti-adrenergic drugs on NS and MB in control mice and the effects of pharmacological restoration of central NE in Dbh -/- mice. Finally, we compared c-fos induction in the locus coeruleus (LC) and ACC of Dbh -/- and control mice following both tasks.\n\nResultsDbh -/- mice virtually lacked MB and NS behaviors seen in control mice but did not differ in the elevated zero maze (EZM) model of general anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological restoration of central NE synthesis in Dbh -/- mice completely rescued NS behavior, while NS and MB were suppressed in control mice by anti-adrenergic drugs. Expression of c-fos in the ACC was attenuated in Dbh -/- mice after MB and NS.\n\nConclusionThese findings support a role for NE transmission to the ACC in the expression of stress-induced compulsive behaviors and suggest further evaluation of anti-adrenergic drugs for OCD is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Despite being fully differentiated, DNA methylation is dynamically regulated in post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons in the CA1 of the hippocampus through competing active DNA methylation and de-methylation, a process that regulates neuronal plasticity. Active DNA methylation after learning is necessary for long-term memory formation, and active DNA de-methylation by the TET enzymes has been implicated as a counter-regulator of that biochemical process. We demonstrate that Tet2 functions in the CA1 as a negative regulator of long-term memory, whereby its knockdown across the CA1 or haploinsufficiency in glutamatergic neurons enhances the fidelity of hippocampal-dependent spatial and associative memory. Loci of altered DNA methylation were then determined using whole genome bisulfite sequencing from glutamatergic Tet2 haploinsufficient CA1 tissue, which revealed hypermethylation in the promoters of genes known to be transcriptionally regulated after experiential learning. This study demonstrates a link between Tet2 activity at genes important for memory formation in CA1 glutamatergic neurons and memory fidelity.",

    "abstract": "We classify Nepenthes species into 12 functional pitcher types, based on combinations of traits that appear to comprise different syndromes for capturing nutrients, usually from animals. For nine of these types the trapping syndromes are already documented, six targeting live animals (hence carnivorous), and three targeting other nutrient sources (non-carnivorous). Yet, for three pitcher types here is no previous documentation of the syndrome and we do not yet know what sources of nutrients are being targeted. Mapping all these pitcher types on the latest, near comprehensive species-level phylogenomic tree of Nepenthes (Murphy et al. 2019) shows that apart from the ancestral pitcher type 1, most of the remaining pitcher types have evolved independently, in different parts of the phylogenetic tree, usually in several different places. Each of the 12 pitcher types is characterised morphologically and illustrated, its trapping syndrome discussed, and example species are given. An identification key to the 12 pitcher types is presented. The possibility of additional pitcher types being present is discussed.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/852137v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bbfa57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13084e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@658770org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19eca44_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOType 1 (Fig. 1).C_FLOATNO Ancestral (N. mirabilis) These species have upper pitchers which are more-or-less ovoid-cylindric in shape. The basal, ovoid part, often but not always a little wider than the upper part, is usually separated from the upper, usually cylindrical part by a \"hip\" or raised ridge that girdles the circumference of the pitcher on the exterior (also present in the six species of pitcher types 7, 8 and 10). Examination of the inner surface shows that the \"hip\" divides the glossy, broad, basal, fluid-containing, digestive, part (referred to as the \"detentive\" zone by Macfarlane (1908) because prey are detained here) from the upper opaque, dull, off-white to slightly purple, waxy or \"pruinose\" zone. This waxy zone is referred to as the \"conductive\" zone by Macfarlane because it helps conducts the insects downwards to the detentive zone with the digestive fluid. Such type 1 pitchers are shown in Fig. 1, exemplified by the upper pitchers of Nepenthes mirabilis (Lour.) Druce. The waxy zone is so-called because its surface is made up of numerous minute platelets of wax, each platelet like a roof-tile and held on a fragile stalk from the underlying surface. Juniper et al. (1989) documented how the waxy zone functions to prevent animals, usually insects, from leaving the pitchers once they have fallen in. Pressure from a foot placed on a wax \"tile\" will result in the stalk breaking, so that the insect loses its foothold and may fall back into the pitcher.\n\nC_FIG O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/852137v1_fig12.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 12\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f13b4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6bc534org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1600959org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ee42_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOPitcher type 12.

Regiae, Lee 2002) both have all the features of type 3 pitchers: widely funnel-shaped to cup-shaped, non-waxy upper parts of pitchers draining into a more slender cylindrical lower part with viscous liquid. Both species however differ from all type 3 species in their very large, flat, dark red peristomes which can be up to 3.5 cm wide in N. jacquelineae. These peristomes have been speculated to act as a landing platform for large flying insects such as blattid cockroaches and moths, which might act with the contrasting lighter, green pitcher body as a light trap for such prey. It is also possible that such prey are lured into a precarious place above the mouth by the copious nectar produced from the lower surface of the lid from large nectar glands 1.5 mm diam. (Clarke 2001). The morphological convergence between the pitchers of these two species is remarkable. Further investigation of the prey trapped in the wild would be desirable for both species. Nepenthes echinostoma Hook.f. is a species closely related to N. mirabilis but with a remarkably flat and extended peristome which resembles type 3, although it has a different pitcher shape and inner surface\n\nC_FIG",

Despite their great promise as next-generation pharmaceutical drugs, the development of new PROTACs is challenged by the complexity of the system, which involves binary and ternary interactions between components. Here, we demonstrate the strength of native mass spectrometry (nMS), a label-free technique, to provide novel insight into PROTAC-mediated protein interactions. We show that nMS can monitor the formation of ternary E3-PROTAC-POI complexes and detect various intermediate species in a single experiment. A unique benefit of the method is its ability to reveal preferentially formed E3-PROTAC-POI combinations in competition experiments with multiple substrate proteins, thereby positioning it as an ideal high-throughput screening strategy during the development of new PROTACs.",

    "abstract": "Herbivores use a wide range of factors to choose their host, including their own physiological states, physical characteristics of plants, and the degree of competition. Field observations of herbivores in their native habitats provide a means for simultaneously estimating the relative importance of these factors, but statistical analysis of all these factors may be challenging. Here we used a 7-wk dataset of leaf-cutting ant (Atta cephalotes) foraging in a diverse neotropical arboretum containing 193 tree species (822 trees) to examine the relative role of tree phylogeny, territoriality and tree functional characteristics using a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) model. We observed that 54 tree species (117 trees) were foraged by the ants. This pattern was not random, but reflected known features of leaf-cutting ant foraging behaviour, such as the preference for larger trees and the decreased likelihood of foraging at the periphery of a colonys territory. However, random effects such as tree phylogeny, the identity of individual trees and colony-specific effects, explained most of the variation in foraging data. A significant phylogenetic effect on foraging likelihood ({lambda} = 0.28), together with repeated measures of foraging on the same tree species, allowed estimation of relative palatability for each plant species. PGLS models can be flexibly scaled to include other covariates for even more complex investigation of foraging behaviour, and the link function can be modified to include the amount of plants foraged. As a result, PGLS can be used as a flexible framework for the study of LCA foraging.",

In this study, we investigate the genetic variation associated with blocking and use these analyses to generate testable hypotheses surrounding the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated dengue blocking. From our results, we hypothesise that Wolbachia may block virus replication by increasing the regeneration rate of mosquito cells via the Notch signalling pathway.

These microbes are also exposed to an atypical source of carbon: dietary fiber compacted in fecal matter. To investigate how the addition of insoluble fiber to isolation media could affect the cultivation of microbes from zebrafish intestines, an isolate library was built and analyzed using the bioinformatics pipeline IDBac. The addition of fiber led to an increase in bacterial growth and encouraged the growth of species from several phyla. Furthermore, fiber addition altered the metabolism of the cultivated gut-derived microbes and induced the production of unique metabolites that were not produced when microbes were otherwise grown on standard isolation media. Addition of this inexpensive carbon source to media supported the cultivation of a diverse community whose specialized metabolite production may more closely replicate their metabolite production in vivo.",

We assessed the clinical impact of three powerful molecular diagnostic methods.\n\nMethodsWith blood samples from 200 consecutive patients with suspected sepsis, we evaluated 1) metagenomic shotgun sequencing together with a Bayesian inference approach for contaminant sequence removal, for detecting bacterial DNA; 2) viral capture sequencing; and 3) transcript-based host response profiling for classifying patients as infected or not, and if infected, with bacteria or viruses. We then evaluated changes in diagnostic decision-making among three expert physicians by unblinding the results of these methods in a staged fashion.\n\nResultsMetagenomic shotgun sequencing confirmed positive blood culture results in 14 of 26 patients. In 17 of 200 patients, metagenomic sequencing and viral capture sequencing revealed organisms that were 1) not detected by conventional hospital tests within 5 days after presentation, and 2) classified as of probable clinical relevance by physician consensus. Host response profiling led at least two of three physicians to change their diagnostic decisions in 46 of 100 patients. The data suggested possible bacterial DNA translocation in 8 patients who were originally classified by physicians as noninfected and illustrate how host response profiling can guide interpretation of metagenomic shotgun sequencing results.\n\nConclusionsThe integration of host response profiling, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and viral capture sequencing enhances the utility of each, and may improve the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected sepsis.",

    "abstract": "The Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway is essential for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The pathway is activated when a replication fork stalls because of an ICL or other replication stress. A central event in pathway activation is the mono-ubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex by the FA Core complex, a ubiquitin ligase of nine subunits. Here we describe the cryo-EM structures of the 1.1 MDa FA Core at 3.1 angstroms, except for the FANCA subunit at 3.4, and of the complex containing Core, ID and the UBE2T ubiquitin conjugating enzyme at 4.2 angstroms. The Core has unusual stoichiometry with two copies of FANCB, FAAP100, FANCA, FAAP20, FANCG, FANCL, but only a single copy of FANCC, FANCE and FANCF. This is due to homodimers of FANCA and FANCB having incompatible 2-fold symmetry, resulting in an overall asymmetric assembly of the other subunits. The asymmetry is crucial, as it prevents the binding of a second FANC-C-E-F sub-complex that inhibits UBE2T recruitment by FANCL, and instead creates an ID binding site. The single active FANCL-UBE2T binds next to the FANCD2 ubiquitination site, prying open the FANCI-FANCD2 interface within which the ubiquitination sites are buried. These structures and biochemical data indicate a single active site ubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI sequentially, shedding light on a central event in the FA pathway.",

These atlases, represented in volumetric or surface coordinate spaces, can describe brain topology from a variety of perspectives. Although many human brain atlases have circulated the field over the past fifty years, limited effort has been devoted to their standardization. Standardization can facilitate consistency and transparency with respect to orientation, resolution, labeling scheme, file storage format, and coordinate space designation. Our group has worked to consolidate an extensive selection of popular human brain atlases into a single, curated, open-source library, where they are stored following a standardized protocol with accompanying metadata, which can serve as the basis for future atlases.

    "abstract": "The characteristics of acquiring new sequence information under dual-task situations have been extensively studied so far. Such a concurrent task has often been found to affect performance. In real life, however, we mostly perform a secondary task when the primary one is already well-acquired. The effect of a secondary task on the ability to retrieve well-established sequence representations remains elusive. The present study investigates whether accessing a well-acquired probabilistic sequence knowledge is affected by a concurrent task. Participants acquired non-adjacent regularities in a perceptual-motor implicit probabilistic sequence learning task. After a 24-hour offline period, participants were tested on the same sequence learning task under dual-task or single-task conditions. Here we show that although the secondary task significantly prolonged the overall reaction times in the primary task, the access to the previously learned probabilistic representations remained intact. Our results highlight the importance of studying the dual-task effect not only in the learning phase but also during memory access.",

    "abstract": "The late Miocene is marked by pronounced environmental changes and the appearance of strong temperature and precipitation seasonality. Although environmental heterogeneity is to be expected during this time, it is challenging to reconstruct palaeoenvironments using plant fossils. We investigated leaves and dispersed spores/pollen from 6.4-6 Ma strata in the intermontane Florina-Ptolemais-Servia Basin (FPS) of northwestern Greece. To assess how well plant fossils reflect the actual vegetation of the FPS, we assigned fossil-taxa to biomes providing a measure for environmental heterogeneity. Additionally, the palynological assemblage was compared to pollen spectra from modern lake sediments to assess biases in spore/pollen representation in the pollen record. We found a close match of the Vegora assemblage with modern Fagus-Abies forests of Turkey. Using taxonomic affinities of leaf fossils, we further established close similarities of the Vegora assemblage with modern laurophyllous oak forests of Afghanistan. Finally, using information from sedimentary environment and taphonomy, we distinguished local and distantly growing vegetation types. We then subjected the plant assemblage of Vegora to different methods of climate reconstruction and discussed their potentials and limitations. Leaf and spore/pollen records allow accurate reconstructions of palaeoenvironments in the FPS, whereas extra-regional vegetation from coastal lowlands is likely not captured.",

The liver is an essential detoxification organ that reflects systemic physiological responses to environmental changes. Here, we tested whether land use changes influence the amount of substances from the hepatic cellular catabolism and melanomacrophages of five anuran species in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used routine histological and histochemical techniques. We then use recently developed ecological methods to relate functional traits to environmental variables. There was an increase in the amount of melanin in environments with high proportion of agriculture, as well as variation in the amount of lipofuscin and hemosiderin. Therefore, the area of melanomacrophages in the liver and the metabolic products in their cytoplasm can be used as biomarkers of environmental changes in regions with intense agricultural activities. Our results add a new perspective to the influence of land use changes on environmental health by highlighting the effect of environmental changes on internal morphological aspects of animals.View Full Text",

Approaches for quick and sensitive profiling of the viral avidity towards a specific type of host-cell glycan can contribute to the understanding of tropism switching among different strains of IAV. In this study, we developed a method based on chemoenzymatic glycan engineering to investigate the possible involvement of 1-2-fucosides in IAV infections. Using a truncated human fucosyltransferase 1 (hFuT1), we were able to create 1-2-linked fucosides in situ on the host cell surface to assess their influence on the host cell binding to IAV hemagglutinin and the susceptibility of host cells toward IAV induced killing. We discovered that the newly added 1-2-fucosides on host cells enhanced the infection of several human pandemic IVA subtypes. These findings suggest that glycan epitopes other than sialic aicds should be taken into consideration for assessing the human pandemic risk of this viral pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione and its related enzymes play an integral role in cellular detoxification processes and redox buffering. A genome wide transcriptome profiling was conducted through RNA sequencing to investigate the dynamics of glutathione and related enzymes in sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench in response to Macrophomina phaseolina (MP) infection. Compared to mock inoculated control treatment, MP significantly upregulated the glutathione synthetase, glutamate cysteine ligase (involved in glutathione biosynthesis), glutathione s-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione reductase (GR) genes in a charcoal rot susceptible sorghum genotype (Tx7000), but not in a resistant genotype (SC599) at 7 days post- inoculation. The net log2 fold up-regulation of the aforesaid genes in MP-inoculated Tx7000 was 1.9, 0.9, 120.0, 9.0, and 4.5, respectively. To confirm the gene expression data, cell extracts were acquired from MP- and mock-inoculated resistant (SC599, SC35) and susceptible (Tx7000, BTx3042) sorghum genotypes and their reduced (GSH), oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, GST, GPX, and GR activities were measured using standard protocols. A significantly reduced GSH/GSSG ratio was observed in Tx7000 and BTx3042 indicating the strong oxidative stress experienced by charcoal rot susceptible genotypes under MP infection. MP significantly increased the GST, GPX, and GR activities of Tx7000 and BTx3042. Although augmented GR activity contributes to cellular GSH restoration, the enhanced GST activity leads to diminishing GSH pools through vacuolar sequestration of GSH-S-conjugates. This eases the oxidative stress confronted by susceptible genotypes under MP infection and in turn contributes to reduced charcoal rot susceptibility. The importance of GSH in controlling the MP infection associated oxidative stress was further supported by the significantly reduced disease severity observed in Tx7000 and BTx3042 upon exogenous GSH application.",

This volume complicates many genomic analyses such as taxon assignment because the associated computational burden is substantial. However, the number of representatives of each species is highly skewed towards human pathogens and model organisms. Thus many genomes contain little additional information and could be removed. We created a frugal dereplication method that can reduce massive genome collections based on genome sequence alone, without the need for manual curation nor taxonomic information.\n\nWe recently created a genome representation for bacteria and archaea called \"nanotext\". This method embeds each genome in a low-dimensional vector of numbers. Extending nanotext, our proposed algorithm called \"thinspace\" uses these vectors to group and dereplicate similar genomes.\n\nWe dereplicated the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) from about 150 thousand genomes to less than 22 thousand. The resulting collection increases the percent of classified reads in a metagenomic dataset by a factor of 5 compared to NCBI RefSeq and performs equal to both a larger as well as a manually curated GTDB subset.\n\nWith thinspace, massive genome collections can be dereplicated on regular hardware, without affecting downstream results.

We show the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single modality profiling. Furthermore, we illustrate the pre-processing steps in CiteFuse and in particular a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data.

    "abstract": "Cancer is a highly complex disease caused by multiple genetic factors. MicroRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression profiles are useful for identifying prognostic biomarkers for cancer. Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), which accounts for more than 70% of all renal malignant tumour cases, was selected for our analysis.Traditional methods of identifying cancer prognostic markers may not be accurate. Tensor decomposition (TD) is a useful method uncovering the underlying low-dimensional structures in the tensor. The TD-based unsupervised feature extraction method was applied to analyse mRNA and miRNA expression profiles. Biological annotations of the prognostic miRNAs and mRNAs were examined utilizing the pathway and oncogenic signature databases DIANA-miRPath and MSigDB.TD identified the miRNA signatures and the associated genes. These genes were found to be involved in cancer-related pathways, and 23 genes were significantly correlated with the survival of KIRC patients. We demonstrated that the results are robust and not highly dependent upon the databases we selected. Compared with traditional supervised methods tested, TD achieves much better performance in selecting prognostic miRNAs and mRNAs.These results suggest that integrated analysis using the TD-based unsupervised feature extraction technique is an effective strategy for identifying prognostic signatures in cancer studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "KRAS mutant p53 deficient (KP) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) lacks targeted therapies. Existing treatments for lung cancer cause resistance and result in toxicities requiring novel effective therapies. By targeting mechanisms causing resistance such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), KP tumors could be inhibited. MDSCs are functionally diverse and suppress T cells in many cancers. RIPK3, a cell death inducing enzyme, also functions as a signaling component producing cytokines that mediate the suppressive function of MDSCs. Partial deletion of RIPK3 in myeloid cells reduced KP tumor growth. This also reduced accumulation of MDSCs with a consistent increase in antigen specific IFN{gamma} producing CD8 T cells. Inhibiting RIPK3 with a small molecule inhibitor such as GSK 872 effectively reduces RIPK3 activity in myeloid cells including MDSCs and reduces growth of small and large KP tumors. GSK 872 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 further decreased KP tumor size. Together, our findings show that inhibiting RIPK3 in MDSCs is effective in inhibiting KP NSCLC and is a viable therapeutic option for improving existing immunotherapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Grapevine breeding becomes highly relevant due to upcoming challenges like climate change, a decrease in the number of available fungicides, increasing public concern about plant protection, and the demand for a sustainable production. Downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola is one of the most devastating diseases worldwide of cultivated Vitis vinifera. Therefore, in modern breeding programs genetic marker technologies and genomic data are used to develop new cultivars with defined and stacked resistance loci. Potential sources of resistance are wild species of American or Asian origin. The interspecific hybrid of Vitis riparia Gm 183 x V. cinerea Arnold, available as the rootstock cultivar  Borner, carries several relevant resistance loci. We applied next generation sequencing to enable the reliable identification of simple sequence repeats (SSR) and also generated a draft genome sequence assembly of  Borner to access genome wide sequence variations in a comprehensive and highly reliable way. These data were used to cover the  Borner genome with genetic marker positions. A subset of these marker positions was used for targeted mapping of the P. viticola resistance locus, Rpv14, to validate the marker position list. Based on the reference genome sequence PN40024, the position of this resistance locus can be narrowed down to less than 0.5 Mbp on chromosome 5.",

    "abstract": "The molecular architecture and function of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope is dictated by protein composition and localization. Proteins that localize to the inner (IM) and outer (OM) membranes of Gram-negative bacteria play critical and distinct roles in cellular physiology, however, approaches to systematically interrogate their distribution across both membranes and the soluble cell fraction are lacking. We employed multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry to assess membrane protein localization in a proteome-wide fashion by separating IM and OM vesicles from exponentially growing E. coli K-12 cells on a sucrose density gradient. The migration patterns for >1600 proteins were classified in an unbiased manner, accurately recapitulating decades of knowledge in membrane protein localization in E. coli. For 559 proteins that are currently annotated as peripherally associated to the IM (Orfanoudaki and Economou, 2014) and display potential for dual localization to either the IM or cytoplasm, we could allocate 110 to the IM and 206 as soluble based on their fractionation patterns. In addition, we uncovered 63 cases, in which our data disagreed with current localization annotation in protein databases. For 42 of them, we were able to find supportive evidence for our localization findings in literature. We anticipate our systems-level analysis of the E. coli membrane proteome will serve as a useful reference dataset to query membrane protein localization, as well as provide a novel methodology to rapidly and systematically map membrane protein localization in more poorly characterized Gram-negative species.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic heart diseases are classified among the leading cause of death and reduced life quality worldwide. Although revascularization strategies significantly reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI), a significant number of MI patients develop chronic heart failure over time. We have recently reported that a fragment of the extra cellular matrix (ECM) protein Agrin promotes cardiac regeneration following MI in adult mice. Here, we tested the therapeutic potential of Agrin in a preclinical porcine model, comprising either 3 or 28 days (d) reperfusion period. We first demonstrate that local (antegrade) delivery of recombinant human Agrin (rhAgrin) to the infarcted pig heart can target the affected regions in an efficient and clinically-relevant manner. Single dose of rhAgrin resulted in significant improvement in heart function, infarct size, fibrosis and adverse remodeling parameters 28 days post MI. Short-term MI experiment along with complementary murine MI studies revealed myocardial protection, improved angiogenesis, inflammatory suppression and cell cycle re-entry, as Agrins mechanisms of action. We conclude that a single dose of Agrin is capable of reducing ischemia reperfusion injury and improving cardiac function, demonstrating that Agrin could serve as a therapy for patients with acute MI and potentially heart failure.",

Priority of care is to increase the childs length of functional intestine, jejunum in particular, to improve nutritional independence. Here we report a robust protocol for reconstruction of autologous intestinal mucosal grafts using primary IF patient materials. Human jejunal intestinal organoids derived from paediatric IF patients can be expanded efficiently in vitro with region-specific markers preserved after long-term culture. Decellularized human intestinal matrix with intact ultrastructure is used as biological scaffolds. Proteomic and Raman spectroscopic analyses reveal highly analogous biochemical composition of decellularized human SI and colon matrix, implying that they can both be utilised as scaffolds for jejunal graft reconstruction. Indeed, seeding of primary human jejunal organoids to either SI or colonic scaffolds in vitro can efficiently reconstruct functional jejunal grafts with persistent disaccharidase activity as early as 4 days after seeding, which can further survive and mature after transplantation in vivo. Our findings pave the way towards regenerative medicine for IF patients.",

Common mass spectrometry-based metabolomics workflows first identify the small molecules significantly associated with the outcome of interest, then begin exploring their biochemical relationships to understand biological fate (environmental studies) or biological impact (physiological response). We suggest an alternative by which biochemical relationships can be directly retrieved through untargeted high-resolution paired mass distance (PMD) analysis without a priori knowledge of the identities of participating compounds. Retrieval is done using high resolution mass spectrometry as a chemical reaction detector, where PMDs calculated from the mass spectrometry data are linked to biochemical reactions obtained via data mining of small molecule and reaction databases, i.e.  Reactomics. We demonstrate applications of reactomics including PMD network analysis, source appointment of unknown compounds, and biomarker reaction discovery as a complement to compound discovery analyses used in traditional untargeted workflows.

    "abstract": "Alterations in the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway result in the constitutive activation of NRF2, leading to the aberrant induction of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes, including NQO1. The NQO1 bioactivatable agent {beta}-lapachone can target cells with high NQO1 expression but relies in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are actively scavenged in cells with NRF2/KEAP1 mutations. However, whether NRF2/KEAP1 mutations influence the response to {beta}-lapachone treatment remains unknown. To address this question, we assessed the cytotoxicity of {beta}-lapachone in a panel of NSCLC cell lines bearing either wild-type or mutant KEAP1. We found that, despite overexpression of NQO1, KEAP1 mutant cells were resistant to {beta}-lapachone due to enhanced detoxification of ROS, which prevented DNA damage and cell death. To evaluate whether specific inhibition of the NRF2-regulated antioxidant enzymes could abrogate resistance to {beta}-lapachone, we systematically inhibited the four major antioxidant cellular systems using genetic and/or pharmacologic approaches. We demonstrated that inhibition of the thioredoxin-dependent system or copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) could abrogate NRF2-mediated resistance to {beta}-lapachone, while depletion of catalase or glutathione was ineffective. Interestingly, inhibition of SOD1 selectively sensitized KEAP1 mutant cells to {beta}-lapachone exposure. Our results suggest that NRF2/KEAP1 mutational status might serve as a predictive biomarker for response to NQO1-bioactivatable quinones in patients. Further, our results suggest SOD1 inhibition may have potential utility in combination with other ROS inducers in patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAberrant activation of NRF2 in non-small cell lung cancer promotes resistance to {beta}-lapachone via the antioxidant defense.\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of the thioredoxin-dependent system and superoxide dismutase 1 increase sensitivity to {beta}-lapachone treatment.\nC_LIO_LIMutations in the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway might serve as predictive biomarker for response to {beta}-lapachone in patients.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Identifying genes underlying genetic associations of complex disease is challenging because most common risk variants reside in non-protein coding regions of the genome and likely alter the expression of target genes by disrupting tissue and cell-type specific regulatory elements. To address this challenge, we developed a methodological framework, eQTL-MAGMA (eMAGMA), that converts SNP-level summary statistics into gene-level association statistics by assigning non-coding SNPs to their putative genes based on tissue-specific eQTL information. We compared eMAGMA to three eQTL informed gene-based approaches--S-PrediXcan, FUSION, and SMR--using simulated phenotype data. Phenotypes were simulated based on eQTL reference data using GCTA for all genes with at least one eQTL at chromosome 1 (651 genes). We performed 10 simulations per gene. The eQTL-h2 (i.e., the proportion of variation explained by the eQTLs was set at 1%, 2%, and 5%. We found eMAGMA outperforms other gene-based approaches across a range of simulated parameters (e.g. the number of identified causal genes). When applied to genome-wide association summary statistics for major depression, eMAGMA identified substantially more putative candidate causal genes compared to other eQTL-based approaches. By integrating tissue-specific eQTL information, these results show eMAGMA will help to identify novel candidate causal genes from genome-wide association summary statistics and thereby improve the understanding of the biological basis of complex disorders.",

    "abstract": "Introgression from wild relatives is a valuable source of novel allelic diversity for breeding. We investigated the genomic patterns of introgression from Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. The population of 351 BC1F3:5 lines was selected based on phenology from crosses between six hexaploid wheat lines and 21 wheat-Ae. tauschii octoploids. SNP markers developed for this population and a diverse panel of 116 Ae. tauschii accessions by complexity-reduced genome sequencing were used to detect introgression based on the identity-by-descent analysis. Overall, introgression frequency positively correlated with recombination rate, with a high incidence of introgression at the ends of chromosomes and low in the pericentromeric regions, and was negatively related to sequence divergence between the parental genomes. Reduced introgression in the pericentromeric low-recombining regions spans nearly 2/3 of each chromosome arm, suggestive of the polygenic nature of introgression barriers that could be associated with multilocus negative epistasis between the alleles of wild and cultivated wheat. On the contrary, negative selection against the wild allele of Tg, controlling free-threshing trait and located in the high-recombining chromosomal region, led to reduced introgression only within [~]10 Mbp region around Tg. These results are consistent with the effect of selection on linked variation described by the Hill-Robertson effect, and offer insights into the introgression population development for crop imrpovement to ensure retention of introgressed diversity across entire genome.",

Among the different versions of CLIP developed, the incorporation of photoactivable nucleoside analogs into cellular RNA has proven to be especially valuable, allowing for high efficiency photoactivable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP). Although PAR-CLIP has become an established technique for use in eukaryotes, it has not yet been applied in prokaryotes. To determine if PAR-CLIP can be used in prokaryotes, we first investigated whether 4-thiouridine (4SU), a photoactivable nucleoside, can be incorporated into E. coli RNA. After determining 4SU incorporation into RNA, we developed suitable conditions for crosslinking of proteins in E. coli cells and for the isolation of crosslinked RNA. Applying this technique to Hfq, a well-characterized regulator of small RNA (sRNA) - messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions, we showed that PAR-CLIP identified most of the known sRNA targets of Hfq.

Until recently it was the largest self-sustaining fishery of the native oyster in Europe. We developed a new larval settlement behavioural model that is the simplest plausible model which remains consistent with all available data and evidence on larval behaviour. We used a hydrodynamic sub-model, a Lagrangian advection sub-model, and an individual agent based model. The results demonstrate how isolated oyster assemblages can re-populate larger areas of historical inhabitance. We predict the most likely patterns of redistribution from refugia or from fisheries seeding. We show that settlement swimming behaviour is as equally important as passive hydrodynamic transport for larval survival and adult distribution and that settlement swimming behaviour has a profound impact on settlement patterns. The models show that managed broodstock refugia have the potential to seed much larger oyster beds in contrast to broad-scale seeding. Such refugia have the advantage of maintaining a locally high and mature population with potential for reef features and their associated biodiversity. We show that such refugia may be best placed in the tidally dynamic and exposed areas rather than on sheltered coastal sites as they have been in the past. Our model is insensitive to parameter variation and could be an effective and practical management tool in the face of a paucity of field data on larval distribution and behaviour.",

Here, we show that alveolar stem cell differentiation during lung regeneration involves a unique previously uncharacterized transitional state that exhibits cardinal features normally associated with cell senescence. Specifically, using organoid cultures, multiple in vivo injury models coupled with single cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing analysis, we find that alveolar stem cell differentiation involves a novel, pre-alveolar type-1 transitional state (PATS) en route to their terminal maturation. PATS can be distinguished based on their unique transcriptional signatures, including enrichment for TP53, TGF{beta}, and DNA damage repair signaling, and cellular senescence in both in vivo and ex vivo regenerating tissues. Significantly, PATS undergo extensive cell stretching, which makes them vulnerable to DNA damage, a feature commonly associated with most degenerative lung diseases. Importantly, we find enrichment of PATS-like state in human fibrotic lung tissues, suggesting that persistence of such transitional states underlies the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Our study thus redefines senescence as a state that can occur as part of a normal tissue maintenance program, and can be derailed in human disease, notably fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Lateral inhibition patterns differentiated cells during development in bacteria, metazoans and land plants. Tip-growing rhizoid cells develop among flat epidermal cells in the epidermis of the early diverging land plant Marchantia polymorpha. We show that the majority of rhizoid cells develop individually but some develop in linear, one-dimensional clusters of between two and seven rhizoid cells in wild type plants. The distribution of rhizoid cells can be accounted for within a simple model of lateral inhibition. The model also predicted that, in the absence of lateral inhibition, rhizoid cell clusters would be two-dimensional with larger clusters than those formed with lateral inhibition. Rhizoid differentiation in Marchantia polymorpha is positively regulated by the ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE1 (MpRSL1) basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH) transcription factor which is directly repressed by the FEW RHIZOIDS1 (MpFRH1) miRNA. To test if MpFRH1 miRNA acts during lateral inhibition we generated loss-of-function mutants that did not produce the MpFRH1 miRNA. Two-dimensional clusters of rhizoids develop in Mpfrh1loss-of-function (lof) mutants as predicted by the model for plants that lack lateral inhibition. Furthermore, clusters of up to nine rhizoid cells developed in the Mpfrh1lof mutants compared to a maximum number of seven observed in wild type. The higher steady state levels of MpRSL1 mRNA in Mpfrh1lof mutants indicate that MpFRH1-mediated lateral inhibition involves the repression of MpRSL1 activity. Together the modelling and genetic data indicate that the pattern of cell differentiation in the M. polymorpha epidermis is consistent with a lateral inhibition process in which MpFRH1 miRNA represses MpRSL1. This discovery suggests that novel mechanisms of lateral inhibition may operate in different lineages of land plants, unlike metazoans where the conserved Delta-Notch signaling system controls lateral inhibition in diverse metazoan lineages.",

In host-parasite interactions, host phenology can affect parasite fitness due to the temporal constraints it imposes on host contact rates. However, it remains unclear how parasite transmission is shaped by the wide range of phenological patterns observed in nature. We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi. Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBirth-death processes have given biologists a model-based framework to answer questions about changes in the birth and death rates of lineages in a phylogenetic tree. Therefore birth-death models are central to macroevolutionary as well as phylodynamic analyses. Early approaches to studying temporal variation in birth and death rates using birth-death models faced difficulties due to the restrictive choices of birth and death rate curves through time. Sufficiently flexible time-varying birth-death models are still lacking. We use a piecewise-constant birth-death model, combined with both Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and horseshoe Markov random field (HSMRF) prior distributions, to approximate arbitrary changes in birth rate through time. We implement these models in the widely used statistical phylogenetic software platform RevBayes, allowing us to jointly estimate birth-death process parameters, phylogeny, and nuisance parameters in a Bayesian framework. We test both GMRF-based and HSMRF-based models on a variety of simulated diversification scenarios, and then apply them to both a macroevolutionary and an epidemiological dataset. We find that both models are capable of inferring variable birth rates and correctly rejecting variable models in favor of effectively constant models. In general the HSMRF-based model has higher precision than its GMRF counterpart, with little to no loss of accuracy. Applied to a macroevolutionary dataset of the Australian gecko family Pygopodidae (where birth rates are interpretable as speciation rates), the GMRF-based model detects a slow decrease whereas the HSMRF-based model detects a rapid speciation-rate decrease in the last 12 million years. Applied to an infectious disease phylodynamic dataset of sequences from HIV subtype A in Russia and Ukraine (where birth rates are interpretable as the rate of accumulation of new infections), our models detect a strongly elevated rate of infection in the 1990s.\n\nAO_SCPLOWUTHORC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWSUMMARYC_SCPLOWBoth the growth of groups of species and the spread of infectious diseases through populations can be modeled as birth-death processes. Birth events correspond either to speciation or infection, and death events to extinction or becoming noninfectious. The rates of birth and death may vary over time, and by examining this variation researchers can pinpoint important events in the history of life on Earth or in the course of an outbreak. Time-calibrated phylogenies track the relationships between a set of species (or infections) and the times of all speciation (or infection) events, and can thus be used to infer birth and death rates. We develop two phylogenetic birth-death models with the goal of discerning signal of rate variation from noise due to the stochastic nature of birth-death models. Using a variety of simulated datasets, we show that one of these models can accurately infer slow and rapid rate shifts without sacrificing precision. Using real data, we demonstrate that our new methodology can be used for simultaneous inference of phylogeny and rates through time.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are routinely analyzed using methods that measure activity in canonical frequency bands (e.g. alpha, 8-12 Hz), though the frequency of neural signals is not fixed and varies within and across individuals based on numerous factors including neuroanatomy, behavioral demands, and species. Further, band-limited activity is an often assumed, typically unmeasured model of neural activity and band definitions vary considerably across studies. These factors together mask individual differences and can lead to noisy spectral estimates and interpretational problems when linking electrophysiology to behavior. We developed the Oscillatory ReConstruction Algorithm (\"ORCA\"), an unsupervised method to measure the spectral characteristics of neural signals in adaptively identified bands which incorporates two new methods for frequency band identification. ORCA uses the instantaneous power, phase, and frequency of activity in each band to reconstruct the signal and directly quantify spectral decomposition performance using each of four different models. To reduce researcher bias, ORCA provides spectral estimates derived from the best model and requires minimal hyperparameterization. Analyzing human scalp EEG data during eyes open and eyes-closed \"resting\" conditions, we first identify variability in the frequency content of neural signals across subjects and electrodes. We demonstrate that ORCA significantly improves spectral decomposition compared to conventional methods and captures the well-known increase in low-frequency activity during eyes closure in electrode- and subject-specific frequency bands. We further illustrate the utility of our method in rodent CA1 recordings. ORCA is a novel analytic tool that will allow researchers to investigate how non-stationary neural oscillations vary across behaviors, brain regions, individuals, and species.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion control in mammals has been hypothesized to be governed by a central pattern generator (CPG) located in the circuitry of the spinal cord. The most common model of the CPG is the half center model, where two pools of neurons generate alternating, oscillatory activity. In this model, the pools reciprocally inhibit each other ensuring alternating activity. There is experimental support for reciprocal inhibition. However another crucial part of the half center model is a self inhibitory mechanism which prevents the neurons of each individual pool from infinite firing. Self-inhibition is hence necessary to obtain alternating activity. But critical parts of the experimental bases for the proposed mechanisms for self-inhibition were obtained in vitro, in preparations of juvenile animals. The commonly used adaptation of spike firing does not appear to be present in adult animals in vivo. We therefore modeled several possible self inhibitory mechanisms for locomotor control. Based on currently published data, previously proposed hypotheses of the self inhibitory mechanism, necessary to support the CPG hypothesis, seems to be put into question by functional evaluation tests or by in vivo data. This opens for alternative explanations of how locomotion activity patterns in the adult mammal could be generated.\n\nAuthor summaryLocomotion control in animals is hypothesized to be controlled through an intrinsic central pattern generator in the spinal cord. This was proposed over a hundred years ago and has subsequently been formed into a consistent theory, through experimentation and computer modeling. However, critical data that support the neuronal circuitry mechanisms underpinning this theory has been obtained in experiments that greatly differ from intact animals. We propose, after trying to fill in this critical part, that new ideas are required to explain locomotion of intact animals.",

    "abstract": "The protective effect of transthyretin (TTR) on cellular toxicity of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) has been previously reported. TTR is a tetrameric carrier of thyroxine in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, whose pathogenic aggregation causes systemic amyloidosis. In contrast, many reports have shown that TTR binds amyloid-beta (A{beta}), associated with Alzheimers disease, alters its aggregation, and inhibits its toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we question whether TTR amyloidogenic ability and its anti-amyloid inhibitory effect are associated. Our results indicate that the dissociation of the TTR tetramer, required for its amyloid pathogenesis, is also necessary to prevent cellular toxicity from A{beta} oligomers. These findings suggest that the A{beta} binding site of TTR may be hidden in its tetrameric form. Aided by computational docking and peptide screening, we identified a TTR segment that is capable of altering A{beta} aggregation and toxicity, mimicking TTR cellular protection. This segment inhibits A{beta} oligomer formation and also promotes the formation of non-toxic, non-amyloid, amorphous aggregates which are more sensitive to protease digestion. This segment also inhibits seeding of A{beta} catalyzed by A{beta} fibrils extracted from the brain of an Alzheimers patient. Our results suggest that mimicking the inhibitory effect of TTR with peptide-based therapeutics represents an additional avenue to explore for the treatment of Alzheimers disease.\n\nSignificance statementThe pathological landmarks of Alzheimers disease are the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques contain fibrous structures made of aggregated amyloid-beta (A{beta}). In 1982, Shirahama and colleagues observed the presence of transthyretin (TTR) in these plaques. TTR is a tetrameric protein whose aggregation causes transthyretin amyloidosis. However, TTR protects A{beta} from aggregating and causing toxicity to neurons. In this study, we show that the dissociation of TTR tetramers is required to inhibit cellular toxicity caused by A{beta}. In addition, we identified a minimum segment of TTR that inhibits A{beta} aggregation and cellular toxicity by the formation of amorphous aggregates that are sensitive to proteases, similar to the natural effect of TTR found by others in vivo.",

Recent studies revealed structural diversity of endogenous mRNA caps, which carry different 5-terminal nucleotides and additional methylations (2-O-methylation and m6A). Currently available 5-capping methods do not address this diversity. We report trinucleotide 5-cap analogs (m7GpppN(m)pG), which are utilized by RNA polymerase T7 to initiate transcription from templates carrying {Phi}6.5 promoter and enable production of mRNAs differing in the identity of the first transcribed nucleotide (N = A, m6A, G, C, U) and its methylation status ({+/-} 2-O-methylation). HPLC-purified mRNAs carrying these 5 caps were used to study protein expression in three mammalian cell lines (3T3-L1, HeLa, and JAWS II). In all cases the highest expression was achieved for mRNAs carrying 5-terminal A and m6A, whereas the lowest was observed for G and Gm. The 2-O-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide (cap 1) significantly increased expression compared to cap 0 only in JAWS II dendritic cells. Further experiments indicated that the mRNA expression characteristic does not correlate with affinity for translation initiation factor 4E or in vitro susceptibility to decapping, but instead depends on mRNA purity and the immune state of the cells.",

    "abstract": "The motility of microalgae has been studied extensively, particularly in model microorganisms such as Chlamy-domonas reinhardtii. For this and other microalgal species, diurnal cycles are well-known to control the metabolism, growth and cell division. Diurnal variations, however, have been largely neglected in quantitative studies of motility. Here, we demonstrate using tracking microscopy how the motility statistics of C. reinhardtii are modulated by diurnal cycles. We discovered that the mean swimming speed is greater during the dark period of a diurnal cycle. From this measurement, using a hydrodynamic power balance, we conjecture that this is a result of the mean flagellar beat frequency being modulated by the flagellar ATP. Our measurements also quantify the diurnal variations of the orientational and gravitactic transport of C. reinhardtii. We discuss the implications of our frequency results in the context of cellular bioenergetics. Further, we explore the population-level consequences of diurnal variations of motility statistics by evaluating a prediction for how the gravitactic steady state changes with time during a diurnal cycle.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe report tracking microscopy measurements which demonstrate that the mean swimming speed of C. reinhardtii is significantly greater during the dark period of a diurnal cycle. Using hydrodynamic (low Reynolds number) power balance, we also inferred the mean flagellar beat frequency from the swimming speed, hypothesising that the observed variations in this frequency correlate with the diurnal regulation of flagellar ATP. Diurnal variations of the orientational and gravitactic transport of C. reinhardtii were also quantified and used in a continuum model to predict that, at the population scale, the steady state vertical distribution of C. reinhardtii is broader during the dark period. Our findings could have significant implications for microalgal biotechnologies, e.g. microalgal harvesting, and plankton migration in the ocean.",

Here, by analyzing 35 novel Legionellales genomes mainly acquired through metagenomics, we show that this group is much more diverse than previously thought, and that key host-adaptation events took place very early in its evolution. Crucial virulence factors like the Type IVB secretion (Dot/Icm) system and two shared effector proteins were gained in the last Legionellales common ancestor (LLCA), while many metabolic gene families were lost in LLCA and its immediate descendants. We estimate that LLCA lived circa 2.4 Ga ago, predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) by at least 0.5 Ga 4. These elements strongly indicate that host-adaptation arose only once in Legionellales, and that these bacteria were using advanced molecular machinery to exploit and manipulate host cells very early in eukaryogenesis.",

We used amyloid-{beta} positive AD and negative healthy subjects, three longitudinal sMRI scans (cortical thickness and subcortical volume) over two years.

We also identified outliers (n=3, 4.2%) and observations with uncertain classification (n=3, 4.2%). The clusters differed not only in regional distributions of atrophy at baseline, but also longitudinal atrophy progression, age at AD onset, and cognitive decline. A framework for the longitudinal assessment of variability in cohorts with several neuroimaging measures was successfully developed.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradative pathway important for tumor surveillance. Autophagy deficiency can lead to tumorigenesis. Autophagy is also known to be important for the aggressive growth of tumors, yet the mechanism that sustains the growth of autophagy-deficient tumors is not known. We previously reported that progression of hepatic tumors developed in autophagy-deficient livers required high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) that is released from autophagy-deficient hepatocytes. However, the mechanism by which HMGB1 promotes hepatic tumorigenesis is not understood. In this study we examined the pathological features of the hepatic tumors and the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated tumorigenesis using liver-specific autophagy-deficient (Atg7-/-) and Atg7-/-/Hmgb1-/- mice. We found that in Atg7-/- mice the tumors cells were still deficient in autophagy and could also release HMGB1. Histological analysis using cell-specific markers suggested that fibroblast and ductular cells were present only outside the tumor whereas macrophages were present both inside and outside the tumor. Genetic deletion of HMGB1 or one of its receptors, receptor for advanced glycated end product (Rage), retarded liver tumor development. In addition, we found that expression of RAGE was only on ductual cells and Kupffers cells but not on hepatoctyes, which suggested that HMGB1 might promote hepatic tumor growth through a paracrine mode that altered the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, HMGB1 and RAGE enhanced the proliferation capability of the autophagy-deficient hepatocytes and tumors. Finally, RNAseq analysis of the tumors indicated that HMGB1 induced a much broad changes in tumors. In particular, genes related to mitochondrial structures or functions were enriched among those differentially expressed in tumors in the presence or absence of HMGB1, revealing a potential key role of mitochondria in sustaining the growth of autophagy-deficient liver tumors via HMGB1 stimulation.",

Powered by a Ca2+ binding myoneme mesh architecture, Spirostomum is able to twist its two ends in the same direction and fully contract to 75% of its body length within five milliseconds, followed by a slow elongation mechanism driven by the uncoiling of the microtubules. To elucidate the principles of this rapid contraction and slow elongation cycle, we used high-speed imaging to examine the same-direction coiling of the two ends of the cell and immunofluorescence techniques to visualize and quantify the structural changes in the myoneme mesh, microtubule arrays, and the cell membrane. Lastly, we provide support for our hypotheses using a simple physical model that captures key features of Spirostomums ultrafast twisting contraction.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEUltrafast movements are ubiquitous in nature, and some of the most fascinating ultrafast biophysical systems are found on the cellular level. Quantitative studies and models are key to understand the biophysics of these fast movements. In this work, we study Spirostomums ultrafast contraction by using high-speed imaging, labeling relevant cytoskeletal structures, and building a physical model to provide a biophysical mechanism especially of the helical same direction twisting of this extremely large single cell organism. Deeper understanding of how single cells can execute extreme shape changes hold potential for advancing basic cell biophysics and also inspire new cellular inspired actuators for engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "RationaleMean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count (PLT) are platelet measures that have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality risk. Identifying protein biomarkers for these measures may yield insights into CVD mechanisms.\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to identify causal protein biomarkers for MPV and PLT among 71 CVD-related plasma proteins measured in Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe conducted integrative analyses of genetic variants associated with PLT and MPV with protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) variants associated with plasma proteins followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) to infer causal relations of proteins for PLT/MPV, and tested protein-PLT/MPV association in FHS participants. Utilizing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived megakaryocyte (MK) clones that produce functional platelets, we conducted RNA-sequencing and analyzed transcriptome-wide differences between low- and high-platelet producing clones. We then performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene knockdown experiments targeting genes encoding proteins with putatively causal platelet effects in MK clones to examine effects on platelet production. Protein-trait association analyses were conducted for MPV (n = 4,348) and PLT (n = 4,272). Eleven proteins were associated with MPV and 31 with PLT. MR identified four putatively causal proteins for MPV and four for PLT. Glycoprotein V (GP5), granulin (GRN), and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) were associated with PLT in both protein-trait and MR analyses. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) showed significant association with MPV in both analyses. MK RNA-sequencing analysis results were directionally concordant with observed and MR-inferred associations for GP5, GRN, and MCAM. In siRNA gene knockdown experiments, silencing GP5, GRN, and MPO decreased platelet counts.\n\nConclusionsBy integrating population genomics data, epidemiological data, and iPSC-derived MK experiments, we identified four proteins that are causally linked to platelet counts. These proteins and genes may be further explored for their utility in increasing platelet production in bioreactors for transfusion medicine purposes as well as their roles in the pathogenesis of CVD via a platelet/blood coagulation-based mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The success of cancer therapies based on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant relies on the ability to separate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) from graft-versus-tumor (GVT) responses. Controlling donor T cell migration into peripheral tissues is a viable option to limit unwanted tissue damage, but a lack of specific targets limits progress on this front. Here, we show that the adaptor protein CrkL, but not the closely related family members CrkI or CrkII, is a crucial regulator of T cell migration. In vitro, CrkL-deficient T cells fail to polymerize actin in response to the integrin ligand ICAM-1, resulting in defective migration. Using a mouse model of GvHD/GVT, we found that while CrkL-deficient T cells can efficiently eliminate hematopoietic tumors they are unable to migrate into inflamed organs, such as the liver and small intestine, and thus do not cause GvHD. These results suggest a specific role for CrkL in trafficking to peripheral organs but not the lymphatic system. In line with this, we found that although CrkL-deficient T cells could clear hematopoietic tumors, they failed to clear the same tumor growing subcutaneously, highlighting the role of CrkL in controlling T cell migration into peripheral tissues. Our results define a unique role for CrkL in controlling T cell migration, and suggest that CrkL function could be therapeutically targeted to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies involving allogeneic donor cells.",

The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. Using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, ribosome profiling and mRNA stability assays we show recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site. This interaction only occurs when the ribosome lacks accommodated A-site tRNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of Not5 results in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our analysis elucidates a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome providing mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) needs to protect current content from interference and simultaneously be amenable to rapid updating with newly relevant information. An influential model suggests these opposing requirements are met via a basal ganglia (BG) - thalamus gating mechanism that allows for selective updating of prefrontal cortex (PFC) WM representations. A large neuroimaging literature supports the general involvement of the PFC, BG, and thalamus, as well as posterior parietal cortex (PPC), in WM. However, the specific functional contributions of these regions to key sub-processes of WM updating, namely gate-opening, content substitution, and gate closing, are still unknown, as common WM tasks conflate these processes. We therefore combined functional MRI with the reference-back task, specifically designed to tease apart these sub-processes. Participants compared externally presented face stimuli to a reference face held in WM, while alternating between updating and maintaining this reference, resulting in opening vs. closing the gate to WM. Gate opening and substitution processes were associated with strong BG, thalamic and fronto-parietal activation, but - intriguingly - the same activity profile was observed for sensory cortex supporting task stimulus processing (i.e., the fusiform face area). In contrast, gate closing was not reliably associated with any of these regions. These findings provide new support for the involvement of the BG in gate opening as suggested by the gating model, but qualify the models assumptions by demonstrating that gate closing does not seem to depend on the BG, and that gate opening also involves task-relevant sensory cortex.",

The spot detection algorithm uses the a trous wavelet transform, a computationally inexpensive method that is robust to imaging noise. By combining automated with manual spot curation in the user interface, fluorescent puncta can be carefully selected and measured against their local background to extract high quality single-cell data. Integrated into the workflow are segmentation and spot-inspection tools that enable almost real-time interaction with images without time consuming pre-processing steps.

The new specimens exhibit gradual enclosure of the parietal embayment that characterizes Pentaceratops, providing support for the phylogenetic hypothesis that Pentaceratops and Anchiceratops are closely related. This stepwise change of morphologic characters observed in chasmosaurine taxa that do not overlap stratigraphically is supportive of evolution by anagenesis. Recently published hypotheses that place Pentaceratops and Anchiceratops into separate clades are not supported. This phylogenetic relationship demonstrates unrestricted movement of large-bodied taxa between hitherto purported northern and southern provinces in the Late Campanian, weakening support for the hypothesis of extreme faunal provincialism in the Late Cretaceous Western Interior.View Full Text",

Canonical metaproteomic data processing pipelines typically involve matching spectra produced by the mass spectrometer to a theoretical spectra database, followed by matching the identified peptides back to parent proteins. However, the nature of enzymatic digestion produces peptides that can be found in multiple proteins due to conservation or chance, presenting difficulties with protein and functional assignment. To combat this challenge, we developed a peptide-centric metaproteomic workflow focused on the analysis of human gut microbiome samples. Our workflow includes a curated peptide database annotated with KEGG terms and a pathway enrichment analysis adapted for peptide level data. Analysis using our peptide-centric workflow is fast and identifies more enriched KEGG pathways than protein-centric analysis.

Susceptibility weighted images computed from the gradient recalled echo data revealed regional hypointensities in the hippocampus, cortex, caudate nucleus and thalamus of P301L mice, which in corresponding phase images indicated diamagnetic lesions. Concomitantly, {micro}CT detected hyperdense lesions. Occurrence of diamagnetic susceptibility lesions in the hippocampus, increased with age. Immunochemical staining of brain sections revealed bone protein-positive deposits. Furthermore, intra-neuronal and vessel-associated protein-containing nodules co-localized with phosphorylated-tau (AT8 and AT100) in the hippocampus. Protein-containing nodules were detected also in the thalamus in the absence of phosphorylated-tau deposition. In contrast, osteocalcin-containing nodules were vessel-associated, indicating ossified vessels, in the thalamus in absence of phosphorylated-tau. In summary, MRI and {micro}CT demonstrated imaging pattern of intracranial calcification, concomitant with immunohistochemical evidence of formation of protein deposits containing bone proteins along with phosphorylated-tau in the P301L mouse model of human tauopathy. The P301L mouse model may thus serve as a future model to study the pathogenesis of brain calcifications in tauopathies.",

To overcome this, we developed PRISM, a latent statistical framework to simultaneously extract the sample composition and cell type specific whole-transcriptome profiles adapted to each individual sample. Our results indicate that the PRISM-derived composition-free transcriptomic profiles and signatures derived from them predict the patient response better than the composite raw bulk data.

However, it is now apparent that MSCs comprise an inhomogeneous population of cells, and the fate of individual subpopulations during this differentiation process is not well understood. We analyzed the trajectory of MSC differentiation during chondrogenesis using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using a machine learning technique - lasso regularized logistic regression - we showed that multiple subpopulations of cells existed at all stages during MSC chondrogenesis and were better-defined by transcription factor activity rather than gene expression. Trajectory analysis indicated that subpopulations of MSCs were not intrinsically specified or restricted, but instead remained multipotent and could differentiate into three main cell types: cartilage, hypertrophic cartilage, and bone. Lasso regularized logistic regression showed several advances in scRNA-seq analysis, namely identification of a small number of highly influential genes or transcription factors for downstream validation, and cell type classification with high accuracy. Additionally, we showed that MSC differentiation trajectory may exhibit donor to donor variation, although key influential pathways were comparable between donors. Our data provide an important resource to study gene expression and to deconstruct gene regulatory networks in MSC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Human lysine demethylase KDM5A is a chromatin modifying enzyme associated with transcriptional regulation due to its ability to catalyze removal of methyl groups from methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Amplification of KDM5A is observed in a number of cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and gastric cancer. In this study, we employed alanine scanning mutagenesis to investigate substrate recognition of KDM5A and identify the H3 tail residues necessary for KDM5A-catalyzed demethylation. Our data show that the H3Q5 residue is critical for substrate recognition by KDM5A. Our data also reveal that the protein-protein interactions between KDM5A and the histone H3 tail extend beyond the amino acids proximal to the substrate mark. Specifically, demethylation activity assays show that deletion or mutation of residues at positions 14-18 on the H3 tail results in an 8-fold increase in the KMapp compared to wild-type 18mer peptide, suggesting this distal epitope is important in histone engagement. Finally, we demonstrate that post-translational modifications on this distal epitope can modulate KDM5A-dependent demethylation. Our findings provide insights into H3K4-specific recognition by KDM5A as well as how chromatin context can regulate KDM5A activity and H3K4 methylation status.",

    "abstract": "T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, playing a role in both the direct and indirect killing of pathogens and transformed cells. The activation of T cells is the result of a complex signaling cascade, initiated at the T cell receptor (TCR), and ending with the induction of proliferation. CD45, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, is one of the most abundant membrane proteins on T cells and functions by regulating activation directly downstream of the TCR. As a result of alternative splicing, CD45 can be expressed in multiple isoforms, naive T cells express the CD45RA isoform, while activated T cells gain expression of CD45RO, which has been proposed to increase signaling. Though the importance of CD45 in TCR signaling, proliferation and cytokine production is well established, little is known about the regulation of CD45 activity. We discovered that the immune-specific tetraspanin CD53 directly affects the stability and function of CD45RO in T cells.\n\nWe have identified CD53 as a T cell co-stimulatory molecule in primary human and murine cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the absence of CD53 leads to an altered CD45 isoform expression as a result of decreased CD45RO stability on the cell surface. This instability was accompanied by increased mobility as measured by FRAP.\n\nTogether, this indicates that CD53 functions as a stabilizer of CD45RO, and therefore as a positive regulator of TCR signaling at the T cell surface. Our data provides novel insight into the role of tetraspanins in the regulation of immune signaling and may provide a new avenue for the regulation of T cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "Import of yeast peroxisomal matrix proteins is initiated by cytosolic receptors, which specifically recognize and bind the respective cargo proteins. At the peroxisomal membrane, the cargo-loaded receptor interacts with the docking protein Pex14p that is tightly associated with Pex17p. Previous data suggest that this interaction triggers the formation of an import pore for further translocation of the cargo. The mechanistic principles are however unclear, mainly because structures of higher order assemblies are still lacking. Here, using an integrative approach, we provide the first structural characterization of the major components of the peroxisomal docking complex Pex14p/Pex17p, in a native bilayer environment and reveal its subunit organization. Our data show that three copies of Pex14p and a single copy of Pex17p assemble to form a 20 nm rod-like particle. The different subunits are arranged in a parallel manner, showing interactions along their complete sequences and providing receptor binding-sites on both membrane sides. The long rod facing the cytosol is mainly formed by the predicted coiled-coil domains of Pex14p and Pex17p, possibly providing the necessary structural support for the formation of the import pore. Further implications of Pex14p/Pex17p for formation of the peroxisomal translocon are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Proton Gradient Regulation 5 (PGR5) is involved in the control of photosynthetic electron transfer but its mechanistic role is not yet clear. Several models have been proposed to explain phenotypes such as a diminished steady state proton motive force (pmf) and increased photodamage of photosystem I (PSI). Playing a regulatory role in cyclic electron flow (CEF) around PSI, PGR5 contributes indirectly to PSI protection by enhancing photosynthetic control, which is a pH-dependent downregulation of electron transfer at the cytochrome b6f complex (b6f). Here, we re-evaluated the role of PGR5 in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and conclude that pgr5 possesses a dysfunctional b6f. Our data indicate that the b6f low-potential chain redox activity likely operated in two distinct modes - via the canonical Q cycle during linear electron flow and via an alternative Q cycle during CEF, attributing a ferredoxin-plastoquinone reductase activity to the b6f. The latter mode allowed efficient oxidation of the low-potential chain in the WT b6f. A switch between the two Q cycle modes was dependent of PGR5 and relied on unknown stromal electron carrier(s), which were a general requirement for b6f activity. In CEF-favouring conditions the electron transfer bottleneck in pgr5 was the b6f and insufficient flexibility in the low-potential chain redox tuning might account for the mutant pmf phenotype and the secondary consequences. Models of our findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol is a hallmark of Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease caused by mutations primarily in the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1. NPC1 contains a transmembrane sterol sensing domain (SSD), which is supposed to regulate protein activity upon cholesterol binding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that the binding of cholesterol to the SSD of NPC1 suppresses conformational dynamics of the luminal domains which otherwise bring the luminal N-terminal domain (NTD) closer to the lipid bilayer. The presence of an additional 20% membrane cholesterol has negligible impact on this process. We propose that cholesterol acts as an allosteric effector, and the modulation of NTD dynamics by the SSD-bound cholesterol constitutes an allosteric feedback mechanism in NPC1 which controls cholesterol abundance in the lysosomal membrane.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease underlying different medical processes, being the allergic asthma, with an early-onset in childhood, the most common type. In this phenotype, the continuous exposure to allergens produces a Th2-driven airway remodeling process that leads to symptoms and pathophysiological changes in asthma. Strategies as the avoidance of aeroallergen exposure in early life have been tested to prevent asthma, without a clear success. Alongside, several mouse models of aeroallergen challenge have dissected potential homeostatic responses by which environmental microbial stimulation reduces the subsequent allergic inflammation in the offspring. This suggests the onset of underlying preventive mechanisms in the beginning of asthma that have not been fully recognized. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if neonatal LPS-induced stimulus in epithelial host defenses could contribute to the prevent asthma in adult Balb/c mice. For this purpose, we studied the response of bronchiolar club cells (CC) that are situated in the crossroads of the host defense and allergic inflammation, and express specific pro and antiallergic proteins. LPS stimulus in the neonatal life intensified the production of TLR-4, TNF, and natural anti-allergic products (CCSP and SPD), changes that contributed to prevent asthma triggering in adulthood. At epithelial level, CC skipped the mucous metaplasia, declining the overproduction of mucin via the EGFR pathway and the mice expressed normal breathing patterns in front of OVA challenge. Furthermore, the overexpression of TSLP, an epithelial pro-Th2 cytokine was blunted and normal TSLP and IL-4 levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Complementing this shift, we also detected lower eosinophilia in BAL while an increase in phagocytes as well as in regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ and CD4+IL-10+) was seen, whit an elevation in IL-12 and TNF secretion. Summarizing, our study pointed to stable asthma-preventive effects promoted by neonatal LPS-stimulation; the main finding was the increase of several anti-Th2 specific proteins at epithelial level, together with an important diminution of pro-Th2 TSLP, conditions that promoted changes in the local immune response with Treg. We thus evidenced several anti-allergic dynamic mechanisms overlying in the epithelium that could be favored in an adequate epidemiological environment",

    "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy. Dominant mutations in glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene cause peripheral nerve degeneration and lead to CMT disease type 2D. Mutations in GARS (GARSCMT2D) show partial loss-of-function features, suggesting that tRNA-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we report that wild-type GARS tightly binds the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 and inhibits its deacetylation activity, resulting in the hyperacetylated -tubulin, the major substrate of SIRT2. Previous studies showed that acetylation of -tubulin protects microtubules from mechanical breakage and keep axonal transportation. However, CMT2D mutations in GARS can not inhibit SIRT2 deacetylation, which leads to decrease acetylated -tubulin and severe axonal transport deficits. Genetic reduction of SIRT2 in the Drosophila model rescues the GARS-induced axonal CMT neuropathy and extends the life span. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenic role of SIRT2-dependent -tubulin deacetylation in mutant GARS-induced neuropathies and provide new perspectives for targeting SIRT2 as a potential therapy against hereditary axonopathies.",

    "abstract": "Rhamnose is a constituent of lipo- and capsular polysaccharides, and cell surface glycoproteins. L-rhamnose is biosynthesized by the rml or udp pathway and D-rhamnose by the gdp pathway. Disruption of its biosynthesis affects survival, colonisation, etc. Rhamnosides are commercially important in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. HMM profiles were used to investigate the prevalence of the three pathways in completely sequenced genomes and metagenomes. The three pathways are mutually exclusive except in Pseudomonas which has both rml and gdp pathways. The rml pathway is restricted to bacteria (42% genomes), archaea (21%) and bacteriophages, and absent in eukaryotes and other viruses. The gdp pathway is restricted to Pseudomonas and Aneurinibacillus. The udp pathway is primarily found in plants, fungi and algae, and in human faecal metagenomic samples. The rml pathway is found in >40% genomes of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Crenarchaeota, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria but in <20% genomes of Chlamydiae, Euryarchaeota and Tenericutes. The udp pathway is found in all genomes of Streptophyta, <=25% genomes of Ascomycota and Chordata, and none of the genomes of Arthropoda and Basidiomycota. Some genera which lack any of these pathways are Chlamydia, Helicobacter, Listeria, Mycoplasma, Pasteurella, Rickettsia and Staphylococcus. Organisms such as E. coli and Salmonella enterica showed significant strain-specific differences in the presence/absence of rhamnose pathways. Identification of rhamnose biosynthesis genes facilitates profiling their expression pattern, and in turn, better understanding the physiological role of rhamnose. Knowledge of phylogenetic distribution of biosynthesis pathways helps in fine graining the taxonomic profiling of metagenomes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn the present study, we have investigated the prevalence of rhamnose biosynthesis pathways in completely sequenced genomes and metagenomes. It is observed that the prevalence of rhamnose is highly clade specific: present in all plants but in less than half of all prokaryotes. Among chordates, only the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat has rhamnose biosynthesis pathway and this exclusive presence is quite baffling. The effect of disrupting rhamnose biosynthesis has been reported in a few prokaryotes and all these cases pointed to the essentiality of rhamnose for critical physiological processes such as survival, colonisation, etc. In this background, it is surprising that many of the prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica show significant strain-specific differences in the presence/absence of rhamnose pathway. This study will facilitate the experimental characterization of rhamnose biosynthesis genes in organisms where this pathway has not been characterised yet, eventually leading to the elucidation of the biological role of rhamnose. Phylum-, genus-, species- and strain-level differences found with respect to presence of rhamnose biosynthesis pathway genes can be used as a tool for taxonomic profiling of metagenome samples. This study could also annotate a significant number of orphan proteins in the TrEMBL database.",

    "abstract": "Plant derived fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass have significant potential to replace reliance on petroleum and improve global carbon balance. However, plant biomass contains significant fractions of oligosaccharides that are not usable natively by many industrial microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zymomonas mobilis. Even after chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, some carbohydrate remains as non-metabolizable oligosaccharides (e.g., cellobiose or longer cellulose-derived oligomers), thus reducing the efficiency of conversion to useful products. To begin to address this problem for Z. mobilis, we engineered a strain (Z. mobilis GH3) that expresses a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) with {beta}-glucosidase activity from Caulobacter crescentus and subjected it to an adaptation in cellobiose medium. Growth on cellobiose was achieved after a prolonged lag phase in cellobiose medium that induced changes in gene expression and cell composition, including increased expression and secretion of GH. These changes were reversible upon growth in glucose-containing medium, meaning they did not result from genetic mutation but could be retained upon transfer of cells to fresh cellobiose medium. After adaptation to cellobiose, our GH-expressing strain was able to convert about 50% of cellobiose to glucose within 24 hours and use it for growth and ethanol production. Alternatively, pre-growth of Z. mobilis GH3 in sucrose medium enabled immediate growth on cellobiose. Proteomic analysis of cellobiose- and sucrose-adapted strains revealed upregulation of secretion-, transport-, and outer membrane-related proteins, which may aid secretion or surface display of GHs, entry of cellobiose into the periplasm, or both. Our two key findings are that Z. mobilis can be reprogrammed to grow on cellobiose as a sole carbon source and that this reprogramming is related to a natural response of Z. mobilis to sucrose that enables sucrose secretion.",
