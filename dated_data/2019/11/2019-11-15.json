    "abstract": "The ability of amphipathic polymers to self-assemble with lipids and form nanodiscs has been a boon for the field of functional reconstitution of membrane proteins. In a field dominated by detergent micelles, a unique feature of polymer nanodiscs is their much-desired ability to align in the presence of an external magnetic field. Magnetic alignment facilitates the application of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and aids in the measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) via well-established solution NMR spectroscopy. In this study, we comprehensively investigate the magnetic-alignment properties of SMA-QA polymer based nanodiscs by using 31P and 14N solid-state NMR experiments under static conditions. The results reported herein demonstrate the spontaneous magnetic-alignment of large-size ([&ge;] 20 nm diameter) SMA-QA nanodiscs (also called as macro-nanodiscs) with the lipid-bilayer-normal perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. Consequently, the orientation of macro-nanodiscs are further shown to flip their alignment axis parallel to the magnetic field direction upon the addition of a paramagnetic lanthanide salt. These results demonstrate the use of SMA-QA polymer nanodiscs for solid-state NMR applications including structural studies on membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSymptom expression in a range of psychiatric conditions is linked to altered threat perception, manifesting particularly in uncertain environments. How precise computational mechanisms that support aversive learning, and uncertainty estimation, relate to the presence of specific psychiatric symptoms remains undetermined. 400 subjects completed an online game-based aversive learning task, requiring avoidance of negative outcomes, in conjunction with completing measures of common psychiatric symptoms. We used a probabilistic computational model to measure distinct processes involved in learning, in addition to inferred estimates of safety likelihood and uncertainty, and tested for associations between these variables and traditional psychiatric constructs alongside transdiagnostic dimensions. We used partial least squares regression to identify components of psychopathology grounded in both aversive learning behaviour and symptom self-report. We show that state anxiety and a transdiagnostic compulsivity-related factor are associated with enhanced learning from safety, and data-driven analysis indicated the presence of two separable components across our behavioural and questionnaire data: one linked enhanced safety learning and lower estimated uncertainty to physiological anxiety, compulsivity, and impulsivity; the other linked enhanced threat learning, and heightened uncertainty estimation, to symptoms of depression and social anxiety. Our findings implicate distinct aversive learning processes in the expression of psychiatric symptoms that transcend traditional diagnostic boundaries.",

    "abstract": "A growing focus and continuing challenge for biological sciences is creating representative in vitro environments to study and influence cell behavior. Here, we describe the synthetic recreation of the highly ordered extracellular matrix (ECM) of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in terms of structure and scale, providing a versatile 3D culturing platform that achieves some of the highest in vitro neurite growth rates so far reported. By combining electrospinning technology with a unique multi-material processing sequence that harnesses intrinsic material properties, a hydrogel construct is realized that incorporates oriented 6 m-diameter microchannels decorated with topographical nanofibers. We show that this mimics the native PNS ECM architecture and promotes extensive growth from primary neurons; through controlled variation in design, we show that the open lumens of the microchannels directing rapid axon invasion of the hydrogel while the nanofibers provide essential cues for cell adhesion and topographical guidance. Furthermore, these microstructural and nanofibrillar elements enabled a typically bioinert hydrogel (PEGDA) to achieve similar neurite extension when compared to a biocompatible collagen hydrogel, with PEGDA-based devices approaching neurite growth rates similar to what is observed in vivo. Through the accessible fabrication approach developed here, multi-material scaffolds were designed with cell-relevant architectures ranging from meso-to nanoscale and shown to support nerve growth to mimic PNS regeneration, with potential for regenerative medicine and neural engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "All current highly effective anti-tumor immunotherapeutics depend on the activity of T cells, but tumor cells can escape immune recognition by several mechanisms including loss of function in antigen presentation and inflammatory response genes, expression of immunomodulatory proteins and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In contrast, the comprehensive identification of strategies that sensitize tumor cells to immunotherapy in vivo has remained challenging. Here, we combine a two-cell type (2CT) whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen with dynamic transcriptional analysis (DTA) of tumor upon T cell encounter to identify a set of genes that tumor cells express as an active defense against T cell-mediated killing. We then employed small molecule and biologic screens designed to antagonize gene products employed by tumor cells to actively defend against T cell-mediated tumor destruction and found that the inhibition of BIRC2, ITGAV or DNPEP enhanced tumor cell destruction by T cells. Mechanistically, we found that BIRC2 promoted immunotherapy resistance through inhibiting non-canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling and limiting inflammatory chemokine production. These findings show the path forward to improving T cell-mediated tumor destruction in the clinic.",

Investigation in rodent brain function and organization at the systems level using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has become increasingly popular, owing to its high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage. Due to this rapid progress, shared rodent rsfMRI databases can be of particular interest and importance to the scientific community, as inspired by human neuroscience and psychiatric research that are substantially facilitated by open human neuroimaging datasets. However, such databases in rats are still lacking. In this paper, we share an open rsfMRI database acquired in 90 rats with a well-established awake imaging paradigm that avoids anesthesia interference. Both raw and preprocessed data are made publically available. Procedures in data preprocessing to remove artefacts induced by the scanner, head motion, non-neural physiological noise are described in details.

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have highlighted that corticospinal excitability (CSE) is increased during observation of object lifting, an effect termed  motor resonance. This facilitation is driven by movement features indicative of object weight, such as object size or observed movement kinematics. Here, we investigated in 35 humans (23 females) how motor resonance is altered when the observers weight expectations, based on visual information, do not match the actual object weight as revealed by the observed movement kinematics. Our results highlight that motor resonance is not robustly driven by object weight but easily masked by a suppressive mechanism reflecting the correctness of the weight expectations. Subsequently, we investigated in 24 humans (14 females) whether this suppressive mechanism was driven by higher-order cortical areas. For this, we induced  virtual lesions to either the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) prior to having participants perform the task. Importantly, virtual lesion of pSTS eradicated this suppressive mechanism and restored object weight-driven motor resonance. In addition, DLPFC virtual lesion eradicated any modulation of motor resonance. This indicates that motor resonance is heavily mediated by top-down inputs from both pSTS and DLPFC. Altogether, these findings shed new light on the theorized cortical network driving motor resonance. That is, our findings highlight that motor resonance is not only driven by the putative human mirror neuron network consisting of the primary motor and premotor cortices as well as the anterior intraparietal sulcus, but also by top-down input from pSTS and DLPFC.\n\nSignificance StatementObservation of object lifting activates the observers motor system in a weight-specific fashion: Corticospinal excitability is larger when observing lifts of heavy objects compared to light ones. Interestingly, here we demonstrate that this weight-driven modulation of corticospinal excitability is easily suppressed by the observers expectations about object weight and that this suppression is mediated by the posterior superior temporal sulcus. Thus, our findings show that modulation of corticospinal excitability during observed object lifting is not robust but easily altered by top-down cognitive processes. Finally, our results also indicate how cortical inputs, originating remotely from motor pathways and processing action observation, overlap with bottom-up motor resonance effects.",

While research on sexually dimorphic cognitionoften focuses on performance, it commonly overlooks how sexes diverge across multiple cognitive tasks (cognitive domains) and in behaviors associated with cognitive performance (cognitive style). We tested male and female western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) in three cognitive tasks: associative learning (numerical discrimination), cognitive flexibility (detour task), and spatio-temporal learning (shuttlebox). We characterized statistical relationships between cognitive performances and cognitive style during the associative learning task with measures of anxiety, boldness, exploration, reaction time, and activity. We found sex differences in performance, cognitive style, and the relationships between cognitive domains. Females outperformed males in spatio-temporal learning task, while the sexes performed equally in associate learning and cognitive flexibility assays. Females (but not males) exhibited a  fast-exploratory cognitive style during associative learning trials. Meanwhile, only males showed a significant positive relationship between domains (associative learning and cognitive flexibility). We propose that these sexually dimorphic cognitive traits result from strong sexual conflict in this taxon; and emphasize the need to explore suites of sex-specific cognitive traits and broader comparative work examining sexual selection and cognition.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMales and females perform at similar levels in associative learning and cognitive flexibility assays, but females tend to outperform males on a spatio-temporal learning task.\nC_LIO_LIFemale performance in associative learning trials (numerical discrimination task) can be predicted by cognitive style behaviors (exploration, reaction time, and activity); whereas male performance cannot.\nC_LIO_LIMales, but not females, show a predictive relationship between associative learning and cognitive flexibility performance.\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that sex differences in cognition extend beyond performance into cognitive style and domain relationships, suggesting that investigations into animal personality and cognition require more comprehensive characterization.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Multi-omics approaches focused on mass-spectrometry (MS)-based data, such as metaproteomics, utilize genomic and/or transcriptomic sequencing data to generate a comprehensive protein sequence database. These databases can be very large, containing millions of sequences, which reduces the sensitivity of matching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data to sequences to generate peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). Here, we describe a sectioning method for generating an enriched database for those protein sequences that are most likely present in the sample. Our evaluation demonstrates how this method helps to increase the sensitivity of PSMs while maintaining acceptable false discovery rate statistics. We demonstrate increased true positive PSM identifications using the sectioning method when compared to the traditional large database searching method, whereas it helped in reducing the false PSM identifications when compared to a previously described two-step method for reducing database size. The sectioning method for large sequence databases enables generation of an enriched protein sequence database and promotes increased sensitivity in identifying PSMs, while maintaining acceptable and manageable FDR. Furthermore, implementation in the Galaxy platform provides access to a usable and automated workflow for carrying out the method. Our results show the utility of this methodology for a wide-range of applications where genome-guided, large sequence databases are required for MS-based proteomics data analysis.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of antimicrobial resistance can be strongly affected by variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations. Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of different antimicrobial modes of action.\n\nAuthor summaryAntimicrobials select for resistance, which threatens to make antimicrobials useless. Understanding the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is therefore of crucial importance. Under what circumstances are microbial populations eradicated by antimicrobials? Conversely, when are they rescued by resistance? We address these questions employing a stochastic model that incorporates variations of both population composition and size. We consider periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial, which may model a treatment. We find a threshold period above which the first phase with antimicrobial fully determines the fate of the population. Faster alternations strongly select for resistance, and are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population, unless the death rate induced by the treatment is large enough. For longer alternation periods, we calculate the probability that the microbial population gets eradicated. We further demonstrate the different merits of biostatic antimicrobials, which prevent sensitive microbes from dividing, and of biocidal ones, which kill sensitive microbes.",

    "abstract": "The \"One Health\" framework emphasizes the ecological relationships between soil, plant, animal and human health. Microbiomes play important roles in these relationships, as they modify the health and performance of the different compartments and influence the transfer of energy, matter and chemicals between them. Standardized methods to characterize microbiomes along food chains are, however, currently lacking. To address this methodological gap, we evaluated the performance of DNA extractions kits and commonly recommended primer pairs targeting different hypervariable regions (V3-V4, V4, V5-V6, V5-V6-V7) of the 16S rRNA gene, on microbiome samples along a model food chain, including soils, maize roots, cattle rumen, and cattle and human faeces. We also included faeces from gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined bacterial taxa and mock communities to confirm the robustness of our molecular and bioinformatic approaches on these defined low microbial diversity samples. Based on Amplicon Sequence Variants, the primer pair 515F-806R led to the highest estimates of species richness and diversity in all sample types and offered maximum diversity coverage of reference databases in in silico primer analysis. The influence of the DNA extraction kits was negligible compared to the influence of the choice of primer pairs. Comparing microbiomes using 515F-806R revealed that soil and root samples have the highest estimates of species richness and inter-sample variation. Species richness decreased gradually along the food chain, with the lowest richness observed in human faeces. Primer pair choice directly influenced the estimation of community changes (beta diversity) within and across compartments and may give rise to preferential detection of specific taxa. This work demonstrates why a standardized approach is necessary to analyse microbiomes within and between source compartments along food chains in the context of the One Health framework.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen. The organism displays elevated intrinsic antibiotic resistance and can cause life-threatening infections. The gene encoding an elongation factor, FusA1, is frequently mutated in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent work has shown that fusA1 mutants often display elevated aminoglycoside resistance due to increased expression of the aminoglycoside efflux pump, MexXY. In the current work, we isolated a spontaneous gentamicin-resistant fusA1 mutant (FusA1P443L) in which mexXY expression was increased. Through a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we found that the fusA1 mutant also exhibited large-scale but discrete changes in the expression of key pathogenicity-associated genes. Most notably, the fusA1 mutant displayed greatly increased expression of the Type III Secretion system (T3SS), widely considered to be the most potent virulence factor in the P. aeruginosa arsenal, and also elevated expression of the Type VI Secretion (T6S) machinery. This was unexpected because expression of the T3SS is usually reciprocally coordinated with T6S system expression. The fusA1 mutant also displayed elevated exopolysaccharide production, dysregulated siderophore production, elevated ribosomal protein synthesis, and transcriptomic signatures indicative of translational stress. Each of these phenotypes (and almost all of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with the fusA1 mutation) were restored to levels comparable to that in the PAO1-derived progenitor strain by expression of the wild-type fusA1 gene in trans, indicating that the mutant gene is recessive. Our data show that in addition to elevating antibiotic resistance through mexXY expression (although we also identify additional contributory resistance mechanisms), mutations in fusA1 can lead to highly-selective dysregulation of virulence gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. To assess the impact of this flexibility on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, the same dataset was independently analyzed by 70 teams, testing nine ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytic approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyze the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in hypothesis test results, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of their analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Importantly, meta-analytic approaches that aggregated information across teams yielded significant consensus in activated regions across teams. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset. Our findings show that analytic flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and demonstrate factors related to variability in fMRI. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive division of labor (e.g., germ-soma specialization) is a hallmark of the evolution of multicellularity, signifying the emergence of a new type of individual and facilitating the evolution of increased organismal complexity. A large body of work from evolutionary biology, economics, and ecology has shown that specialization is beneficial when further division of labor produces an accelerating increase in absolute productivity (i.e., productivity is a convex function of specialization). Here we show that reproductive specialization is qualitatively different from classical models of resource sharing, and can evolve even when the benefits of specialization are saturating (i.e., productivity is a concave function of specialization). Through analytical theory and evolutionary individual based simulations, our work demonstrates that reproductive specialization is strongly favored in sparse networks of cellular interactions, such as trees and filaments, that reflect the morphology of early, simple multicellular organisms, highlighting the importance of restricted social interactions in the evolution of reproductive specialization. More broadly, we find that specialization is strongly favored, despite saturating returns on investment, in a wide range of scenarios in which sharing is asymmetric.",

    "abstract": "Spiral fMRI has been put forward as a viable alternative to rectilinear echo-planar imaging, in particular due to its enhanced average k-space speed and thus high acquisition efficiency. This renders spirals attractive for contemporary fMRI applications that require high spatiotemporal resolution, such as laminar or columnar fMRI. However, in practice, spiral fMRI is typically hampered by its reduced robustness and ensuing blurring artifacts, which arise from imperfections in both static and dynamic magnetic fields.\n\nRecently, these limitations have been overcome by the concerted application of an expanded signal model that accounts for such field imperfections, and its inversion by iterative image reconstruction. In the challenging ultra-high field environment of 7 Tesla, where field inhomogeneity effects are aggravated, both multi-shot and single-shot 2D spiral imaging at sub-millimeter resolution was demonstrated with high depiction quality and anatomical congruency.\n\nIn this work, we further these advances towards a time series application of spiral readouts, namely, single-shot spiral BOLD fMRI at 0.8 mm in-plane resolution. We demonstrate that high-resolution spiral fMRI at 7 T is not only feasible, but delivers both excellent image quality, BOLD sensitivity, and spatial specificity of the activation maps, with little artifactual blurring. Furthermore, we show the versatility of the approach with a combined in/out spiral readout at a more typical resolution (1.5 mm), where the high acquisition efficiency allows to acquire two images per shot for improved sensitivity by echo combination.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThis work reports the first fMRI study at 7T with high-resolution spiral readout gradient waveforms.\nC_LIO_LIWe achieve spiral fMRI with sub-millimeter resolution (0.8 mm, FOV 230 mm), acquired in a single shot (36 slices in 3.3 s).\nC_LIO_LISpiral images exhibit intrinsic geometric congruency to anatomical scans, and spatially specific activation patterns.\nC_LIO_LIImage reconstruction rests on a signal model expanded by measured trajectories and static field maps, inverted by cg-SENSE.\nC_LIO_LIWe assess generalizability of the approach for spiral in/out readouts, providing two images per shot (1.5 mm resolution).\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Research has established a link between presence and cybersickness in virtual environments, but there is significant disagreement regarding the directionality of the relationship (positive or negative) between the two factors, and if the relationship is modulated by other top-down influences. Several studies have revealed a negative association between the factors, highlighting the prospect that manipulating one factor might affect the other. Here we examined if a top-down factor (narrative context) enhances presence, and whether this effect is associated with a decrease in cybersickness. We analyzed the association between responses to questionnaire measures of cybersickness and presence, as well as the degree to which their relationship was affected by the administration of an  enriched or  minimal verbal narrative context. The results of the first experiment, conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, revealed that enriched narrative was associated with increased presence, but that the reductive effect of narrative on cybersickness depended on video gaming experience. We also observed the expected negative association between presence and cybersickness, but only in the enriched narrative group. In a second experiment, conducted with a diverse sample at a public museum, we confirmed our previous finding that presence and cybersickness are negatively correlated, specifically when participants experienced an enriched narrative. We also confirmed the interaction between narrative and gaming experience with respect to cybersickness. These results highlight the complexity of the presence-cybersickness relationship, and confirm that both factors can be modulated in a beneficial manner for virtual reality users by means of top-down interventions.",

    "abstract": "The population of hippocampal neurons actively coding space continually changes across days as mice repeatedly perform tasks. Many hippocampal place cells become inactive while other previously silent neurons become active, challenging the belief that stable behaviors and memory representations are supported by stable patterns of neural activity. Active cell replacement may disambiguate unique episodes that contain overlapping memory cues, and could contribute to reorganization of memory representations. How active cell replacement affects the evolution of representations of different behaviors within a single task is unknown. We trained mice to perform a Delayed Non-Match to Place (DNMP) task over multiple weeks, and performed calcium imaging in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus using head-mounted miniature microscopes. Cells active on the central stem of the maze \"split\" their calcium activity according to the animals upcoming turn direction (left or right), the current task phase (study or test), or both task dimensions, even while spatial cues remained unchanged. We found that different splitter neuron populations were replaced at unequal rates, resulting in an increasing number of cells modulated by turn direction and a decreasing number of cells with combined modulation by both turn direction and task phase. Despite continual reorganization, the ensemble code stably segregated these task dimensions. These results show that hippocampal memories can heterogeneously reorganize even while behavior is unchanging.\n\nSignificance statementSingle photon calcium imaging using head-mounted miniature microscopes in freely moving animals, has enabled researchers to measure the long term stability of hippocampal pyramidal cells during repeated behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated instability of neural circuit components including dendritic spines and axonal boutons. It is now known that single units in the neuronal population exhibiting behaviorally relevant activity eventually become inactive and that previously silent neurons can quickly acquire task-relevant activity. The function of such population dynamics is unknown. We show here that population dynamics differ for cells coding distinct task dimensions, suggesting such dynamics are part of a mechanism for latent memory reorganization. These results add to a growing body of work showing that maintenance of episodic memory is an ongoing and dynamic process.",

Here, in striking similarity to other neurodegenerative diseases, we identify in postmortem human MS tissue and in nonhuman primate and mouse MS models profound synapse loss and microglial synaptic engulfment. These events can occur independently of local demyelination, neuronal degeneration, and peripheral immune cell infiltration, but coincide with gliosis and increased localization of complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Finally, we use AAV9 to overexpress the complement inhibitor Crry at activated C3-bound synapses in mice and demonstrate robust protection of synapses and visual function. These results mechanistically dissect synapse loss as an early pathology in MS. We further provide a novel gene therapy approach to prevent synapse loss by microglia, which may be broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B (CMT4B) disease caused by mutations in myotubularin-related 5 (MTMR5; also called SET Binding Factor 1; SBF1) shows a spectrum of axonal and demyelinating nerve phenotypes. This contrasts with the CMT4B subtypes caused by MTMR2 or MTMR13 (SBF2) mutations, which are characterized by myelin outfoldings and classic demyelination. Thus, it is unclear whether MTMR5 plays an analogous or distinct role from that of its homolog, MTMR13, in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). MTMR5 and MTMR13 are pseudophosphatases predicted to regulate endosomal trafficking by activating Rab GTPases and binding to the phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase MTMR2. In the mouse PNS, Mtmr2 was required to maintain wild type levels of Mtmr5 and Mtmr13, suggesting that these factors function in discrete protein complexes. Genetic elimination of both Mtmr5 and Mtmr13 in mice led to perinatal lethality, indicating that the two proteins have partially redundant functions during embryogenesis. Loss of Mtmr5 in mice did not cause CMT4B-like myelin outfoldings. However, adult Mtmr5-/- mouse nerves contained fewer myelinated axons than control nerves, likely as a result of axon radial sorting defects. Mtmr5 levels were highest during axon radial sorting, whereas Mtmr13 levels rose as myelin formed, and remained high through adulthood. Our findings suggest that Mtmr5 and Mtmr13 ensure proper axon radial sorting and Schwann cell myelination, respectively, perhaps through their direct interactions with Mtmr2. This study enhances our understanding of the non-redundant roles of the endosomal regulators MTMR5 and MTMR13 during normal peripheral nerve development and disease.",

Here, we report that a vaccine focusing the immune response on the sequences surrounding the 12 viral protease cleavage sites (PCSs) provides greater than 80% protection of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs) against repeated intravaginal SIVmac251 challenges. The PCS-specific T cell responses are correlated with vaccine efficacy. The PCS vaccine does not induce immune activation and inflammation known to be associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection. Machine learning analyses revealed that the immune environment generated by the PCS vaccine predicts vaccine efficacy. Our study demonstrates for the first time that a novel vaccine which targets viral maturation, but lacks full Env and Gag proteins as immunogens, can prevent intravaginal infection in a highly stringent NHP/SIV challenge model. Targeting HIV maturation thus offers a novel approach to developing an effective HIV vaccine.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe anti-PCS T cell responses and the immune environment induced by the novel PCS vaccine are key correlates of vaccine efficacy",

    "abstract": "Negativity bias is a core feature of depression that is associated with dysfunctional frontoamygdalar connectivity; this pathway is associated with emotion regulation and sensitive to neurobiological change during puberty. We used a valence bias task (ratings of emotional ambiguity) as a potential early indicator of depression risk and differences in frontoamygdalar connectivity. Previous work using this task demonstrated that children normatively have a negative bias that attenuates with maturation. Here, we test the hypothesis that persistence of this negativity bias as manturation ensues may reveal differences in emotion regulation development, and may be associated with increased risk for depression. Within a restricted age range (6-13 years), we tested the moderating role of puberty on relationships between valence bias, depressive symptoms, and frontoamygdalar connectivity. A negative bias was associated with increased depressive symptoms for those at more advanced pubertal stages (within this sample) and less regulatory frontoamygdalar connectivity, whereas a more positive bias was associated with more regulatory connectivity patterns. These data suggest that with maturation, individual differences in positivity biases and associated emotion regulation circuitry confer a differential risk for depression. Longitudinal work is necessary to determine the directionality of these effects and explore the influence of early life events.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying cybersickness during virtual reality (VR) exposure is still poorly understood, although research has highlighted a causal role for visual-vestibular sensory conflict. Recently established methods for reducing cybersickness include galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to mimic absent vestibular cues in VR, or vibration of the vestibular organs to add noise to the sensory modality. Here, we examined if applying noise to the vestibular system using noisy-current GVS also affects sickness severity in VR. Participants were exposed to one of two VR games that were classified as either moderate or intense with respect to their nauseogenic effects. The VR content lasted for 50 minutes and was broken down into 3 blocks: 30 minutes of gameplay during exposure to either noisy GVS ({+/-}1750 A) or sham stimulation (0 A), and 10 minutes of gameplay before and after this block. We characterized the effects of noisy GVS in terms of post-minus-pre-exposure cybersickness scores. For the intense VR content, we found a main effect of noisy vestibular stimulation. Participants reported lower cybersickness scores during and directly after exposure to GVS. However, this difference was quickly extinguished ([~]3-6 min) after further exposure to VR, indicating that sensory adaptation did not persist after stimulation was terminated. In contrast, there were no differences between the sham and GVS group for the moderate VR content. The results show the potential for reducing cybersickness with simple non-invasive sensory stimulation. We discuss the prospect that noise-induced sensory re-weighting is responsible for the observed effects, and address other possible mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been widely used to characterize cellular status but it relies on second strand cDNA synthesis to generate initial material for library preparation. Here we use bacterial transposase Tn5, which has been increasingly used in various high-throughput DNA analyses, to construct RNA-seq libraries without second strand synthesis. We show that Tn5 transposome can randomly bind RNA/DNA heteroduplexes and add sequencing adapters onto RNA directly after reverse transcription. This method, Sequencing HEteRo RNA-DNA-hYbrid (SHERRY), is versatile and scalable. SHERRY accepts a wide range of starting materials, from bulk RNA to single cells. SHERRY offers a greatly simplified protocol, and produces results with higher reproducibility and GC uniformity compared with prevailing RNA-seq methods.\n\nSignificance StatementRNA sequencing is widely used to measure gene expression in biomedical research; therefore, improvements in the simplicity and accuracy of the technology are desirable. All existing RNA sequencing methods rely on the conversion of RNA into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription followed by second strand synthesis. The latter step requires additional enzymes and purification, and introduces sequence-dependent bias. Here, we show that Tn5 transposase, which randomly binds and cuts double-stranded DNA, can directly fragment and prime the RNA/DNA heteroduplexes generated by reverse transcription. The primed fragments are then subject to PCR amplification. This provides a new approach for simple and accurate RNA characterization and quantification.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules undergo a vast array of chemical post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) that can affect their structure and interaction properties. To date, over 150 naturally occurring PTMs have been identified, however the overwhelming majority of their functions remain elusive. In recent years, a small number of PTMs have been successfully mapped to the transcriptome using experimental approaches relying on high-throughput sequencing. Oxford Nanopore direct-RNA sequencing (DRS) technology has been shown to be sensitive to RNA modifications. We developed and validated Nanocompore, a robust analytical framework to evaluate the presence of modifications in DRS data. To do so, we compare an RNA sample of interest against a non-modified control sample. Our strategy does not require a training set and allows the use of replicates to model biological variability. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Nanocompore to detect RNA modifications at single-molecule resolution in human polyA+ RNAs, as well as in targeted non-coding RNAs. Our results correlate well with orthogonal methods, confirm previous observations on the distribution of N6-methyladenosine sites and provide novel insights into the distribution of RNA modifications in the coding and non-coding transcriptomes.

    "abstract": "Long Undecoded Transcript Isoforms (LUTIs) represent a class of non-canonical mRNAs that downregulate gene expression through the combined act of transcriptional and translational repression. While single gene studies revealed some important aspects of LUTI-based repression, how these features impact gene regulation at a global scale is unknown. By using transcript leader and direct RNA sequencing, here we identify 74 LUTI candidates that are expressed specifically during meiotic prophase. Translational repression of these candidates is ubiquitous and dependent on upstream open reading frames. However, LUTI-based transcriptional repression is highly variable. In only 50% of the cases, LUTI transcription causes downregulation of the protein-coding transcript isoform. Higher LUTI expression, enrichment of histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation, and changes in nucleosome position are the strongest predictors of LUTI-based transcriptional repression. We conclude that LUTIs downregulate gene expression in a manner that integrates translational repression, chromatin state changes, and the magnitude of LUTI expression.",

    "abstract": "The primary auditory cortex (A1) plays a key role for sound perception since it represents one of the first cortical processing stations for sounds. Recent studies have shown that on the cellular level the frequency organization of A1 is more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. However, many of these studies were performed in mice on the C57BL/6 background which develop high frequency hearing loss with age making them a less optimal choice for auditory research. In contrast, mice on the CBA background retain better hearing sensitivity in old age. Since potential strain differences could exist in A1 organization between strains, we performed comparative analysis of neuronal populations in A1 of adult (~10 weeks) C57BL/6 mice and CBAxC57 F1 mice. We used in vivo 2-photon imaging of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers L4 and L2/3 of awake mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) to characterize the populations of neurons that were active to tonal stimuli. Pure tones recruited neurons of widely ranging frequency preference in both layers and strains with neurons in CBA mice exhibiting a wider range of frequency preference particularly to higher frequencies. Frequency selectivity was slightly higher in C57BL/6 mice while neurons in CBA mice showed a greater sound-level sensitivity. The spatial heterogeneity of frequency preference was present in both strains with CBA mice exhibiting higher tuning diversity across all measured length scales. Our results demonstrate that the tone evoked responses and frequency representation in A1 of adult C57BL/6 and CBAxC57 F1 mice is largely similar.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of single neurons can be described by a broad spectrum of models, from the most realistic Hodgkin-Huxley type models with numerous detailed mechanisms to the phenomeno-logical models. The Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) model has emerged as a convenient \"middle-ground\" model. With a low computational cost, but keeping biophysical interpretation of the parameters, it has been extensively used for simulations of large neural networks. However, because of its current-based adaptation, it can generate unrealistic behaviors. We show the limitations of the AdEx model and to avoid them, we introduce the Conductance-based Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire model (CAdEx). We give an analysis of the dynamics of the CAdEx model and show the variety of firing patterns it can produce. We propose the CAdEx model as a richer alternative to perform network simulations with simplified models reproducing neuronal intrinsic properties.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTTheropod dinosaurs were relatively scarce in the Late Cretaceous ecosystems of southeast Brazil. Instead, hypercarnivorous crocodyliforms known as baurusuchids were abundant and probably occupied the ecological role of apex predators. Baurusuchids exhibited a series of morphological adaptations hypothesised to be associated with this ecological role, but quantitative biomechanical analyses of their morphology have so far been lacking. Here, we employ a biomechanical modelling approach, applying finite element analysis (FEA) to models of the skull and mandibles of a baurusuchid specimen. This allowed us to characterise the craniomandibular apparatus of baurusuchids, as well as to compare the functional morphology of the group to that of other archosaurian carnivores, such as theropods and crocodylians. Our results support the ecological role of baurusuchids as specialised apex predators in the continental Late Cretaceous ecosystems of South America. With a relatively weak bite force (\u223c600 N), baurusuchids\u2019 predation strategies likely relied on other morphological specializations, such as ziphodont dentition and strong cervical musculature. Comparative assessments of the stress distribution and magnitude of scaled models of other predators (the theropod Allosaurus fragilis and the living crocodylian Alligator mississippiensis) consistently show different responses to loadings under the same functional scenarios, suggesting distinct predatory behaviours for these animals. The unique selective pressures in the arid to semi-arid Late Cretaceous ecosystems of southeast Brazil, which were dominated by crocodyliforms, possibly drove the emergence and evolution of the biomechanical features seen in baurusuchids, which are distinct from those previously reported for other predatory taxa.View Full Text",

Selective advantage of pleomorphic virus structure is apparent only in vivo, hindering functional characterization of distinct particle shapes. Here we sought to mimic the in vivo pressures on virus entry in cultured cells and in single-particle experiments of membrane fusion for influenza virus preparations enriched in spherical or filamentous particles. We show that filamentous shape confers functional advantage in the presence of neutralizing antibodies or fusion inhibitors and in cases of only limited fusion-protein activation. For very long particles, inactivation of >95% of associated fusion proteins still permits enough active-protein cooperation to induce membrane merger. Experiments with Ebola virus-like particles show that resistance to antibody pressure is a conserved feature of filamentous particles. Our results offer a strategy for averting drug resistance or immune evasion by targeting filamentous virus particles.",

We compared neuronal spikes and fluorescence in matched neural populations in behaving mice. We report multiple discrepancies between analyses performed on the two types of data, which were only partially resolved by spike inference algorithms applied to fluorescence. To model the relation between spiking and fluorescence we simultaneously recorded spikes and fluorescence from individual neurons. Using these recordings we developed a model transforming spike trains to synthetic-imaging data. The model recapitulated the differences in analyses. Our analysis highlights challenges in relating electrophysiology and imaging data, and suggests forward modeling as an effective way to understand differences between these data.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn new skills and to store them as memory entities is one of the most impressive features of higher evolved organisms. However, not all memories are created equal; some are short-lived forms, and some are longer lasting. Formation of the latter is energetically costly and by the reason of restricted availability of food or fluctuations in energy expanses, efficient metabolic homeostasis modulating different needs like survival, growth, reproduction, or investment in longer lasting memories is crucial. Whilst equipped with cellular and molecular pre-requisites for formation of a protein synthesis dependent long-term memory (LTM), its existence in the larval stage of Drosophila remains elusive. Considering it from the viewpoint that larval brain structures are completely rebuilt during metamorphosis, and that this process depends completely on accumulated energy stores formed during the larval stage, investing in LTM represents an unnecessary expenditure. However, as an alternative, Drosophila larvae are equipped with the capacity to form a protein synthesis independent so-called larval anaesthesia resistant memory (lARM), which is consolidated in terms of being insensitive to cold-shock treatments. Motivated by the fact that LTM formation causes an increase in energy uptake in Drosophila adults, we tested the idea of whether an energy surplus can induce the formation of LTM in the larval stage. Indeed, increasing the metabolic state by feeding Drosophila larvae the disaccharide sucrose directly before aversive olfactory conditioning led to the formation of a larval LTM (lLTM). Moreover, we show that the metabolic state acts as a binary switch between the formation of lARM and lLTM. Based on this finding, we determined that it is the insulin receptor (InR) expressed in the mushroom body Kenyon cells (MB KCs) that mediates this switch to favor the formation of lLTM under energy-rich circumstances and lARM under energy-poor circumstances.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe previously reported on the role of pericyte-like cells as functional sentinel immune cells in lung injury. However, much about the biological role of pericytes in lung injury remains unknown. Lung pericyte-like cells are well-positioned to sense disruption to the epithelial barrier and coordinate local inflammatory responses due to their anatomic niche within the alveoli. In this report, we characterized transcriptional responses and functional changes in pericyte-like cells following activation by alveolar components from injured and uninjured lungs in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI).\n\nMethodsWe purified pericyte-like cells from lung digests using PDGFR{beta} as a selection marker and expanded them in culture as previously described (1). We induced sterile acute lung injury in mice with recombinant human Fas ligand (rhFasL) instillation followed by mechanical ventilation (1). We then collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from injured and uninjured mice. Purified pericyte-like cells in culture were exposed to growth media only (control), BALF from uninjured mice, and BALF from injured mice for 6 and 24 h. RNA collected from these treatment conditions were processed for RNAseq. Targets of interest identified by pathway analysis were validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.\n\nResultsWe observed robust global transcriptional changes in pericyte-like cells following treatment with uninjured and injured BALF at 6 h, but this response persisted for 24 h only after exposure to injured BALF. Functional enrichment analysis of pericytes treated with injured BALF revealed activation of immuno-inflammatory, cell migration and angiogenesis-related pathways, whereas processes associated with tissue development and remodeling were down-regulated. We validated select targets in the inflammatory, angiogenesis-related, and cell migratory pathways using functional biological assays in vitro and in vivo.\n\nConclusionLung pericyte-like cells are highly responsive to alveolar compartment content from both uninjured and injured lungs, but injured BALF elicits a more sustained response. The inflammatory, angiogenic, and migratory changes exhibited by activated pericyte-like cells underscore the phenotypic plasticity of these specialized stromal cells in the setting of acute lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Introduced species are a common feature of modern plant communities and experience environmental challenges alongside native species. Changes to the environment may reveal distinct species-environment relationships for native and introduced components of plant communities. Extreme environmental change, such as drought, is predicted to result in declines in native species and increased opportunities for invasion, but empirical support for these ideas remains mixed. We tested for differences in the response of native and invaded species to environmental changes by analyzing a longterm dataset of species abundance in California grasslands collected during a period of severe drought. Sampling sites included a combination of stressful serpentine soils, which are resilient against invasion and maintain diverse native species assemblages, and more benign nonserpentine soils, which are heavily invaded and harbor low levels of native species cover. We found a significant correlation between sampling year and species composition for nonserpentine sites, but not for serpentine sites. These patterns were repeated when only introduced species were included in the analysis but no pattern of change was found for native species. The species most strongly associated with directional change on nonserpentine soils were three invasive Eurasian grasses, Bromus hordaceus, Taeniatherium caput-medusae, and Avena fatua. Differences in species composition on both serpentine and nonserpentine soils were significantly correlated with specific leaf area, a trait which has been linked to drought tolerance in these communities, although changes in abundance for the three Eurasian grasses most strongly associated with change did not consistently follow this pattern. Our analyses indicate relatively stable native community composition and strong directional change in introduced species composition, contradicting predictions for how native and introduced species will respond to environmental shifts, but supporting the hypothesis that native and invading species groups have important functional differences that shape their relationships to the environment.",

Here we put the Local Combination Detector, Lexicon, and Interactive accounts to the test, using a combination of event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We do so using both pseudoword and reversed radical false word manipulations with Chinese characters, making use of its special properties. We recorded event-related potentials with 68 channels while twenty native Chinese speakers were making rhyme and meaning judgments on single Chinese characters and BOLD signals were collected in a 3T magnet using multi-plane EPI with a further fifteen native Chinese speakers. The word N170 showed a prolongation for reversed radical false characters while the VWFA also showed an effect of reversal, albeit only for pseudocharacters. Furthermore, an N450 rhyming effect was observed in the phonological task compared to the semantic task, but only via an interaction with reversal. The source analysis of the N450 co-registered with a Supplementary Motor Area activation. The combination of these observations suggests that the ventral orthographic pathway is partially order insensitive and that full phonological encoding occurs relatively late, supporting and expanding a model of dyslexia. Overall, they best support a version of the Lexicon account of the VWFA.",

We analyze 9 empirical data sets about individualized leading-following (L/F) events, to infer rules that likely determine the formation of L/F pairs. To test these rules, we propose five models that differ regarding the empirical information taken into account to form L/F pairs: activity of a bat in exploring possible roosts, tendency to lead and to follow. The comparison with empirical data was done by constructing social networks from the observed L/F events, on which centralities were calculated to quantify the importance of individuals in these L/F networks. The centralities from the empirical network are then compared for statistical differences with the model-generated centralities obtained from 105 model realizations. We find that two models perform well in comparison with the empirical data: One model assumes an individual tendency to lead, but chooses followers at random. The other model assumes an individual tendency to follow and chooses leaders according to their overall activity. We note that neither individual preferences for specific individuals, nor other influences such as kinship or reciprocity, are taken into account to reproduce the empirical findings.",

Our results reveal that the climbing perch did not show any significant preference or aversion to any of the stimulus shoals when unfamiliar monospecific shoals of tilapia, mixed-species shoals of tilapia and climbing perch that were divergent in the composition, or groups comprising only tilapia familiar to the subject fish for a duration of 30, 60, 90 or 120 days, were presented in opposition to a shoal with an equal number of unfamiliar conspecific individuals. No preference for isolated familiar individual tilapia was also observed against its unfamiliar counterpart or a conspecific individual. It is also noteworthy that the propensity of subject climbing perch to initiate exploration of a novel area (a measure of boldness) or exploratory activity and its sociability remained unchanged under different social conditions, including presence of unfamiliar conspecific, familiar conspecific, unfamiliar heterospecific or familiar heterospecific individuals. These results are discussed in the light of ever-increasing levels of invasion by alien fish species and the struggle for survival that currently confront native piscine species in most tropical freshwater ecosystems globally.",

    "abstract": "CXCR4 overexpression in solid tumors has been strongly associated with poor prognosis and adverse clinical outcome. However, CXCR4 signaling inhibitor drug Plerixafor has shown limited clinical success in cancer treatment. Therefore, CXCR4 signaling may not be the exclusive contributor to its pro-tumorigenic functions. In our continuous effort to understand the chemokine receptor signaling inhibition as cancer therapy, here we unexpectedly discovered that instead of its signaling, intracellular CXCR4 protein augments therapy resistance and pro-tumorigenic functions. Unbiased proteome profiler apoptosis array followed by immunoblot, FACS, real-time PCR and ChIP analyses demonstrate that CXCR4 promotes DR5 downregulation via modulating differential recruitment of transcription factors p53 and YY1 to its promoter. Surprisingly, inhibiting CXCR4 mediated signals failed to block the above phenotype. Irrespective of CXCR4 surface expression, its loss compromised colon tumor growth in vivo. Finally, TCGA data mining and human patient sample data analysis showed CXCR4 and DR5 are inversely regulated in human cancers. Together, we showed evidence for the first time that targeting CXCR4 intracellular protein may be critical to dampen the pro-tumorigenic functions of CXCR4.",

    "abstract": "The formation of the craniofacial skeleton is a highly dynamic process that requires proper orchestration of various cellular processes in cranial neural crest cell (cNCC) development, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, polarity and cell death. Alterations that occur during cNCC development result in congenital birth defects and craniofacial abnormalities such as cleft lip with or without cleft palate. While the gene regulatory networks facilitating neural crest development have been extensively studied, the epigenetic mechanisms by which these pathways are activated or repressed in a temporal and spatially regulated manner remain largely unknown. Chromatin modifers can precisely modify gene expression through a variety of mechanisms including histone modifications such as methylation. Here, we investigated the role of two members of the PRDM (Positive regulatory domain) histone methyltransferase family, Prdm3 and Prdm16 in craniofacial development using genetic models in zebrafish and mice. Loss of prdm3 or prdm16 in zebrafish causes craniofacial defects including hypoplasia of the craniofacial cartilage elements, undefined posterior ceratobranchials, and decreased mineralization of the parasphenoid. In mice, while conditional loss of Prdm3 in the early embryo proper causes mid-gestation lethality, loss of Prdm16 caused craniofacial defects including anterior mandibular hypoplasia, clefting in the secondary palate and severe middle ear defects. In zebrafish, prdm3 and prdm16 compensate for each other as well as a third Prdm family member, prdm1a. Combinatorial loss of prdm1a, prdm3, and prdm16 alleles results in severe hypoplasia of the anterior cartilage elements, abnormal formation of the jaw joint, complete loss of the posterior ceratobranchials, and clefting of the ethmoid plate. We further determined that loss of prdm3 and prdm16 reduces methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (repression) and histone 3 lysine 4 (activation) in zebrafish. In mice, loss of Prdm16 significantly decreased histone 3 lysine 9 methylation in the palatal shelves but surprisingly did not change histone 3 lysine 4 methylation. Taken together, Prdm3 and Prdm16 play an important role in craniofacial development by maintaining temporal and spatial regulation of gene regulatory networks necessary for proper cNCC development and these functions are both conserved and divergent across vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress has been made in identifying genomic regions implicated in trait evolution on a microevolutionary scale in many species, but whether these are relevant over macroevolutionary time remains unclear. Here, we directly address this fundamental question using bird beak shape, a key evolutionary innovation linked to patterns of resource use, divergence and speciation, as a model trait. We integrate class-wide geometric-morphometric analyses with evolutionary sequence analyses of 10,322 protein coding genes as well as 229,001 genomic regions spanning 72 species. We identify 1,434 protein coding genes and 39,806 noncoding regions for which molecular rates were significantly related to rates of bill shape evolution. We show that homologs of the identified protein coding genes as well as genes in close proximity to the identified noncoding regions are involved in craniofacial embryo development in mammals. They are associated with embryonic stem cells pathways, including BMP and Wnt signalling, both of which have repeatedly been implicated in the morphological development of avian beaks. This suggests that identifying genotype-phenotype association on a genome wide scale over macroevolutionary time is feasible. While the coding and noncoding gene sets are associated with similar pathways, the actual genes are highly distinct, with significantly reduced overlap between them and bill-related phenotype associations specific to noncoding loci. Evidence for signatures of recent diversifying selection on our identified noncoding loci in Darwin finch populations further suggests that regulatory rather than coding changes are major drivers of morphological diversification over macroevolutionary times.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral interference between species can influence a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we test foundational hypotheses regarding the origins and maintenance of interspecific territoriality, and evaluate the role of interspecific territoriality and hybridization in shaping species distributions and transitions from parapatry to sympatry in sister species of North American perching birds (Passeriformes). We found that interspecific territoriality is pervasive among sympatric sister species pairs, and that interspecifically territorial species pairs have diverged more recently than sympatric non-interspecifically territorial pairs. None of the foundational hypotheses alone explain the observed patterns of interspecific territoriality, but our results support the idea that some cases of interspecific territoriality arise from misdirected intraspecific aggression while others are evolved responses to resource competition. The combination of interspecific territoriality and hybridization appears to be an unstable state associated with parapatry, while species that are interspecifically territorial and do not hybridize are able to achieve extensive fine- and coarse-scale breeding range overlap. In sum, these results suggest that interspecific territoriality has multiple origins and that interspecific territoriality and hybridization together can have striking impacts on species ranges.",

Syk inhibition downregulated expression of ROS/RNS-generating enzymes by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa?B) signaling pathway and phagocytic activity by suppressing suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) via its nitration in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Inhibition of ROS/RNS generation suppressed SOCS1 nitration, leading to a decrease in the phagocytic activity. Syk was activated by the interaction with MyD88, and the tyrosine 58 residue (Y58) in the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of MyD88 was critical for interaction and consequent activation of Syk in macrophages. Src activated MyD88 by phosphorylation at Y58 via the Src kinase domain. Moreover, LPS-induced formation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation induced Src activation.

    "abstract": "Transcription termination defines RNA 3'-ends and guarantees programmed transcriptomes, thus is an essential biological process for life. However, transcription termination mechanisms remain almost unknown in Archaea. Here reported the first general transcription termination factor of Archaea, the conserved ribonuclease aCPSF1, and elucidated its 3'-end cleavage dependent termination mechanism. Depletion of Mmp-aCPSF1 in a methanoarchaeon Methanococcus maripaludis caused a genome-wide transcription termination defect and overall transcriptome chaos, and cold-sensitive growth. Transcript-3'end-sequencing (Term-seq) revealed transcriptions mostly terminated downstream of a uridine-rich terminator motif, where Mmp-aCPSF1 performed cleavage. The endoribonuclease activity was determined essential to terminate transcription in vivo as well. Through super-resolution photoactivated localization microscopy imaging, co-immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that Mmp-aCPSF1 localizes within nucleoid and associates with RNAP and chromosomes. aCPSF1 appears to co-evolve with archaeal RNAPs, and two distant orthologs each from Lokiarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota could replace Mmp-aCPSF1 to termination transcription. Thus, aCPSF1 dependent termination mechanism could be universally employed in Archaea, including Lokiarchaeota, one supposed archaeal ancestor of Eukaryotes. Therefore, the reported aCPSF1 cleavage-dependent termination mode not only hints an archetype of Eukaryotic 3'-end processing/cleavage triggered RNAP II termination, but also would shed lights on understanding the complex eukaryotic termination based on the simplified archaeal model.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni causes acute gastroenteritis world-wide and is transmitted primarily through poultry, in which it is often a commensal member of the intestinal microbiota. Previous RNASeq experiments showed that transcripts from an operon encoding a high affinity phosphate transporter (PstSCAB) of C. jejuni were among the most abundant when grown in chickens. Elevated levels of the pstSCAB mRNA were also identified in an RNASeq experiment from human infection studies. In this study, we explore the role of PstSCAB in the biology and colonization potential of C. jejuni. Our experimental results demonstrate that cells lacking PstSCAB survive poorly in stationary phase, nutrient-limiting media, and under osmotic conditions reflective of those in the chicken. Polyphosphate levels in the mutant cells were elevated at stationary phase, consistent with alterations in expression of polyphosphate metabolism genes. C. jejuni were highly attenuated in colonization of newly hatched chicks, recovered at levels several orders of magnitude below wild type. Mutant and wild type grew similarly in complex media but the pstSCAB mutant exhibited a significant growth defect in minimal media supplemented with L-lactate, postulated as a carbon source in vivo. Poor growth in lactate correlated with diminished expression of acetogenesis pathway genes previously demonstrated as important for colonizing chickens. The phosphate transport system is thus essential for diverse aspects of C. jejuni physiology and in vivo fitness and survival.\n\nImportanceC. jejuni causes millions of gastrointestinal infections annually worldwide. Poultry and poultry products are major sources of C. jejuni infection to human as the microbe is a commensal colonizer of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance in C. jejuni, there is need to identify alternative ways to control this pathogen. Genes encoding the high-affinity phosphate transporter PstSCAB were highly expressed during colonization of C. jejuni in chicken and human. In this study, we address the role this high-affinity phosphate transporter PstSCAB of C. jejuni on chicken colonization and for its general physiology. PstSCAB is required for colonization in chicken, metabolism and survival under different stress responses and during growth on lactate, a potential substrate for growth of C. jejuni in chickens. Our study highlights that PstSCAB may be an effective target to develop mechanisms to control the bacterial burden in both chicken and human.",

    "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections cause 1.6 million deaths annually, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. Mortality rates are as high as 90% due to limited number of efficacious drugs and poor drug availability. The azole class antifungal, fluconazole, is widely available and has multi-species activity but only inhibits fungal cell growth instead of killing fungal cells, necessitating long treatments. To improve fluconazole treatments, we used our novel high-throughput method, the overlap2 method (O2M), to identify drugs that interact with fluconazole, either increasing or decreasing efficacy. Although serendipitous identification of these interactions is rare, O2M allows us to screen molecules five times faster than testing combinations individually and greatly enriches for interactors. We identified 40 molecules that act synergistically (amplify activity) and 19 molecules that act antagonistically (decrease efficacy) when combined with fluconazole. We found that critical frontline beta-lactam antibiotics antagonize fluconazole activity. A promising fluconazole-synergizing anticholinergic drug, dicyclomine, increases fungal cell permeability and inhibits nutrient intake when combined with fluconazole. In vivo, this combination doubled the time-to-endpoint of mice with disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans infections. Thus, our ability to rapidly identify synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions can potentially alter the patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a group of specialized microbial predators that consume nematodes when food sources are limited. Predation is initiated when conserved nematode ascaroside pheromones are sensed, followed by the development of complex trapping devices. To gain insights into the co-evolution of this inter-kingdom predator-prey relationship, we investigated natural populations of nematodes and NTF, that we found to be ubiquitous in soils. Arthrobotrys species were sympatric with various nematode species and behaved as generalist predators. The ability to sense prey amongst wild isolates of A. oligospora varied greatly, as determined by the number of traps after exposure to Caenorhabditis elegans. While some strains were highly sensitive to C. elegans and the nematode pheromone ascarosides, others responded only weakly. Furthermore, strains that were highly sensitive to the nematode prey also developed traps faster. The polymorphic nature of trap formation correlated with competency in prey killing, as well as with the phylogeny of A. oligospora natural strains, calculated after assembly and annotation of the genomes of twenty isolates. A chromosome level genome assembly and annotation was established for one of the most sensitive wild isolate, and deletion of the only G protein {beta} subunit-encoding gene of A. oligospora nearly abolished trap formation, implicating G protein signaling in predation. In summary, our study establishes a highly responsive A. oligospora wild isolate as a novel model strain for the study of fungal-nematode interactions and demonstrates that trap formation is a fitness character in generalist predators of the NTF family.\n\nSignificance statementNematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are carnivorous microbes that hold potential to be used as biological control agents due to their ability to consume nematodes. In this work we show that NTF are ubiquitous generalist predators found in sympatry with their prey in soil samples. Wild isolates of NTF displayed a naturally diverse ability to execute their predatory lifestyle. We generated a large whole genome sequencing dataset for many of the fungal isolates that will serve as the basis of future projects isolates. In particular, we establish TWF154, a highly responsive strain of Arthrobotrys oligospora, as a model strain to study the genetics of NTF. Lastly, we provide evidence that G-protein signaling is necessary for trap induction in NTF.",

    "abstract": "Hypercapnia during breath holding is believed to be the dominant driver behind the modulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Here we showed that the cerebrovascular responses to brief breath hold epochs were coupled not only with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), but also with a decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to evaluate the CBF changes during breath holding by measuring the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral arteries, a pair of cerebral arteries that supply most parts of the brain. The regional CBF changes during breath hold epochs were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes as surrogate of CBF changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Given the interdependence of the dynamic changes between PCO2 and PO2, we found that the breath-by-breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER), namely the ratio of changes in PO2 ({Delta}PO2) to changes in PCO2 ({Delta}PCO2) between end inspiration and end expiration, was superior to either {Delta}PO2 or {Delta}PCO2 alone in coupling with the changes of CBFv and BOLD signals under breath hold challenge. The regional cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) results derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on bER under breath hold challenge resembled those derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) under exogenous CO2 challenge. Our findings provide a novel insight on the potential of using bER to better quantify CVR changes under breath hold challenge, although the physiological mechanisms of cerebrovascular changes underlying breath hold and exogenous CO2 challenges are potentially different.",

    "abstract": "In the statistical analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain data it remains a challenge to account for simultaneously testing activation in over 100.000 volume units or voxels. A popular method that reduces the dimensionality of this test problem is cluster-based inference. We propose a new testing procedure that allows to control the family-wise error (FWE) rate at the cluster level but improves cluster-based test decisions in two ways by (1) taking into account a measure for data analytical stability and (2) allowing a more voxel-based interpretation of the results. For each voxel, we define the re-selection rate conditional on a given FWE-corrected threshold and use this rate, which is a measure of stability, into the selection process. In our procedure, we set a more liberal and a more conservative FWE controlling threshold. Clusters that survive the liberal but not the conservative threshold are retained if sufficient evidence for voxelwise stability is available. Cluster that survive the conservative threshold are retained anyhow, and clusters that do not survive the liberal threshold are not further considered. Using the Human Connectome Project Data (Van Essen et al., 2012), we demonstrate how in a group analysis our method results not only in a higher number of selected voxels but also in a larger overlap between different test images. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability of our procedure to control the FWE, also in relatively small sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Leading-following behavior as a way of transferring information about the location of resources is widespread in different animal societies. However, it cannot always be observed directly. Here, we develop a general method to infer leading-following events from observational data if only the discrete appearance of individuals is recorded. Our method further allows to distinguish such events from local enhancement at the resource, such as swarming behavior in case of bats, which is another widespread way of transferring information among animals. To test our methodology, we analyze longitudinal data about the roosting behavior of Bechsteins bats from two different colonies and different years. The detection of leading-following events allows us, in a second step, to construct social networks in which nodes represent individual bats and directed and weighted links the leading-following events. We analyze the topology of these networks on the level of the colony, to see whether all individuals participate in leading-following behavior. Further, based on the leading-following network we measure the importance of individuals in this leading-following behavior by calculating different centrality measures. We find that individuals can be consistently ranked regarding their influence on others. Moreover, we identify a small set of individuals that play a central role in leading other bats to roosts. Our methodology can be used to understand the leading-following behavior and the individual impact of group members on the spread of information in animal groups in general.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large gene expression datasets has revealed the need for improved tools to identify enriched gene categories and visualize enrichment patterns. While Gene Ontogeny (GO) provides a valuable tool for gene set enrichment analysis, it has several limitations. First, it is difficult to graphically compare multiple GO analyses. Second, genes from some model systems are not well represented. For example, around 30% of Caenorhabditis elegans genes are missing from analysis in commonly used databases. To allow categorization and visualization of enriched C. elegans gene sets in different types of genome-scale data, we developed WormCat, a web-based tool that uses a near-complete annotation of the C. elegans genome to identify co-expressed gene sets and scaled heat map for enrichment visualization. We tested the performance of WormCat using a variety of published transcriptomic datasets and show that it reproduces major categories identified by GO. Importantly, we also found previously unidentified categories that are informative for interpreting phenotypes or predicting biological function. For example, we analyzed published RNA-seq data from C. elegans treated with combinations of lifespan-extending drugs where one combination paradoxically shortened lifespan. Using WormCat, we identified sterol metabolism as a category that was not enriched in the single or double combinations but emerged in a triple combination along with the lifespan shortening. Thus, WormCat identified a gene set with potential phenotypic relevance that was not uncovered with previous GO analysis. In conclusion, WormCat provides a powerful tool for the analysis and visualization of gene set enrichment in different types of C. elegans datasets.",

Those achievements greatly inspire researchers in genomic study and make deep learning in genomics a very hot topic. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are frequently used for genomic sequence prediction problems; multiple layer perception (MLP) and auto-encoders (AE) are frequently used for genomic profiling data like RNA expression data and gene mutation data. Here, we introduce a new neural network architecture, named residual fully-connected neural network (RFCN) and demonstrate its advantage for modeling genomic profiling data. We further incorporate AutoML algorithms and implement AutoGenome, an end-to-end automated genomic deep learning framework. By utilizing the proposed RFCN architectures, automatic hyper-parameter search and neural architecture search algorithms, AutoGenome can train high-performance deep learning models for various kinds of genomic profiling data automatically. To make researchers better understand the trained models, AutoGenome can assess the feature importance and export the most important features for supervised learning tasks, and the representative latent vectors for unsupervised learning tasks.

Here we studied the contribution of respiratory gas exchange (RGE) metrics to CHF during spontaneous breathing. RGE metrics include the breath-by-breath changes of partial pressure of oxygen ({Delta}PO2) and carbon dioxide ({Delta}PCO2) between end inspiration and end expiration, and their ratio breath-by-breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER). We used transcranial Doppler sonography to evaluate CHF changes during spontaneous breathing by measuring the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral arteries. The regional CHF changes during spontaneous breathing were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. We found that prominent oscillations with periods of 0.5 to 2 minutes characterized {Delta}PO2, {Delta}PCO2 and bER. The oscillations of bER were coherent with CHF during spontaneous breathing at the frequency range of 0.008-0.03Hz which is consistent with the low frequency resting state CHF. CHF had strong correlation with bER, followed by {Delta}PO2 and then by {Delta}PCO2. Brain regions with the strongest bER-CHF coupling overlapped with many areas of default mode network. Although the physiological mechanisms underlying the strong correlation between bER and CHF are not completely understood, our findings suggest the contribution of bER to low frequency resting state CHF. It also provides a novel insight of brain-body interaction via CHF and oscillations of RGE metrics.",

    "abstract": "Finding drug targets for antimicrobial treatment is a central focus in biomedical research. To discover new drug targets, we developed a method to identify which nutrients are essential for microorganisms. Using 13C labeled metabolites to infer metabolic fluxes is the most informative way to infer metabolic fluxes to date. However, the data can get difficult to acquire in complicated environments, for example, if the pathogen homes in host cells. Although data from gene expression profiling is less informative compared to metabolic tracer derived data, its generation is less laborious, and may still provide the relevant information. Besides this, metabolic fluxes have been successfully predicted by flux balance analysis (FBA). We developed an FBA based approach using the stoichiometric knowledge of the metabolic reactions of a cell combining them with expression profiles of the coding genes. We aimed to identify essential drug targets for specific nutritional uptakes of microorganisms. As a case study, we predicted each single carbon source out of a pool of eight different carbon sources for B. subtilis based on gene expression profiles. The models were in good agreement to models basing on 13C metabolic flux data of the same conditions. We could well predict every carbon source. Later, we applied successfully the model to unseen data from a study in which the carbon source was shifted from glucose to malate and vice versa. Technically, we present a new and fast method to reduce thermodynamically infeasible loops, which is a necessary preprocessing step for such model-building algorithms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEIdentifying metabolic fluxes using 13C labeled tracers is the most informative way to gain insight into metabolic fluxes. However, obtaining the data can be laborious and challenging in a complex environment. Though transcriptional data is an indirect mean to estimate the fluxes, it can help to identify this. Here, we developed a new method employing constraint-based modeling to predict metabolic fluxes embedding gene expression profiles in a linear regression model. As a case study, we used the data from Bacillus subtilis grown under different carbon sources. We could well predict the correct carbon source.

    "abstract": "2.Over the last 35 years in the UK the burden of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 infection has, during different periods of time, been associated with five different sub-lineages (1983-1995: Ia, I/IIa and I/IIb, 1996-2014: Ic and 2015-2018: IIb). The acquisition of a stx2a-encoding bacteriophage by these five sub-lineages appears to have coincided with their respective emergences. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) was used to sequence, characterise and compare the stx-encoding prophage harboured by each sub-lineage to investigate the integration of this key virulence factor. The stx2a-encoding prophage from each of the lineages causing clinical disease in the UK were all different, including the two UK sub-lineages (Ia and I/IIa) circulating concurrently and causing severe disease in the early 1980s. Comparisons between the stx2a-encoding prophage in sub-lineages I/IIb and IIb revealed similarity to the prophage commonly found to encode stx2c, and the same site of bacteriophage integration (sbcB) as stx2c encoding prophage. These data suggest independent acquisition of previously unobserved stx2a-encoding phage is more likely to have contributed to the emergence of STEC O157:H7 sub-lineages in the UK than intra-UK lineage to lineage phage transmission. In contrast, the stx2c-encoding prophage showed a high level of similarity across lineage and time, consistent with the model of stx2c being present in the common ancestor to extant STEC O157:H7 and maintained by vertical inheritance in the majority of the population. Studying the nature of the stx-encoding bacteriophage contributes to our understanding of the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of STEC O157:H7.\n\n3. Impact statementThe application of ONT technology to sequence UK epidemic strains of STEC O157:H7 revealed stx2a-encoding prophage exhibit a high level of diversity. There was little evidence of geographical or temporal patterns of relatedness, or of intra-UK transmission of stx2a-encoding prophage between indigenous strains. The stx2a-encoding prophage in the UK lineages associated with severe disease appear to be acquired independently and most likely from different geographical and/or environmental sources. These data provide supporting evidence for the existence of a dynamic environmental reservoir of stx2a-encoding prophage that pose a threat public health due to their potential for integration into competent, indigenous sub-lineages of STEC O157:H7. We also provide further evidence that stx2c-encoding prophage exhibit a high level of similarity across lineage, geographical region and time, and have likely been maintained and inherited vertically.\n\n4.

    "abstract": "Catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions, can have profound impacts on the demographic histories of resident taxa. Due to its presumed effect on biodiversity, the Pleistocene eruption of super-volcano Toba has received abundant attention. We test the effects of the Toba eruption on the diversification, genetic diversity, and demography of three co-distributed species of parachuting frogs (Genus Rhacophorus) on Sumatra. We generate target-capture data ([~]950 loci and [~]440,000 bp) for three species of parachuting frogs and use these data paired with previously generated double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq) data to estimate population structure and genetic diversity, to test for population size changes using demographic modelling, and to estimate the temporal clustering of size change events using a full-likelihood Bayesian method. We find that populations around Toba exhibit reduced genetic diversity compared with southern populations, and that northern populations exhibit a shift in effective population size around the time of the eruption ([~]80 kya). However, we infer a stronger signal of expansion in southern populations around [~]400 kya, and at least two of the northern populations may have also expanded at this time. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Toba eruption precipitated population declines in northern populations, but that the demographic history of these three species was also strongly impacted by mid-Pleistocene forest expansion during glacial periods. We propose local rather than regional effects of the Toba eruption, and emphasize the dynamic nature of diversification on the Sunda Shelf.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRecent developments in technology have enabled researchers to collect multiple OMICS datasets for the same individuals. The conventional approach for understanding the relationships between the collected datasets and the complex trait of interest would be through the analysis of each OMIC dataset separately from the rest, or to test for associations between the OMICS datasets. In this work we show that by integrating multiple OMICS datasets together, instead of analysing them separately, improves our understanding of their in-between relationships as well as the predictive accuracy for the tested trait. As OMICS datasets are heterogeneous and high-dimensional (p >> n) integrating them can be done through Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) that penalises the canonical variables for producing sparse latent variables while achieving maximal correlation between the datasets. Over the last years, a number of approaches for implementing sCCA have been proposed, where they differ on their objective functions, iterative algorithm for obtaining the sparse latent variables and make different assumptions about the original datasets.\n\nResultsThrough a comparative study we have explored the performance of the conventional CCA proposed by Parkhomenko et al. [2009], penalised matrix decomposition CCA proposed by Witten and Tibshirani [2009] and its extension proposed by Suo et al. [2017]. The aferomentioned methods were modified to allow for different penalty functions. Although sCCA is an unsupervised learning approach for understanding of the in-between relationships, we have twisted the problem as a supervised learning one and investigated how the computed latent variables can be used for predicting complex traits. The approaches were extended to allow for multiple (more than two) datasets where the trait was included as one of the input datasets. Both ways have shown improvement over conventional predictive models that include one or multiple datasets.\n\nContacttr1915@ic.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of the autophagy protein, Beclin1, in the replication and disease of Zika virus (ZIKV) in pregnant dams and their offspring using Beclin1-deficient (Atg6+/-) and wild-type (Atg6+/+) mouse model infected with the Honduran (R103451), Puerto Rican (PRVABC59), and the Uganda (MR766) strains of ZIKV. Pregnant dams infected subcutaneously at embryonic stage (E)9 showed viral RNA in serum harvested at E13 and in various organs removed postmortem at E17. Subcutaneous infections with ZIKV also showed the vertical transmission of ZIKV from the placenta to embryos removed postmortem at E17. From the three isolates, R103451-infected Atg6+/- dams had the lowest mortality rate while 30 % of their offspring containing the hemizygous beclin1 allele (Atg6+/-) were smaller in size and had smaller and underdeveloped brain. Growth impairment in the pups became noticeable after two weeks post-birth. After 21-days, pups were sacrificed and brain tissues removed postmortem showed expression of the envelope (E) and the non-structural (NS)-1 proteins, along with signs of neuronal injury, despite an absence in viral RNA detection. A significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) by 8-fold and a decrease in the mRNA expression levels of several microcephaly related genes along with an increase in the secretion of several inflammatory molecules may have contributed to the observed phenotype. Since autophagy regulates cytokines and chemokines production, a dysregulation in this pathway may have further exacerbated the pathology of ZIKV.\n\nIMPORTANCEPups delivered from ZIKV-infected dams showed significant growth impairments in the body and the brain. We believe that the reduction in insulin growth factor together with the increase secretion of inflammatory molecules may have triggered neuronal injury and the downregulation of the microcephalic genes, while reduced expression of the autophagy protein, Beclin1 further exacerbated the pathology. Although the mechanism is still unknown, the autophagy pathway seems to play a key role in ZIKV pathology. It is therefore of great significance to study the role of autophagy during viral infection with the goal to identify potential targets for anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we demonstrate that these interactions can be accounted for by \"translation bottlenecks\": points in the translation cycle where antibiotics block ribosomal progression. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions between translation inhibitors, we generated translation bottlenecks genetically using inducible control of translation factors that regulate well-defined translation cycle steps. These perturbations accurately mimicked antibiotic action and their interactions, supporting that the interplay of different translation bottlenecks causes these interactions. We further showed that the kinetics of drug uptake and binding together with growth laws allows direct prediction of a large fraction of observed interactions, yet fails for suppression. Simultaneously varying two translation bottlenecks in the same cell revealed how the dense traffic of ribosomes and competition for translation factors results in previously unexplained suppression.

    "abstract": "Changes of Mind are a striking example of the human ability to flexibly reverse decisions after commitment to an initial choice, and to change actions according to circumstances. Previous studies of Changes of Mind largely focused on perceptual choices. Here we investigate reversals of voluntary, endogenous action decisions. In a novel version of the random-dot motion task, participants moved to a target that matched both the perceived dot-motion direction and an internally-generated intention (which colour target to move to). Movement trajectories revealed whether and when participants 1) perceived a change in dot-motion direction, or additionally 2) changed the colour that they chose to move to ( Change of Intention). Changes of Intention were less frequent in participants with strong colour intentions, as indicated by high performance costs in trials where perceptual information conflicted with the endogenous intention (Exp. 1). Additionally, Changes of Intention were more frequent when motor costs of intention pursuit were high (Exp. 2). These findings were simulated using an attractor network model that continuously integrates voluntary intentions, sensory evidence, and motor costs. This argues in favour of a unifying framework for dynamic decision-making processes, in which voluntary actions emerge from a dynamic combination of internal action tendencies and external environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "The current study determined if inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus impairs the retrieval of newly formed context fear memories. This region was silencing by activating inhibitory neurons or by hyperpolarizing pyramidal cells directly. When inhibitory neurons were stimulated with ChR2, memory retrieval was significantly impaired. In contrast, when the same neurons were activated with the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq, retrieval was not affected. This dissociation was not due to differences in inhibition, as both manipulations activated interneurons and reduced excitation throughout the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, we hypothesize that the retrieval deficit caused by ChR2 stimulation is due to an immediate reduction in hippocampal activity that does not provide enough time for other brain regions to compensate. Stimulation of DREADDs, on the other hand, produces a gradual loss of excitation that takes several minutes to reach asymptote. This appears to be a sufficient amount of time for extra-hippocampal structures to become engaged and express context fear. Implications for theories of hippocampal function, systems consolidation and memory retrieval are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The crustacean Talitrus saltator is known to use many celestial cues during its orientation along the sea-land axis of sandy shores. In this paper, we investigated the existence of the eye regionalization by morphological, electrophysiological and behavioural experiments. Each ommatidium possesses five radially arranged retinular cells producing a square fused rhabdom by R1-R4 cells; the smaller R5 exist between R1 and R4. The size of R5 rhabdomere is largest in dorsal part and becomes gradually smaller in median and ventral part of the eye. Spectral-sensitivity measurements were recorded from either dorsal or ventral parts of the compound eye to clarify the chromatic difference. Results show that the dorsal part is green and UV-blue dichromatic, whereas the ventral part is UV (390 nm) with a substantial population of 450 nm receptors with the responses in the longer wavelength region. To evaluate the orienting behaviour of individuals, their eyes were black painted either in the dorsal or ventral part, under natural sky or a blue filter with or without the vision of the sun. Results show that animals painted on the dorsal part of their eyes tested under the screened sun were more dispersed and in certain cases their directions deflected than other groups of individuals. Furthermore, sandhoppers subjected to the obscuring of this area met in any case high difficulties in their directional choices. Therefore, our present work indicates the existence of a regionalization of the compound eye of T. saltator.\n\nSummary statementThis work provides evidences of the morphological and electrophysiological regionalization of the compound eye and the visual capabilities for behaviour involved in the recognition of the celestial compass orienting factors in crustaceans.",

    "abstract": "Cancer incidence increases exponentially with age, when human telomeres are shorter. Similarly, telomerase mutant zebrafish (tert) have premature short telomeres and anticipate cancer incidence to younger ages. However, because short telomeres constitute a road block to cell proliferation, telomere shortening is currently viewed as a tumor suppressor mechanism and should protect from cancer. This conundrum is not fully understood. In our current study, we report that telomere shortening promotes cancer in a non-cell autonomous manner. Using zebrafish chimeras, we show increased incidence of invasive melanoma when WT tumors are generated in tert mutant zebrafish. tert zebrafish show increased levels of senescence (cdkn2a and ink4a/b) and inflammation (TNF-). In addition, we transferred second generation tert blastula cells into WT to produce embryo chimeras. Cells with very short telomeres induced senescence and increased neutrophil numbers in surrounding larval tissues in a non-cell autonomous manner, creating an inflammatory environment. Considering that inflammation is pro-tumorigenic, we transplanted melanoma-derived cells into second generation tert zebrafish embryos and observed that tissue environment with short telomeres leads to increased micrometastasis. To test if inflammation was necessary for this effect, we treated melanoma transplants with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and show that higher melanoma invasiveness can be averted. Thus, apart from the cell autonomous role of short telomeres in contributing to genome instability, we propose that telomere shortening with age causes systemic chronic inflammation leading to increased tumor incidence.\n\nSignificance StatementCancer incidence increases exponentially in human midlife. Even though mutation accumulation in somatic tissues results in increased tumorigenesis, it is currently not understood how aging contributes to cancer. Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, shorten with each cell division. Here we show that telomere shortening contributes to cancer in a non-cell autonomous manner. Using embryo chimeras of telomerase deficient zebrafish generated from melanoma-prone fish, we show that tumors arise more frequently and become more invasive in animals with shorter telomeres. Telomere shortening gives rise to increased senescence and systemic inflammation. We observed increased melanoma metastasis dissemination in zebrafish larvae with very short telomeres. Thus, telomere shortening similar to human aging, generates a chronic inflammatory environment that increases cancer incidence.",

The transfer of bacteriophages between more distant clades of bacteria has often been postulated, but remains mostly unaddressed. In this work we leverage the sequencing of a novel cluster of phages infecting Streptomyces bacteria and the availability of large numbers of complete phage genomes in public repositories to address this question. Using phylogenetic and comparative genomics methods, we show that several clusters of Actinobacteria-infecting phages are more closely related between them, and with a small group of Firmicutes phages, than with any other actinobacteriophage lineage. These data indicate that this heterogeneous group of phages shares a common ancestor with well-defined genome structure. Analysis of genomic %GC content and codon usage bias shows that these actinobacteriophages are poorly adapted to their Actinobacteria hosts, suggesting that this phage lineage could have originated in an ancestor of the Firmicutes, adapted to the low %GC content members of this phylum, and later migrated to the Actinobacteria, or that selective pressure for enhanced translational throughput is significantly lower for phages infecting Actinobacteria hosts.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, has increased dramatically in recent decades. The release of Aedes aegypti carrying the maternally inherited symbiont Wolbachia as an intervention to control arboviruses is being trialled in several countries. However, these efforts are compromised in many endemic regions due to the co-localization of the secondary vector Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Ae. albopictus has an expanding global distribution following incursions into a number of new territories. To date, only the wMel and wPip strains of Wolbachia have been reported to be transferred into and characterized in this vector. A Wolbachia strain naturally infecting Drosophila simulans, wAu, was selected for transfer into a Malaysian Ae. albopictus line to create a novel triple-strain infection. The newly generated line showed self-compatibility, moderate fitness cost and complete resistance to Zika and dengue infections.\n\nAuthor summaryAedes albopictus, the invasive Asian tiger mosquito, is responsible for numerous outbreaks of important viruses such as dengue and Zika in various regions of the world. The need for alterative control interventions propelled the development of a novel approach that exploits a natural insect symbiont, Wolbachia; when transferred into non-native hosts, these maternally-inherited bacteria are able to interfere with the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses, and also provide reproductive advantages to the host, offering a promising tool for self-sustaining field applications. Currently, several field trials are ongoing for the primary vector of dengue and several other arboviruses, Aedes aegypti, providing encouraging results. In this study, Ae. albopictus has been targeted for a similar approach: this mosquito species naturally carries two strains of Wolbachia. The artificial introduction of a third, non-native strain made this line less able to transmit dengue and Zika viruses and had an impact on its fitness.",

    "abstract": "1.We previously have reported that neonatal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination improves neurogenesis and behavior in early life through affecting the neuroimmune milieu in the brain, but it is uncertain whether activation phenotypes and functional changes in T lymphocytes shape brain development. Here, we studied the effects of BCG vaccination via the adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes from the BALB/c wild-type mice into naive mice. Our results show that mice adoptive BCG-induced lymphocytes (BCG->naive mice) showed anxiolytic and antidepressant-like performance when completing an elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Meanwhile, BCG->naive mice possess more cell proliferation and newborn neurons than PBS->naive and nude mice in the hippocampus. IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 levels in the serum of BCG->naive mice also increased, while TNF- and IL-1{beta} levels were reduced relative to those of PBS->naive and nude mice. We further found that BCG->naive mice showed different repartition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell to naive (CD62L+ CD44low), effector memory (CD62L- CD44hi), central memory (CD62L+ CD44hi) and acute/activated effector (CD62L- CD44low) cells in the spleen. Importantly, the adoptive transfer of BCG-induced T lymphocytes infiltrated into the dura mater and brain parenchyma of the nude mice. Activation phenotypes and functional changes in T lymphocytes are very likely to affect the neuroimmune milieu in the brain, and alterations in ratios of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells may affect the expression of correlative cytokines in the serum, accounting for our behavioral results. We conclude thus that the adoptive transfer of BCG-induced T lymphocytes contributes to hippocampal cell proliferation and tempers anxiety-like behavior in immune deficient mice. Our work shows that BCG vaccination improves hippocampal cell proliferation outcomes and behaviors, likely as a result of splenic effector/memory T lymphocytes regulating the neuroimmune niche in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells develop tactics to circumvent the interventions by desensitizing themselves to interventions. The principle routes of desensitization include a) activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and b) downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95/CD95L). As a result, it requires high therapeutic dose to achieve tumor regression which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral damaging effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs) in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing CSCs and cancer resistant cells (CRCs) which are shown to be responsible for high recurrence of disease and low patient survival. Here, we report several novel tumor targeted sensitizers derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001-003). The drug design is based on a novel concept \"A priori activation of apoptosis pathways of tumor technology (AAAPT) which is designed to activate specific cell death pathways and inhibit survival pathways simultaneously. Our results indicate that AMP-001-003 sensitize various types of cancer cells including MDA-MB-231 (triple negative breast cancer), PC3 (prostate cancer) and A543 (ling cancer) cells resulting in reducing the IC-50 of doxorubicin in vitro. At higher dose, AMP-001 acts as an anti-tumor agent on its own. The synergy between AMP-001 and doxorubicin could pave a new pathway to use AMP-001 as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy to achieve a better efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity by the current treatments.\n\nSummary StatementA Priori Activation of Apoptosis Pathways of Tumor often referred to as \"AAAPT\" is a novel targeted tumor sensitizing technology which synergizes with chemotherapy to enhance the treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Deer overabundance is a contributing factor in the degradation of plant communities and ecosystems worldwide. The management and conservation of the deer-affected ecosystems requires us to urgently grasp deer population trends and to identify the factors that affect them. In this study, we developed a Bayesian state-space model to estimate the population dynamics of sika deer (Cervus nippon) in a cool-temperate forest in Japan, where wolves (Canis lupus hodophilax) are extinct. The model was based on field data collected from block count surveys, road count surveys by vehicles, mortality surveys during the winter, and nuisance control for 12 years (2007-2018). We clarified the seasonal and annual fluctuation of the deer population. We found two peaks of deer abundance (2007 and 2010) over 12 years. In 2011 the estimated deer abundance decreased drastically and has remained at a low level then. The deer population increased from spring to autumn and decreased from autumn to winter in most years. The seasonal fluctuation we detected could reflect the seasonal migration pattern of deer and the population recruitment through fawn births in early summer. In our model, snowfall accumulation, which can be a lethal factor for deer, may have slightly affected their mortality during the winter. Although we could not detect a direct effect of snow on population dynamics, snowfall decrease due to global warming may decelerate the winter migration of deer; subsequently, deer staying on-site may intensively forage evergreen perennial plants during the winter season. The nuisance control affected population dynamics. Even in wildlife protection areas and national parks where hunting is regulated, nuisance control could be effective in buffering the effect of deer browsing on forest ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Occasionally during protein synthesis, the ribosome bypasses the stop codon and continues translation to the next stop codon in frame. This error is called translational readthrough (TR). Earlier research suggest that TR is a relatively common error, in several taxa, yet the evolutionary relevance of this translational error is still unclear. By analysing ribosome profiling data, we have conducted species comparisons between yeasts to infer conservation of TR between orthologs. Moreover, we infer the evolutionary rate of error prone and canonically translated proteins to deduct differential selective pressure. We find that about 40% of error prone proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe do not have any orthologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but that 60% of error prone proteins in S. pombe are undergoing canonical translation in S. cerevisiae. Error prone proteins tend to have a higher GC-content in the 3-UTR, unlike their canonically translated ortholog. We do not find the same trends for GC-content of the CDS. We discuss the role of 3-UTR and GC-content regarding translational readthrough. Moreover, we find that there is neither selective pressure against or for TR. We suggest that TR is a near-neutral error that goes unseen by natural selection. We speculate that TR yield neutral protein isoforms that are not being purged. We suggest that isoforms, yielded by TR, increase proteomic diversity in the cell, which is readily available upon sudden environmental shifts and which therefore may become adaptive.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere is an evolutionary balance act between adaptation and selection against change. Any system needs to be able to adapt facing novel environmental conditions. Simultaneously, biological systems are under selection to maintain fitness and thus undergo selection against mutations. Phenotypic mutations - translational errors during protein synthesis - have been suggested to play a role in protein evolvability by enabling quick assessment of viable phenotypes and thus enable quick adaptation. Here we test this hypothesis, by inferring evolutionary rate of proteins prone to a specific case of phenotypic mutations: translational readthrough (TR). By making use of publicly available data of yeasts, we find that TR goes unseen by natural selection and appear as a neutral event. We suggest that TR goes unseen by selection and occurs as \"permissive wallflowers\", which may become relevant and yield adaptive benefits. This work highlights that stochastic processes are not necessarily under stringent selection but may prevail. In conclusion, we suggest that TR is a neutral non-adaptive process that can yield adaptive benefits.",

    "abstract": "The potential of probiotics to manipulate the intestinal microbial ecosystem toward commensal bacteria growth offers great hope for enhancing health and performance in poultry. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of five probiotic-based formulations in modulating cecal microbiota in broilers at 21 and 42 days of age. Probiotics investigated included a synbiotic (SYNBIO), a yeast-based probiotic (YEAST), and three single-strain formulations of spore-forming Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (SINGLE1), B. subtilis (SINGLE2) and B. licheniformis (SINGLE3). Metagenomics analyses showed that the cecal microbiota of SINGLE, YEAST, and MULTI supplemented birds had low diversity compared to the control diet without probiotics (CON) at 21d. At the same age, birds fed SYNBIO had a high population of Lactobacillus salivarus and Lachnospiraceae, which was reflected in a singular microbial community illustrated by beta-diversity analyses. By 42d, there were no differences in alpha or beta-diversity in the microbiota of probiotic-treated broilers compared to CON. Birds treated with SINGLE2 had a lower abundance of lactic acid bacteria, while a higher (p<0.05) population of unidentified Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Although the investigated probiotic formulations shared similar taxonomy, modulation of microbiota was not a core outcome for all probiotic-treated broilers indicating the success of microbiota-based intervention may ultimately be dependent on probiotic mixture and broilers age.",

    "abstract": "Black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.) larvae can convert fresh pig manure into protein and fat-rich biomass, which can then be used as livestock feed. Currently, it is the only insect approved for such purposes in Europe, Canada, and the USA. Pig manure is rich in zoonotic pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp.). BSF larvae inhibit these zoonotic pathogens; however, the mechanism is unclear. We employed RNAi, qRT-PCR, and Illumina MiSeq bacterial 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing molecular techniques to study the interaction between the two immune genes (Duoxin Duox-reactive oxygen species [ROS] immune system and TLR3 in the Toll signaling pathway) and zoonotic pathogens to determine the mechanisms resulting in pathogen suppression.\n\nResults indicated that Bsf Duox-TLR3 RNAi increased bacterial load but decreased the relative abundance of Providenciaand Dysgonomonasintestinal symbionts. Concurrently, Bsf Duox-TLR3 RNAi inactivated the NF-{kappa} B signaling pathway, downregulated the expression of antimicrobial peptides, and diminished inhibitory effects on zoonotic pathogen. The resulting dysbiosis stimulated an immune response by activating BsfDuox and promoting ROS, which regulated the composition and structure of the gut bacterial community.\n\nThus, BsfDuox and BsfTLR3 are important factors in regulating the gut key bacteria Providenciaand Dysgonomonas homeostasis while inhibiting target zoonotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited neuromuscular disease which results from an expansion of repetitive DNA elements within the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Some patients develop multiple pilomatricomas as well as malignant tumors in other tissues. Mutations of the catenin-{beta} gene (CTNNB1) could be demonstrated in most non-syndromic pilomatricomas.\n\nIn order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms which might be responsible for the occurrence of multiple pilomatricomas and cancers in patients with DM1, we have sequenced the CTNNB1 gene of four pilomatricomas and of one pilomatrical carcinoma which developed in one patient with molecularly proven DM1 within 4 years. We further analyzed the pilomatrical tumors for microsatellite instability as well as by NGS for mutations in 161 cancer-associated genes.\n\nSomatic and independent point-mutations were detected at typical hotspot regions of CTNNB1 (S33C, S33F, G34V, T41I) while one mutation within CTNNB1 represented a duplication mutation (G34dup.). Pilomatricoma samples were analyzed for microsatellite instability and expression of mismatch repair proteins but no mutated microsatellites could be detected and expression of mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 was not perturbed. NGS analysis only revealed one heterozygous germline mutation c.8494C>T; p.(Arg2832Cys) within the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) which remained heterozygous in the pilomatrical tumors.\n\nThe detection of different somatic mutations in different pilomatricomas and in the pilomatrical carcinoma as well as the observation that the patient developed multiple pilomatricomas and one pilomatrical carcinoma over a short time period strongly suggest that the patient displays a hypermutation phenotype. This hypermutability seems to be tissue and gene restricted. Co-translation of the mutated DMPK gene and the CTNNB1 gene in cycling hair follicles might constitute an explanation for the observed tissue and gene specificity of hypermutability observed in DM1 patients. Elucidation of putative mechanisms responsible for hypermutability in DM1 patients requires further research.\n\nAuthor summaryLess than 10% of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), an inherited and the most common neuromuscular disorder, develop pilomatricomas, often as multiple tumors. Pilomatricomas are benign skin tumors deriving from hair matrix cells, and they are very rare in the general population. Recently it could be demonstrated that DM1 patients also harbour and enhanced risk for benign and malignant tumors in various other tissues.\n\nDM1 is characterized genetically by an expansion of trinucleotide repeats within the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK gene (DM1 protein kinase). It could be demonstrated that these expanded CTG-repeats are transcribed into RNA and that this non-translated repetitive RNA forms aggregates with various splicing regulators, which in turn impair transcription of multiple genes in various tissues. Following the gain-of-function-RNA hypothesis, Mueller and colleagues suggested in 2009 that the untranslated repetitive RNA directly enhances expression of {beta}-catenin resulting in pilomatricomas as well as in various cancers which rely on activation of the WNT/APC/{beta}-catenin pathway.\n\nIn order to prove or to reject this hypothesis we have sequenced the CTNNB1 gene of four pilomatricomas and of one pilomatrical carcinoma which developed in one patient with molecularly proven DM1 within 4 years. Somatic and independent point-mutations were detected at typical hotspot regions of CTNNB1 (S33C, S33F, G34V, T41I) while one mutation within CTNNB1 represented a duplication mutation (G34dup.). We further analyzed the pilomatrical tumors for microsatellite instability but no mutated microsatellites could be detected and expression of mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 was not perturbed.

In contrast, our results strongly suggest that the patient displays a tissue and gene restricted hypermutation phenotype. One putative mechanism for the assumed gene and tissue restriction could be co-translation of the mutated DMPK gene and the CTNNB1 gene in cycling hair follicles.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV) is a ubiquitous human virus resident in a majority of the global population as a latent infection. Acyclovir (ACV), is the standard of care drug used to treat primary and recurrent infections, supplemented in some patients with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment to suppress deleterious inflammatory responses. We found that HSV, ACV and IVIG can all independently disrupt the gut bacterial community in a sex biased manner when given to uninfected mice. Treatment of HSV infected mice with ACV or IVIG alone or together revealed complex interactions between these drugs and infection that caused pronounced sex biased dysbiosis. ACV reduced Bacteroidetes levels in male but not female mice, while levels of the Anti-inflammatory Clostridia (AIC) were reduced in female but not male mice, which is significant as these taxa are associated with protection against the development of GVHD in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Gut barrier dysfunction is associated with GVHD in HSCT patients and ACV also decreased Akkermansia muciniphila, which is important for maintaining gut barrier functionality. Cumulatively, our data suggest that long-term prophylactic ACV treatment of HSCT patients may contribute to GVHD and potentially impact immune reconstitution. These data have important implications for other clinical settings, including HSV eye disease and genital infections, where ACV is given long-term.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrimary and reactivated HSV and VZV infections are treated with Acyclovir (ACV), an antiviral drug that blocks viral DNA synthesis. In some patients IVIG is used as adjunctive therapy to block deleterious inflammation. Long term preventative treatment of patients who receive stem transplants for various blood cancers has been successful in preventing life threatening reactivated HSV and VZV infections, but GVHD remains a major factor limiting transplant success. Studies reported here reveal that HSV infection, ACV and IVIG given alone can all disrupt the gut microbiota and that complex interactions between these drugs and infection results in even more pronounced sex biased changes in the gut bacteria community structure. Importantly, ACV treatment decreased the levels of specific bacterial taxa, including the anti-inflammatory Clostriodia and Bacteroidetes that have been shown to protect against development of GVHD in stem cell transplant patients. These data suggest that long term preventative treatment of patients with ACV may contribute to GVHD in transplant patients and have negative consequences in other HSV induced diseases treated long term with ACV. The health effects of long term ACV and IVIG treatments warrant further clinical studies.",
