    "abstract": "Plant innate immunity relies on NLR receptors that recognize pathogen derived molecules and activate downstream signalling pathways. We analyzed the variation in copy number of NLR genes across flowering plants, and identified a number of species with a low number of NLRs relative to sister species. Two distinct lineages, one monocot (Lentibulariaceae) and one dicot (Alismatales) encapsulate four species with particularly few NLR genes. In these lineages, loss of NLRs coincided with loss of the well-known downstream immune signalling complex (EDS1-PAD4). When we expanded our analysis across the whole proteomes, we were able to identify other characterized immune genes absent only in Lentibulariaceae and Alismatales. Additionally, we identified a small subset of genes with unknown function convergently lost in all four species. We predicted that some of these genes may have a role in plant immunity. Gene expression analyses confirmed that a group of these genes was differentially expressed under pathogen infection. Another subset of these genes was differentially expressed upon drought providing further evidence of a link between the drought and plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) has phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous characteristics. A simulation study demonstrated that attempts to categorize patients with a complex disease into more homogeneous subgroups could have more power to elucidate hidden heritability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted cluster analyses using the k-means algorithm with a cluster number of 15 based on phenotypic variables from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). As a preliminary study, we conducted a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a dataset of 597 ASD cases and 370 controls. In the second step, we divided cases based on the clustering results and conducted GWAS in each of the subgroups vs controls (cluster-based GWAS). We also conducted cluster-based GWAS on another SSC dataset of 712 probands and 354 controls in the replication stage.\n\nResultsIn the preliminary study, we observed no significant associations. In the second step of cluster-based GWASs, we identified 65 chromosomal loci, which included 30 intragenic loci located in 21 genes and 35 intergenic loci that satisfied the threshold of P<5.0x10-8. Some of these loci were located within or near previously reported candidate genes for ASD: CDH5, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, DNAH17, DPP10, DSCAM, FOXK1, GABBR2, GRIN2A5, ITPR1, NTM, SDK1, SNCA and SRRM4. Of these 65 significant chromosomal loci, rs11064685 located within the SRRM4 gene had a significantly different distribution in the cases vs. controls in the replication cohort.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that clustering may successfully identify subgroups with relatively homogeneous disease etiologies. Further cluster validation and replication studies are warranted in larger cohorts.",

    "abstract": "The identity of the etiologic agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), remains unknown. While much attention has been given to the hypothesis that the TSEs may be caused by a proteinaceous infectious agent or  prion, there is considerable evidence to suggest that this hypothesis is incomplete. We have pursued an alternative contention: that the etiologic agent comprises in part a modified and replicating form of an endogenous nucleic acid, probably RNA. The  endovirus hypothesis contends that the parental molecule is most likely to be a small and highly-structured cellular RNA that can convert to a replicating molecule by a finite number of nucleotide sequence changes. We have begun a systematic analysis of candidate molecular species present in hamster brain infected with scrapie strain 263K. Initial work focussed on the 7S group of small RNAs. Examination of 7-2, 7SK and 7SL failed to reveal differences in abundance and/or sequence between normal and scrapie (263K)-infected hamster brain. Inspection of other possible candidates, including U3, H1/8-2 and novel molecules KR1, nu1 and nu2, similarly failed to provide evidence for scrapie-specific molecular variants; alterations to the KR1 sequence failed to correlate with disease. We present sequences of hamster RNAs 7-2, 7SK, 7SL, H1/8-2, U3, nu1, nu2 and KR1. Together our data so far fail to contradict or confirm the hypothesis, while arguing that the major species of these 8 RNA molecules are unlikely to correspond to the etiologic agent of the TSEs.",

    "abstract": "Changing sleep rhythms in adolescents often lead to sleep deficits and increased variability in sleep schedules. The adolescent brain, and in particular the rapidly developing structures involved in emotional control, are vulnerable to external and internal factors. In our previous study in adolescents at age 14, we observed a strong relationship between weekend sleep schedules and regional medial prefrontal cortex grey matter volumes. Here, we aimed to assess whether this relationship remained in this group of adolescents of the general population at the age of 16 (n=101; mean age 16.8 years; 55% girls). We further examined grey matter volumes in the hippocampi and the amygdalae, calculated with voxel-based morphometry. In addition, we investigated the relationship between regional grey matter volumes with psychological functioning. Sleep was assessed with self-reports and psychological functioning with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and tests on working memory and impulsivity. Later weekend wake-up times were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdalae, and greater weekend delays in wake-up time were associated with smaller grey matter volumes in the right hippocampus and amygdala. The medial prefrontal cortex region mediated the correlation between weekend wake up time and both externalising and internalising symptoms. Paying attention to regular sleep habits during adolescence could act as a protective factor against the emergence of psychopathology via enabling favourable brain development.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA repeats that must remain silenced to ensure cell integrity. Several epigenetic pathways including DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in the silencing of TEs, and in the regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the TE-derived plant mobile domain (PMD) proteins have been involved in TE silencing, genome stability, and control of developmental processes. Using a forward genetic screen, we found that the PMD protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) acts synergistically and redundantly with DNA methylation to silence TEs. We found that MAIN and its close homolog MAIN-LIKE 1 (MAIL1) interact together, as well as with the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) PP7-like (PP7L). Remarkably, main, mail1, pp7l single and mail1 pp7l double mutants display similar developmental phenotypes, and share common subsets of upregulated TEs and misregulated genes. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of PMD and PP7-type PPP domains among the Eudicot lineage suggest neo-association processes between the two protein domains to potentially generate new protein function. We propose that, through this interaction, the PMD and PPP domains may constitute a functional protein module required for the proper expression of a common set of genes, and for silencing of TEs.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe plant mobile domain (PMD) is a protein domain of unknown function that is widely spread in the angiosperm plants. Although most PMDs are associated with repeated DNA sequences called transposable elements (TEs), plants have domesticated the PMD to produce genic versions that play important roles within the cell. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) and MAIN-LIKE 1 (MAIL1) are genic PMDs that are involved in genome stability, developmental processes, and silencing of TEs. The mechanisms involving MAIN and MAIL1 in these cellular processes remain elusive. Here, we show that MAIN, MAIL1 and the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) named PP7-like (PP7L) interact to form a protein complex that is required for the proper expression of genes, and the silencing of TEs. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that PMD and PP7-type PPP domains are evolutionary connected, and several plant species express proteins carrying both PMD and PPP domains. We propose that interaction of PMD and PPP domains would create a functional protein module involved in mechanisms regulating gene expression and repressing TEs.",

    "abstract": "The formation of functional cortical maps in the cerebral cortex results from a timely regulated interaction between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and electrical activity. To understand how transcriptional regulation influences network activity and neuronal excitability within the neocortex, we used mice deficient for the area mapping gene Nr2f1 (also known as COUP-TFI), a key determinant of somatosensory area specification during development. We found that cortical loss of Nr2f1 impacts on spontaneous network activity and synchronization at perinatal stages. In addition, we observed alterations in the intrinsic excitability and morphological features of layer V pyramidal neurons. Accordingly, we identified distinct voltage-gated ion channels regulated by Nr2f1 that might directly influence intrinsic bioelectrical properties during critical time windows of somatosensory cortex specification. Together, our data suggest a tight link between Nr2f1 and neuronal excitability in the developmental sequence that ultimately sculpts the emergence of cortical network activity within the immature neocortex.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of biochemical reaction networks are central to the study of dynamic cellular processes and hypothesis generation that informs experimentation and validation. Unfortunately, model parameters are often not available and sparse experimental data leads to challenges in model calibration and parameter estimation. This can in turn lead to unreliable mechanistic interpretations of experimental data and the generation of poorly conceived hypotheses for experimental validation. To address this challenge, we evaluate whether a Bayesian-inspired probability-based approach, that incorporates available information regarding reaction network topology and parameters, can be used to qualitatively explore hypothetical biochemical network execution mechanisms in the context of limited available data. We test our approach on a model of extrinsic apoptosis execution to identify preferred signal execution modes across varying conditions. Apoptosis signal processing can take place either through a mitochondria independent (Type I) mode or a mitochondria dependent (Type II) mode. We first show that in silico knockouts, represented by model subnetworks, successfully identify the most likely execution mode for specific concentrations of key molecular regulators. We then show that changes in molecular regulator concentrations alter the overall reaction flux through the network by shifting the primary route of signal flow between the direct caspase and mitochondrial pathways. Our work thus demonstrates that probabilistic approaches can be used to explore the qualitative dynamic behavior of model biochemical systems even with missing or sparse data.",

Metabolic rate is a key trait that is likely to influence the ability to cope with climate change. Yet, empirical and theoretical work on metabolic rate responses to temperature changes has so far produced mixed results and conflicting predictions.\nC_LIO_LIOur study addresses this issue using a novel approach of comparing fish populations in geothermally warmed lakes and adjacent ambient-temperature lakes in Iceland. This unique  natural experiment provides repeated and independent examples of populations experiencing contrasting thermal environments for many generations over a small geographic scale, thereby avoiding the confounding factors associated with latitudinal or elevational comparisons. Using Icelandic sticklebacks from three warm and three cold habitats, we measured individual metabolic rates across a range of acclimation temperatures to obtain reaction norms for each population.\nC_LIO_LIWe found a general pattern for a lower standard metabolic rate in sticklebacks from warm habitats when measured at a common temperature, as predicted by Kroghs rule. Metabolic rate differences between warm- and cold-habitat sticklebacks were more pronounced at more extreme acclimation temperatures, suggesting the release of cryptic genetic variation upon exposure to novel conditions, which can reveal hidden evolutionary potential. We also found a stronger divergence in metabolic rate between thermal habitats in allopatry than sympatry, indicating that gene flow may constrain physiological adaptation when dispersal between warm and cold habitats is possible.\nC_LIO_LIIn sum, our study suggests that fish may diverge toward a lower standard metabolic rate in a warming world, but this might depend on connectivity and gene flow between different thermal habitats.\nC_LI",

The predictability of antibody-antigen binding is a prerequisite for de novo antibody and (neo-)epitope design. A fundamental premise for the predictability of antibody-antigen binding is the existence of paratope-epitope interaction motifs that are universally shared among antibody-antigen structures. In the largest set of non-redundant antibody-antigen structures, we identified structural interaction motifs, which together compose a commonly shared structure-based vocabulary of paratope-epitope interactions. We show that this vocabulary enables the machine learnability of antibody-antigen binding on the paratope-epitope level using generative machine learning. The vocabulary (i) is compact, less than 104 motifs, (ii) distinct from non-immune protein-protein interactions, and (iii) mediates specific oligo- and polyreactive interactions between paratope-epitope pairs. Our work successfully leveraged combined structure- and sequence-based learning showing that machine-learning-driven predictive paratope and epitope engineering is feasible.",

The theoretical basis of the method is identical to that of maximum-likelihood density modification, previously used to improve maps from macromolecular X-ray crystallography. Two key differences from applications in crystallography are that the errors in Fourier coefficients are largely in the phases in crystallography but in both phases and amplitudes in electron cryo-microscopy, and that half-maps with independent errors are available in electron cryo-microscopy. These differences lead to a distinct approach for combination of information from starting maps with information obtained in the density modification process. The applicability of density modification theory to electron cryo-microscopy was evaluated using half-maps for apoferritin at a resolution of 3.1 [A] and a matched 1.8 [A] reference map. Error estimates for the map obtained by density modification were found to closely agree with true errors as estimated by comparison with the reference map. The density modification procedure was applied to a set of 104 datasets where half-maps, a full map and a model all had been deposited. The procedure improved map-model correlation and increased the visibility of details in the maps.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTendon injury is a significant clinical problem, and regenerative treatments are limited by our understanding of endogenous tendon stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that tendon stem cells are diverse in phenotypic character, and may in fact exist on a spectrum of differentiation capacities. However, the functional significance of each differentiation phenotype is poorly understood. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive assessment of differentiation capacity toward four connective tissue lineages (adipose, bone, cartilage and tendon) with clonal tendon stem cell lines to: 1) evaluate the differences, if any, in tenogenic potential, and 2) identify the relationships in differentiation phenotype and proliferation capacity.\n\nMethodsTendon stem cells were derived from whole equine flexor tendons for this study (N=3). Clonal tendon stem lines were generated by low-density cell plating, and subjected to standard assays of tri-lineage differentiation and population doublings. For tenogenesis, a previously engineered three-dimensional hydrogel construct was incorporated. Differentiation was quantified by the relative gene expression of lineage-specific markers, and confirmed with lineage-specific cell staining. Tenogenesis was further analyzed by hydrogel contraction and histomorphometry. Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukeys tests.\n\nResultsThree distinct tendon stem cell phenotypes were identified, namely differentiation toward: 1) adipose, bone, cartilage and tendon, 2) bone, cartilage and tendon, or 3) adipose, cartilage and tendon. Further, a positive correlation was found in the ability to differentiate toward all four lineages and the generation of a robust, composite tendon-like construct upon tenogenesis, manifested by the strongest expressions of scleraxis and mohawk, and parallel alignment of tenocyte-like cells with elongated cell morphologies. Significantly increased numbers of cumulative cell population doublings were seen in the absence of adipogenic potential in clonal tendon stem cell lines.\n\nConclusionsOur study strengthens reports on the heterogeneous character of tendon stem cells and identifies key differences in their differentiation and proliferative potentials. Isolation of potent tendon stem cell populations from tendon stromal fractions may yield improved therapeutic benefits in clinical models of repair and promote a native, regenerative phenotype in engineered tendons. Future studies may be targeted to understanding the functional contributions of each tendon stem cell phenotype in vivo, and identifying additional cell phenotypes.",

These surface-derived cells become the main population of granulosa cells supporting primordial follicles, and differ in transcription from ELC derivatives. Reflecting their different cellular origins, ablation of Lgr5+ cells at E16.5 using Lgr5-DTR-EGFP eliminates second wave follicles, but first wave follicles continue to develop normally and support fertility. Our findings provide striking evidence that somatic cell behavior supporting germline cyst development in mice and Drosophila has been evolutionarily conserved.",

    "abstract": "Wheel-running exercise in laboratory rodents (animal model useful to study the neurobiology of aerobic exercise) decreases behavioral markers of vulnerability to addictive properties of various drugs of abuse including cocaine. However, neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this protective effect are far from being fully characterized and understood. Here, 28-day-old female C57BL/6J mice were housed with (n=48) or without (n=48) a running wheel for 6 weeks before being tested for acute locomotor responsiveness and initiation of locomotor sensitization to intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg/kg cocaine. The long-term expression of sensitization took place 3 weeks after the last session. On the day after, all mice underwent a microPET imaging session with [18F]fallypride radiotracer (dopamine 2/3 receptor (D2/3R) antagonist). Exercised mice were less sensitive to acute and sensitized cocaine hyperlocomotor effects, such attenuation being particularly well-marked for long-term expression of sensitization ({eta}2p = 0.262). Additionally, we found that chronic administrations of cocaine was associated with a clear-cut increase of [18F]fallypride binding potential in mouse striatum ({eta}2p = 0.170), presumably reflecting an increase in postsynaptic D2/3R density in this region. Finally, we found evidence that wheel-running exercise was associated with a moderate decrease in D2/3R density in striatum ({eta}2p = 0.075), a mechanism that might contribute to protective properties of such form of exercise against drugs of abuse vulnerability.",

We discover that Multiversal SpaceTime instead of Neural Network, governing physical and biological world at macroscopic and microscopic level, is the ultimate source of intelligence. With that we propose Multiversal Synthesis-based Artificial Design Automation (ADA), a bio-physical inspired model based on Multiverse in Darwin Dynamics, Generalized Quantum Mechanics, and Extended General Relativity, for Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) implementation. Based on Schrodinger Equation of Quantum Mechanics, we generalize the 4-Dimensional Hilbert Space based Discrete Quantum SpaceTime to N-Dimensional (1 << N < M, with M is limited by Planck Length) Hilbert Space based Discrete MSpaceTime as part of MSpaceTime, in modeling both Micro-Environment Intelligence and Micro-Agent Intelligence of ASI; likewise based on Einstein Equations of General Relativity, we make a T-Symmetry extension first, and then extend the 4-Dimensional Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold based Continuous Curved SpaceTime as part of MSpaceTime to N-Dimensional (1 << N < {infty}) Pseudo-Riemannian Manifold based Continuous MSpaceTime extension, in modeling both Macro-Environment Intelligence and Macro-Agent Intelligence of ASI. Our discovery only solves the black box puzzle of AI, but also paves the way in achieving ASI through ADA. Of course, our Multiverse Endeavor will never stop from there.",

    "abstract": "Viral endocytosis involves elastic cell deformation, driven by chemical adhesion energy, and depends on physical interactions between virion and cell membrane. These interactions are not easy to quantify experimentally. Hence, this study aimed to develop a mathematical model of the interactions of HIV particles with host cells and explore the effects of mechanical and morphological parameters during full virion engulfment. The invagination force and engulfment energy were described as viscoelastic and linear-elastic functions of radius and elastic modulus of virion and cell, ligand-receptor energy density and engulfment depth. The influence of changes in the virion-cell contact geometry representing different immune cells and ultrastructural membrane features and the decrease in virion radius and shedding of gp120 proteins during maturation on invagination force and engulfment energy was investigated. A low invagination force and high ligand-receptor energy are associated with high virion entry ability. The required invagination force was the same for immune cells of different sizes but lower for a local convex geometry of the cell membrane at the virion length scale. This suggests that localized membrane features of immune cells play a role in viral entry ability. The available engulfment energy decreased during virion maturation, indicating the involvement of additional biological or biochemical changes in viral entry. The developed mathematical model offers potential for the mechanobiological assessment of the invagination of enveloped viruses towards improving the prevention and treatment of viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous vibriophages represent a massive repertoire of virulence factors which can be transferred across species boundaries, leading to the emergence of deadly pathogens. All filamentous vibriophages that were characterized until today were isolated from human pathogens. Considering frequent horizontal gene transfer among vibrios, we predict that other environmental isolates, including non-human pathogens also carry filamentous phages, of which some may encode virulence factors.\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the phage repertoire, consisting of prophages and filamentous phages, of a marine pathogen, Vibrio alginolyticus. To do so, we sequenced eight different V. alginolyticus strains, isolated from different pipefish and characterised their phage repertoire using a combination of morphological analyses and comparative genomics.\n\nWe were able to identify a total of five novel phage regions (three different Caudovirales and two different Inoviridae), whereby only those two loci predicted to correspond to filamentous phages (family Inoviridae) represent actively replicating phages. Unique for this study was that all eight host strains, which were isolated from different eukaryotic hosts have identical bacteriophages, suggesting a clonal expansion of this strain after the phages had been acquired by a common ancestor. We further found that co-occurrence of two different filamentous phages leads to within-host competition resulting in reduced phage replication by one of the two phages. One of the two filamentous phages encoded two virulence genes (Ace and Zot), homologous to those encoded on the V. cholerae phage CTX{Phi}. The coverage of these zot-encoding phages correlated positively with virulence (measured in controlled infection experiments on the eukaryotic host), suggesting that this phages is an important virulence determinant.\n\nImpact statementMany bacteria of the genus Vibrio, such as V. cholerae or V. parahaemolyticus impose a strong threat to human health. Often, small viruses, known as filamentous phages encode virulence genes. Upon infecting a bacterial cell, these phages can transform a previously harmless bacterium into a deadly pathogen. While filamentous phages and their virulence factors are well-characterized for human pathogenic vibrios, filamentous phages of marine vibrios, pathogenic for a wide range of marine organisms, are predicted to carry virulence factors, but have so far not been characterized in depth. Using whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics of phages isolated from a marine fish pathogen V. alginolyticus, we show that also environmental strains harbour filamentous phages that carry virulence genes. These phages were most likely acquired from other vibrios by a process known as horizontal gene transfer. We found that these phages are identical across eight different pathogenic V. alginolyticus strains, suggesting that they have been acquired by a common ancestor before a clonal expansion of this ecotype took place. The phages characterized in this study have not been described before and are unique for the Kiel V. alginolyticus ecotype.\n\nData SummaryO_LIThe GenBank accession numbers for all genomic sequence data analysed in the present study can be found in Table S1.\nC_LIO_LIAll phage regions identified by PHASTER analysis of each chromosome and the respective coverage of active phage loci are listed in Table S2.\nC_LIO_LIGenBank files were deposited at NCBI for the two actively replicating filamentous phages VALG{Phi}6 (Accession number: MN719123) and VALG{Phi}8 (Accession number: MN690600)\nC_LIO_LIThe virulence data from the infection experiments have been deposited at PANGAEA: Accession number will be provided upon acceptance of the manuscript.\nC_LI\n\nData statementAll supporting data have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

    "abstract": "The smooth conduction of movements requires simultaneous motor planning and execution according to internal goals. So far it is not known how such movement plans can be modified without being distorted by ongoing movements. Previous studies have isolated planning and execution related neuronal activity by separating behavioral planning and movement periods in time by sensory cues1-7. Here, we introduced two novel tasks in which motor planning developed intrinsically. We separated this continuous self-paced motor planning statistically from motor execution by experimentally minimizing the repetitiveness of the movements. Thereby, we found that in the rat sensorimotor cortex, neuronal motor planning processes evolved with slower dynamics than movement related responses both on a sorted unit and population level. The fast evolving neuronal activity preceded skilled forelimb movements while it coincided with movements in a locomotor task. We captured this fast evolving movement related activity via a high-pass filter approach and confirmed the results with optogenetic stimulations. As biological mechanism underlying such a high pass filtering we suggest neuronal adaption. The differences in dynamics combined with a high pass filtering mechanism represents a simple principle for concurrent motor planning and execution in which planning will result in relatively slow dynamics that will not produce movements.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a systemic disease triggered by a local autoimmune inflammatory reaction in insulin-producing cells that disrupts the glucose-insulin-glucagon system and induces organ-wide, long-term effects on glycolytic and nonglycolytic processes. Mathematical modeling of the whole-body regulatory bihormonal system has helped to identify intervention points to ensure better control of T1D but was limited to a coarse-grained representation of metabolism. To extend the depiction of T1D, we developed a whole-body model using a novel integrative modeling framework that links organ-specific regulation and metabolism. The developed framework allowed the correct prediction of disrupted metabolic processes in T1D, highlighted pathophysiological processes common with neurodegenerative disorders, and suggested calcium channel blockers as potential adjuvants for diabetes control. Additionally, the model predicted the occurrence of insulin-dependent rewiring of interorgan crosstalk. Moreover, a simulation of a population of virtual patients allowed an assessment of the impact of inter and intraindividual variability on insulin treatment and the implications for clinical outcomes. In particular, GLUT4 was suggested as a potential pharmacogenomic regulator of intraindividual insulin efficacy. Taken together, the organ-resolved, dynamic model may pave the way for a better understanding of human pathology and model-based design of precise allopathic strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysing whole genome bisulfite sequencing datasets is a data-intensive task that requires comprehensive and reproducible workflows to generate valid results. While many algorithms have been developed for tasks such as alignment, comprehensive end-to-end pipelines are still sparse. Furthermore, previous pipelines lack features or show technical deficiencies, thus impeding analyses.\n\nResultsWe developed wg-blimp (whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylation analysis pipeline) as an end-to-end pipeline to ease whole genome bisulfite sequencing data analysis. It integrates established algorithms for alignment, quality control, methylation calling, detection of differentially methylated regions, and methylome segmentation, requiring only a reference genome and raw sequencing data as input. Comparing wg-blimp to previous end-to-end pipelines reveals similar setups for common sequence processing tasks, but shows differences for post-alignment analyses. We improve on previous pipelines by providing a more comprehensive analysis workflow as well as an interactive user interface. To demonstrate wg-blimps ability to produce correct results we used it to call differentially methylated regions for two publicly available datasets. We were able to replicate 112 of 114 previously published regions, and found results to be consistent with previous findings. We further applied wg-blimp to a publicly available sample of embryonic stem cells to showcase methylome segmentation. As expected, unmethylated regions were in close proximity of transcription start sites. Segmentation results were consistent with previous analyses, despite different reference genomes and sequencing techniques.\n\nConclusionswg-blimp provides a comprehensive analysis pipeline for whole genome bisulfite sequencing data as well as a user interface for simplified result inspection. We demonstrated its applicability by analysing multiple publicly available datasets. Thus, wg-blimp is a relevant alternative to previous analysis pipelines and may facilitate future epigenetic research.",

However, no systematic approach to understanding how candidate pathways relate to each other for a given cancer (such as Acute myeloid leukemia), and how one type of cancer may be similar or different from another with regard to their respective pathways (Acute myeloid leukemia vs. Glioblastoma multiforme for instance), has emerged thus far. Our work attempts to contribute to the understanding of space of pathways through a novel topological framework. We illustrate our approach, using mutation data (obtained from TCGA) of two types of tumors: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We find that the space of pathways for AML is homotopy equivalent to a sphere, while that of GBM is equivalent to a genus-2 surface.

    "abstract": "Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics; however, the spread of plasmid-encoded carbapenemases such as the New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) challenges their effectiveness. The rise of NDM-1 has coincided with the emergence of extensively multidrug resistant (MDR) lineages such as Escherichia coli ST101. Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of seven E. coli ST101 isolates that carry the blaNDM-1 gene. We determined the complete genomes of two isolates and the draft genomes of five isolates, enabling complete resolution of the plasmid context of blaNDM-1. Comparisons with thirteen previously published ST101 genomes revealed a monophyletic lineage within the B1 phylogroup forming two clades (designated Clade 1 and Clade 2). Most Clade 1 strains are MDR, encoding resistance to at least 9 different antimicrobial classes, including extended spectrum cephalosporins. Additionally, we characterised different pathways for blaNDM-1 carriage and persistence in the ST101 lineage. For IncC plasmids, carriage was associated with recombination and local transposition events within the antibiotic resistance island. In contrast, we revealed recent transfer of a large blaNDM-1 resistance island between F-type plasmids. The complex acquisition pathways characterised here highlight the benefits of long-read Single Molecule Real Time sequencing in revealing evolutionary events that would not be apparent by short-read sequencing alone. These high-quality E. coli ST101 genomes will provide an important reference for further analysis of the role of mobile genetic elements in this emerging multidrug resistant lineage.\n\nImportanceCarbapenem resistant Escherichia coli are urgent priority organisms as they are resistant to our drugs of last resort. E. coli ST101 have been reported as carriers of the New Delhi Metallo-beta-Lactamase 1 gene (blaNDM-1), conferring resistance to carbapenems, however there is limited genomic information available for this lineage. In this study we used long-read genome sequencing to characterise the complete genomes of two E. coli ST101 strains and determine the carriage of blaNDM-1 in a collection of E. coli ST101 strains. We showed that carriage of blaNDM-1 and resistance determinants to eight other antimicrobial classes was confined to a single clade. We also showed two different pathways for the carriage of blaNDM-1, which was dependent on the type of plasmid. Long-read sequencing allowed us to show the full complexities of these resistance regions and highlighted how strains from an emerging E. coli lineage have become resistant to nearly all available antimicrobials.",

The host-pathogen interaction has a well described gene-for-gene resistance relationship, but to date neither candidate avirulence nor resistance genes have been identified. We sequenced a set of American, Canadian and UK isolates of known race type, along with three representatives of the closely related pathogen of the raspberry (Rubus idaeus), Phytophthora rubi, and found a clear population structure, with a high degree of nucleotide divergence seen between some race types and abundant private variation associated with race types 4 and 5. In contrast, between isolates defined as UK races 1, 2 & 3 (UK1-2-3) there was no evidence of gene loss or gain; or the presence of insertions/deletions (INDELs) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within or in proximity to putative pathogenicity genes could be found associated with race variation. Transcriptomic analysis of representative UK1-2-3 isolates revealed abundant expression variation in key effector family genes associated with pathogen race; however, further long read sequencing did not reveal any long range polymorphisms to be associated with avirulence to race UK2 or UK3 resistance, suggesting either control in trans or other stable forms of epigenetic modification modulating gene expression. This work reveals the combined power of population resequencing to uncover race structure in pathosystems and in planta transcriptomic analysis to identify candidate avirulence genes. This work has implications for the identification of putative avirulence genes in the absence of associated expression data and points towards the need for detailed molecular characterisation of mechanisms of effector regulation and silencing in oomycete plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOXA-48-like carbapenemases have become increasingly prevalent in healthcare settings worldwide. Their low-level activity against carbapenems makes them difficult to identify, causing problems for infection control. Here we present an outbreak of Escherichia coli producing OXA-181 (part of the OXA-48 family of carbapenemases) in a Queensland Hospital, and describe how we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the outbreak strain, determine the extent of transmission within the hospital and support infection control responses.\n\nMethods116 isolates were collected and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq to determine species, sequence type (ST) and presence of resistance genes. Core single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to determine strain relatedness. Three isolates were also sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore MinION to determine the context of the resistance genes.\n\nResultsOf 116 isolates, 85 (84 E. coli and one K. pneumoniae) from 78 patients (and two environmental sources) were related to the ongoing outbreak. The outbreak E. coli strain was found to be ST38 and carried blaOXA-181, blaCTX-M-15 and qnrS1 genes. Long read sequencing revealed blaOXA-181 to be carried on an IncX3 plasmid with qnrS1. blaCTX-M-15 was chromosomally integrated (via ISEcp1 insertion) in close proximity to a second qnrS1 gene. A search of the laboratory database identified an isolate with an identical unusual antibiogram from a patient recently admitted to a hospital in Vietnam, suggesting that the strain was introduced to the hospital. This conclusion was supported by WGS, as comparison of the strain to public data identified a close match to an E. coli recovered from Vietnam in 2011.\n\nConclusionA blaOXA-181-carrying E. coli ST38 strain was introduced to a Brisbane hospital and spread undetected throughout multiple wards over several months. Using WGS, we characterized the outbreak strain and unambiguously detected its presence throughout the hospital. We show how both WGS and infection control measures can be utilized to effectively terminate widespread transmission of an elusory pathogen.",

We mapped CVR of 6 episodic migraineurs and 5 headache-free controls (HC) with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under carbon dioxide (CO2) challenge of 30-second epochs with elevated end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) by 4-8mmHg. Three migraineurs have migraine without aura (MOA) and the other three have migraine with aura (MA). We found that only MOA subjects showed a reduced or negative BOLD response to CO2 at the red nucleus. All 3 MOA subjects were characterized by bilateral posterior communicating artery hypoplasia (bPCAH) identified by MR angiography (MRA). MOA and HC subjects did not show any significant difference in BOLD responses to CO2 challenge in cortical and white matter while MA subjects showed poor positive association between BOLD responses and PETCO2 in large territories of the cortex and white matter tracts. The combined use of fMRI under CO2 challenge and MRA presented a unique approach to investigate the mechanisms of episodic migraine in the interictal state demonstrating for the first time negative CVR at the red nucleus of the midbrain in patients with MOA.

    "abstract": "Antigen loss is a key mechanism how tumor cells escape from T-cell immunotherapy. Using a mouse model of melanoma we directly compared antigen downregulation by phenotypic adaptation with genetically hardwired antigen loss. Unexpectedly, genetic ablation of Pmel, the melanocyte differentiation antigen targeted by adoptively transferred CD8+ T-cells, impaired melanoma cell growth in untreated tumors due to competitive pressure exerted by the bulk wild-type population. This established an evolutionary scenario, where T-cell immunotherapy imposed a dynamic fitness switch on wild-type melanoma cells and antigen loss variants, which resulted in highly variable enrichment of the latter in recurrent tumors. Stochastic simulations by an individual-based continuous-time Markov process suggested variable fitness of subclones within the antigen loss variant population as the most likely cause, which was validated experimentally. In summary, we provide a framework to better understand how subclone heterogeneity in tumors influences immune selection of genetic antigen loss variants through stochastic events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudies using quantitative experimental methods have shown that intracellular spatial distribution of molecules plays a central role in many cellular systems. Spatially resolved computer simulations can integrate quantitative data from these experiments to construct physically accurate models of the systems. Although computationally expensive, microscopic resolution reaction-diffusion simulators, such as Spatiocyte can directly capture intracellular effects comprising diffusion-limited reactions and volume exclusion from crowded molecules by explicitly representing individual diffusing molecules in space. To alleviate the steep computational cost typically associated with the simulation of large or crowded intracellular compartments, we present a parallelized Spatiocyte method called pSpatiocyte.\n\nResultsThe new high-performance method employs unique parallelization schemes on hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice to efficiently exploit the resources of common workstations and large distributed memory parallel computers. We introduce a coordinate system for fast accesses to HCP lattice voxels, a parallelized event scheduler, a parallelized Gillespies direct-method for unimolecular reactions, and a parallelized event for diffusion and bimolecular reaction processes. We verified the correctness of pSpatiocyte reaction and diffusion processes by comparison to theory. To evaluate the performance of pSpatiocyte, we performed a series of parallelized diffusion runs on the RIKEN K computer. In the case of fine lattice discretization with low voxel occupancy, pSpatiocyte exhibited 74% parallel efficiency and achieved a speedup of 7686 times with 663552 cores compared to the runtime with 64 cores. In the weak scaling performance, pSpatiocyte obtained efficiencies of at least 60% with up to 663552 cores. When executing the Michaelis-Menten benchmark model on an eight-core workstation, pSpatiocyte required 45- and 55-fold shorter runtimes than Smoldyn and the parallel version of ReaDDy, respectively. As a high-performance application example, we study the dual phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of the MAPK system, a typical reaction network motif in cell signaling pathways.\n\nConclusionspSpatiocyte demonstrates good accuracies, fast runtimes and a significant performance advantage over well-known microscopic particle simulators for large-scale simulations of intracellular reaction-diffusion systems.

    "abstract": "Quantitative dynamical models are widely used to study cellular signal processing. A critical step in modeling is the estimation of unknown model parameters from experimental data. As model sizes and datasets are steadily growing, established parameter optimization approaches for mechanistic models become computationally extremely challenging. However, mini-batch optimization methods, as employed in deep learning, have better scaling properties. In this work, we adapt, apply, and benchmark mini-batch optimization for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models thereby establishing a direct link between dynamic modeling and machine learning. On our main application example, a large-scale model of cancer signaling, we benchmark mini-batch optimization against established methods, achieving better optimization results and reducing computation by more than an order of magnitude. We expect that our work will serve as a first step towards mini-batch optimization tailored to ODE models and enable modeling of even larger and more complex systems than what is currently possible.",

    "abstract": "Emotional contagion, the ability to feel what other individuals feel, is thought to be an important element of social life. In humans, emotional contagion has been shown to be stronger in women than men. Emotional contagion has been shown to exist also in rodents, and a growing number of studies explore the neural basis of emotional contagion in male rats and mice. These studies promise to shed light on the mechanisms that might go astray in psychiatric disorders characterized by dysfunctions of emotional contagion and empathy. Here we explore whether there are sex differences in emotional contagion in rats. We use an established paradigm in which a demonstrator rat receives footshocks while freezing is measured in both the demonstrator and an observer rat, which can hear, smell and see each other. By comparing pairs of male rats with pairs of female rats, we find (i) that female demonstrators freeze less when submitted to footshocks, but that (ii) the emotional contagion response, i.e. the degree of influence across the rats, does not depend on the sex of the rats. This was true whether emotional contagion was quantified based on the slope of a regression linking demonstrator and observer average freezing, or on Granger causality estimates of moment-to-moment freezing. The lack of sex differences in emotional contagion is compatible with an interpretation of emotional contagion as serving selfish danger detection.",

The expected heterozygosity (He) varied from 0.043 to 0.901 (mean 0.492). Moderate genetic diversity (He=0.405) among populations were revealed, with Danba identified as the center of genetic diversity. Mantel tests revealed a significant positive correlation between geographic and genetic distance among populations (r=0.592, P=0.0001), demonstrating consistency with the isolation by distance model. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) results indicated that the principal genetic variation existed within populations (73.48%) rather than among populations (26.52%). Bayesian structure analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) supported classification of the populations into three clusters. Based on the level of observed genetic diversity, three management unints were proposed as conservation measures.

To implement dilated convolution, we choose the transfer learning with four popular architectures: VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and InceptionV3. The HAM10000 dataset was utilized for training, validating, and testing, which contains a total of 10015 dermoscopic images of seven skin lesion classes with huge class imbalances.

Expression of the ALS-associated human FUS in C. elegans results in mislocalization and aggregation of FUS outside the nucleus, and leads to impaired neuromuscular behaviors. However, the mechanisms by which mutant FUS disrupts neuronal health and function remain partially understood. Here we investigated the impact of ALS-associated FUS on motor neuron health using correlative light and electron microscopy, electron tomography, and electrophysiology. Expression of ALS-associated FUS impairs synaptic vesicle docking at neuromuscular junctions, and leads to the emergence of a population of large and electron-dense filament-filled endosomes. Electrophysiological recording of neuromuscular transmission revealed reduced transmission from motor neurons to muscles. Together, these results suggest a potential direct or indirect role of human FUS in the organization of synaptic vesicles, and reduced transmission from motor neurons to muscles.\n\nSummary statementAn ALS-associated mutation in a trafficking protein disrupts the organization of the C. elegans neuromuscular junction.",

    "abstract": "After becoming disoriented, an organism must use the local environment to reorient and recover vectors to important locations. Debates over how this happens have been extensive. A new theory, Adaptive Combination, suggests that the information from different spatial cues are combined with Bayesian efficiency. To test this further, we modified the standard reorientation paradigm to be more amenable to Bayesian cue combination analyses while still requiring reorientation, still requiring participants to recall goal locations from memory, and focusing on situations that require the use of the allocentric (world-based; not egocentric) frame. 12 adults and 20 children at 5-7 years old were asked to recall locations in a virtual environment after a disorientation. They could use either a pair of landmarks at the North and South, a pair at the East and West, or both. Results were not consistent with Adaptive Combination. Instead, they are consistent with the use of the most useful (nearest) single landmark in isolation. We term this Adaptive Selection. Experiment 2 suggests that adults also use the Adaptive Selection method when they are not disoriented but still required to use a local allocentric frame. This suggests that the process of recalling a location in the allocentric frame is typically guided by the single most useful landmark, rather than a Bayesian combination of landmarks - regardless of whether the use of the allocentric frame is forced by disorientation or another method. These failures to benefit from a Bayesian strategy accord with the broad idea that there are important limits to Bayesian theories of the cognition, particularly for complex tasks such as allocentric recall.",

The performance of the Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer is evaluated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes in combination with FAIMS. We demonstrate that different compensation voltages (CVs) for FAIMS are optimal for DDA and DIA, respectively. Combining DIA with FAIMS using single CVs, the instrument surpasses 2500 unique peptides identified per minute. This enables quantification of >5000 proteins with short online LC gradients delivered by the Evosep One LC system allowing acquisition of 60 samples per day. The raw sensitivity of the instrument is evaluated by analyzing 5 ng of a HeLa digest from which >1000 proteins were reproducibly identified with 5 minute LC gradients using DIA-FAIMS. To demonstrate the versatility of the instrument we recorded an organ-wide map of proteome expression across 12 rat tissues quantified by tandem mass tags and label-free quantification using DIA with FAIMS to a depth of >10,000 proteins.",

    "abstract": "Bats are unique among mammals due to the ability of powered flight and exceptional longevity. They are also asymptomatic hosts for numerous viruses, including recently emerged zoonotic Henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, which are highly pathogenic for humans and other mammals. Better understanding of how bats control viral infection requires development of relevant permissive cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary cells, using a novel combination of ESRRB, CDX2, and c-MYC transcription factors, we generated bat reprogrammed cells exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics and a neural stem cell-like molecular signature. These cells present a unique interferon-stimulated transcriptomic signature and both produce and respond to interferon type-I, highlighting differences between stem cells from bats and other mammals. In contrast to primary bat cells, these reprogrammed cells are highly susceptible to infection by Henipavirus, thereby enabling isolation of new bat viruses, study of virus-bat interactions, and better understanding of bat biology.\n\nSummary sentenceSomatic reprogramming provides new bat stem cells with unique immune properties and original viral permissivness",

    "abstract": "Synthetic sex-ratio distorters based on X-chromosome shredding are predicted to be more efficient than sterile males for population suppression of malaria mosquitoes using genetic control. X-chromosome shredding operates through the targeted elimination of X-chromosome-bearing gametes during male spermatogenesis, resulting in males that have a high fraction of male offspring. Strains harboring autosomal constructs containing a modified endonuclease I-PpoI have now been developed in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, resulting in strong sex-ratio distortion towards males. Data are being gathered for these strains for submission of regulatory dossiers for contained use and subsequent field release in West Africa. Since autosomal X-shredders are transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and can be selected against their frequency in the population is expected to decline once releases are halted. However, any unintended transfer of the X-shredder to the Y-chromosome could theoretically change these dynamics: This could lead to 100% transmission of the newly Y-linked X-shredder to the predominant male-biased offspring and its insulation from negative selection in females, resulting in its potential spread in the population and ultimately to suppression. Here, we analyze plausible mechanisms whereby an autosomal X-shredder could become linked to the Y-chromosome after release and provide data regarding its potential for activity should it become linked to the Y-chromosome. Our results strongly suggest that Y-chromosome linkage through remobilization of the transposon used for the initial genetic transformation is unlikely, and that, in the unexpected event that the X-shredder becomes linked to the Y-chromosome, expression and activity of the X-shredder would likely be inhibited by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. We conclude that a functioning X-shredding-based Y-drive resulting from a naturally induced transposition or translocation of the transgene onto the Y-chromosome is unlikely.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous multi-slice (multiband) accelerated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides dramatically improved temporal and spatial resolution for resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies of the human brain in health and disease. However, multiband acceleration also poses unique challenges for denoising of subject motion induced data artifacts, the presence of which is a major confound in RSFC research that substantively diminishes reliability and reproducibility. We comprehensively evaluated existing and novel approaches to volume censoring-based motion denoising in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. We show that assumptions underlying common metrics for evaluating motion denoising pipelines, especially those based on quality control-functional connectivity (QC-FC) correlations and differences between high- and low-motion participants, are problematic, and appear to be inappropriate in their current widespread use as indicators of comparative pipeline performance and as targets for investigators to use when tuning pipelines for their own datasets. We further develop two new quantitative metrics that are instead agnostic to QC-FC correlations and other measures that rely upon the null assumption that no true relationships exist between trait measures of subject motion and functional connectivity, and demonstrate their use as benchmarks for comparing volume censoring methods. Finally, we develop and validate quantitative methods for determining dataset-specific optimal volume censoring parameters prior to the final analysis of a dataset, and provide straightforward recommendations and code for all investigators to apply this optimized approach to their own RSFC datasets.",

    "abstract": "Pregnant women are an especially vulnerable population, given the sensitivity of a developing fetus to chemical exposures. However, prescribing behavior for the gravid patient is guided on limited human data and conflicting cases of adverse outcomes due to the exclusion of pregnant populations from randomized, controlled trials. These factors increase risk for adverse drug outcomes and reduce quality of care for pregnant populations. Herein, we propose the application of artificial intelligence to systematically predict the teratogenicity of a prescriptible small molecule from information inherent to the drug. Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning, our model probes all small molecules with known structure and teratogenicity data published in research-amenable formats to identify patterns among structural, meta-structural, and in vitro bioactivity data for each drug and its teratogenicity score. With this workflow, we discovered three chemical functionalities that predispose a drug towards increased teratogenicity and two moieties with potentially protective effects. Our models predict three clinically-relevant classes of teratogenicity with AUC = 0.8 and nearly double the predictive accuracy of a blind control for the same task, suggesting successful modeling. We also present extensive barriers to translational research that restrict data-driven studies in pregnancy and therapeutically \"orphan\" pregnant populations. Collectively, this work represents a first-in-kind platform for the application of computing to study and predict teratogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule associated with many biochemical and physiological processes in plants under stressful conditions. Nitrate reductase (NR) not only mediates the reduction of NO3- to NO2- but also reduces NO2- to NO, a relevant pathway for NO production in higher plants. Herein, we hypothesized that sugarcane plants supplied with more NO3- as a source of N would produce more NO under water deficit. Such NO would reduce oxidative damage and favor photosynthetic metabolism and growth under water limiting conditions. Sugarcane plants were grown in nutrient solution and received the same amount of nitrogen, with varying nitrate:ammonium ratios (100:0 and 70:30). Plants were then grown under well-watered or water deficit conditions, in which the osmotic potential of nutrient solution was -0.15 and -0.75 MPa, respectively. Under water deficit, plants exhibited higher root [NO3-] and [NO2-] when supplied with 100% NO3-. Accordingly, the same plants also showed higher root NR activity and root NO production. We also found higher photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance in plants supplied with more NO3-, which improved root growth. ROS accumulation was reduced due to increases in the activity of catalase in leaves and superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase in roots of plants supplied with 100% NO3- and facing water deficit. Such positive responses to water deficit were offset when a NO scavenger was supplied to the plants, thus confirming that increases in leaf gas exchange and plant growth were induced by NO. Concluding, NO3- supply is an interesting strategy for alleviating the negative effects of water deficit on sugarcane plants, increasing drought tolerance through enhanced NO production. Our data also provide insights on how plant nutrition could improve crop tolerance against abiotic stresses, such as drought.\n\nHighlightsO_LINitrate supply improves sugarcane growth under water deficit.\nC_LIO_LINitrate supply stimulated nitrate reductase activity and NO synthesis in sugarcane roots facing water deficit.\nC_LIO_LILeaf gas exchange was increased by nitrate supply as well as root growth under water limiting conditions.\nC_LIO_LIAntioxidant responses were also improved in plants supplied exclusively with nitrate.\nC_LIO_LINitrogen management may be an interesting strategy for improving drought tolerance in sugarcane fields.\nC_LI",

Four species of Saprolegnia were identified, including S. anisospora and S. diclina as first reports for Iran. Evaluation of the ligno-, cellulo- and chitinolytic activities were also measured using plate assay methods. Most of the Saprolegniales isolates were obtained in autumn and nearly 50% of the strains showed chitinolytic and cellulolytic activities.

However, transferring structural knowledge to novel environments requires flexible representations that are generalizable over particularities of the current environment, such as its stimuli and size. We suggest that humans represent structural forms as abstract basis sets and that in novel tasks, the structural form is inferred and the relevant basis set is transferred. Using a computational model, we show that such representation allows inference of the underlying structural form, important task states, effective behavioural policies and the existence of unobserved state-trajectories. In two experiments, participants learned three abstract graphs during two successive days. We tested how structural knowledge acquired on Day-1 affected Day-2 performance. In line with our model, participants who had a correct structural prior were able to infer the existence of unobserved state-trajectories and appropriate behavioural policies.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is genetically associated with the H1 haplotype of the MAPT 17q.21.31 locus, although the causal gene and variants underlying this association have not been identified. To better understand the genetic contribution of this region to PD, we fine-mapped the 17q21.31 locus in order to identify novel mechanisms conferring risk for the disease. We identified three novel H1 sub-haplotype blocks across the 17q21.31 locus associated with PD risk. Protective sub-haplotypes were associated with increased LRRC37A/2 copy number and expression in human brain tissue. We found that LRRC37A/2 is a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis and astroglial inflammation. In human substantia nigra, LRRC37A/2 was primarily expressed in astrocytes, interacted directly with soluble -synuclein, and co-localized with Lewy bodies in PD brain tissue. These data indicate that a novel candidate gene, LRRC37A/2, contributes to the association between the 17q21.31 locus and PD via its interaction with -synuclein and its effects on astrocytic function and inflammatory response. These data are the first to associate the genetic association at the 17q21.31 locus with PD pathology, and highlight the importance of variation at the 17q21.31 locus in the regulation of multiple genes other than MAPT and KANSL1, as well as its relevance to non-neuronal cell types.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) regulates gene expression in most multicellular organisms through binding of small RNA effectors to target transcripts. Exploiting this process is a popular strategy for genetic manipulation in invertebrates and has applications that includes control of pests. Successful RNAi technologies are dependent on delivery method. The most convenient method is likely feeding which is effective in some animals while others are insensitive. Thus, there is a need to develop RNAi technology on a per-species basis, which will require a comprehensive approach for assessing small RNA production from synthetic nucleic acids.\n\nUsing a biochemical and sequencing approaches we investigated the metabolism of ingested RNAs using the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, as a model for RNAi insensitivity. This chelicerae arthropod shows only modest response to oral RNAi and has biogenesis pathways distinct from model organisms. To identify RNAi substrates in T. urticae we characterized processing of synthetic RNAs and those derived from plant transcripts ingested during feeding. Through characterization of read size length and overlaps of small RNA reads, visualization methods were developed that facilitate distinguish trans-acting small RNAs from degradation fragments.\n\nUsing a strategy that delineates small RNA classes, we found a variety of RNA species are gated into spider mite RNAi pathways, however, potential mature trans-acting RNAs appear very unstable and rare. This suggests spider mite RNAi pathway products that originate as ingested materials may be preferentially metabolized instead of converted into regulators of gene expression. Spider mites infest a variety of plants, and it would be maladaptive to generate diverse gene regulators from dietary RNAs. This study provides a framework for assessing RNAi technology in organisms where genetic and biochemical tools are absent and benefit rationale design of RNAi triggers.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex human traits, but only a fraction of variants identified in discovery studies achieve significance in replication studies. Replication in GWAS has been well-studied in the context of Winners Curse, which is the inflation of effect size estimates for significant variants due to statistical chance. However, Winners Curse is often not sufficient to explain lack of replication. Another reason why studies fail to replicate is that there are fundamental differences between the discovery and replication studies. A confounding factor can create the appearance of a significant finding while actually being an artifact that will not replicate in future studies. We propose a statistical framework that utilizes GWAS and replication studies to jointly model Winners Curse and study-specific heterogeneity due to confounding factors. We apply this framework to 100 GWAS from the Human GWAS Catalog and observe that there is a large range in the level of estimated confounding. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to distinguish when studies fail to replicate due to statistical noise and when they fail due to confounding.",

Previous studies have revealed task-related information being present at both the single-unit and population activity. However, its realization with respect to the cortical microcircuitry is less well understood. In this study, we used chronic, laminar current source density (CSD) analysis from the A1 of behaving Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in order to characterize layer-specific, spatiotemporal synaptic population activity. Animals were trained to first detect and subsequently to discriminate two pure tone frequencies in consecutive training phases in a Go/NoGo shuttle-box task. We demonstrate that not only sensory but also task- and choice-related information is represented in the mesoscopic neuronal population code distributed across cortical layers. Based on a single-trial analysis using generalized linear-mixed effect models (GLMM), we found infragranular layers to be involved in auditory-guided action initiation during tone detection. Supragranular layers, particularly, are involved in the coding of choice options during tone discrimination. Further, we found that the overall columnar synaptic network activity represents the accuracy of the opted choice. Our study thereby suggests a multiplexed representation of stimulus features in dependence of the task, action selection, and the behavioral options of the animal in preparation of correct choices. The findings expand our understanding of how individual layers contribute to the integrative circuit of the A1 in order to code task-relevant information and guide sensory-based decision making.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 has been involved in several mitochondrial functions, and modulation of its expression/activity has been suggested to play a role in the metabolic reprogramming distinctive of cancer cells. TRAP1 posttranslational modifications, i.e. phosphorylation, can modify its capability to bind to different client proteins and modulate its oncogenic activity. Recently, it has been also demonstrated that TRAP1 is S-nitrosylated at Cys501, a redox modification associated with its degradation via the proteasome. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations of TRAP1, together with analysis of long-range structural communication, providing a model according to which Cys501 S-nitrosylation induces conformational changes to distal sites in the structure of the protein. The modification is also predicted to alter open and closing motions for the chaperone function. By means of colorimetric assays and site directed mutagenesis aimed at generating C501S variant, we also experimentally confirmed that selective S-nitrosylation of Cys501 decreases ATPase activity of recombinant TRAP1. Coherently, C501S mutant was more active and conferred protection to cell death induced by staurosporine. Overall, our results provide the first in silico, in vitro and cellular evidence of the relevance of Cys501 S-nitrosylation in TRAP1 biology.",

    "abstract": "Genetic associations with biopsychosocial phenotypes are often interpreted as evidence that the genome codes for fixed end-states. Instead, a given genotype might regulate a dynamic range of phenotypes in response to environmental change. We collected hair cortisol (n = 1,104), salivary cortisol in reaction to an in-laboratory stressor (n = 537), and diurnal salivary cortisol (n = 488) from twins aged 8-15 years in the Texas Twin Project. Baseline genetic variation in both salivary and hair cortisol was not simply magnified after stressor exposure or after waking. Rather, novel genetic influences on cortisol arose over time. Thus, environmental change can reveal genetic variation that would not otherwise be observed in static cortisol levels. These findings are in line with the notion that the genome regulates individuals reactions to the environment that differ across environments.",

    "abstract": "In the studies of single-cell genomics, the large endeavor has been focused on the detection of the permanent changes in the genome. On the other hand, spontaneous DNA damage frequently occurs and results in transient single-stranded changes to the genome until they are repaired. So far, successful profiling of these dynamic changes has not been demonstrated by single-cell whole-genome amplification methods. Here we reported a novel single-cell WGA method: Linearly Produced Semiamplicon based Split Amplification Reaction (LPSSAR), which allows, for the first time, the genome-wide detection of the DNA damage associated single nucleotide variants (dSNVs) in single human cells. The sequence-based detection of dSNVs allows the direct characterization of the major damage signature that occurred in human cells. In the analysis of the abundance of dSNVs along the genome, we observed two modules of dSNV abundance, instead of a homogeneous abundance of dSNVs. Interestingly, we found that the two modules are associated with the A/B topological compartments of the genome. This result suggests that the genome topology directly influences genome stability. Furthermore, with the detection of a large number of dSNVs in single cells, we showed that only under a stringent filtering condition, can we distinguish the de novo mutations from the dSNVs and achieve a reliable estimation of the total level of de novo mutations in a single cell.",

In vivo the secondary lysogenization of symbiotic E. coli strains by the phages released by infecting STEC populations may contribute to the overall patient toxic load and to lead to the emergence of new pathogenic STEC strains. However, in our experiment all the phi24B lysogens obtained from the environmental E. coli isolates had compromised O-antigen (Oag) biosynthesis. These lysogenic strains gained the sensitivity to the T5-like bacteriophages and featured increased sensitivity to the bactericidal activity of the horse serum. We conclude that in most of E. coli strains the Oag effectively restricts phi24B infection. The lysogenic clones predominantly rise from the Oag deficient mutants and therefore they have reduced fitness compared to the parental strain.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceMicrostructural alterations in cortico-subcortical connections are thought to be present in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, prior studies have yielded inconsistent findings, perhaps because small sample sizes provided insufficient power to detect subtle abnormalities.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate microstructural white matter alterations and their relation to clinical features in the largest dataset of adult and pediatric OCD to date.\n\nDesign, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this cross-sectional case-control magnetic resonance study, we investigated diffusion tensor imaging metrics from 700 adult patients and 645 adult controls, as well as 174 pediatric patients and 144 pediatric controls across 19 sites participating in the ENIGMA-OCD Working Group.\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresWe extracted measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) as main outcome, and mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity as secondary outcomes for 25 white matter regions. We meta-analyzed patient-control group differences (Cohens d) across sites, after adjusting for age and sex, and investigated associations with clinical characteristics.\n\nResultsAdult OCD patients showed significant FA reduction in the sagittal stratum (d=-0.21, z=-3.21, p=0.001) and posterior thalamic radiation (d=-0.26, z=-4.57, p<0.0001). In the sagittal stratum only, lower FA was associated with a younger age of onset (z=2.71, p=0.006), longer duration of illness (z=-2.086, p=0.036) and a higher percentage of medicated patients in the cohorts studied (z=-1.98, p=0.047). No significant association with symptom severity was found. Pediatric OCD patients did not show any detectable microstructural abnormalities compared to matched controls.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceMicrostructural alterations in projection and association fibers to posterior brain regions were found in adult OCD, and related to disease course and medication status. Such results are relevant to models positing deficits in connectivity as a crucial mechanism in OCD.\n\nKEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) show white matter microstructural alterations, and are these alterations related to clinical features?\n\nFindingsData from 19 sites of the ENIGMA-OCD Consortium were included, involving 700 adult patients and 645 adult controls, 174 pediatric patients and 144 pediatric controls. Diffusion tensor imaging data were meta-analyzed using a harmonized data processing and analysis protocol. Adult, but not pediatric, patients showed alterations in the sagittal stratum and posterior thalamic radiation; sagittal stratum differences were associated with clinical features.\n\nMeaningMicrostructural abnormalities found in adult but not in the pediatric cohort, are related to illness duration and medication status.",

    "abstract": "Sequence variants of the microglial expressed TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) are a major risk factor for late onset Alzheimers disease. TREM2 requires a stable interaction with DAP12 in the membrane to initiate signaling, which is terminated by TREM2 ectodomain shedding and subsequent intramembrane cleavage by {gamma}-secretase. To understand the structural basis for the specificity of the intramembrane cleavage event, we determined the solution structure of the TREM2 transmembrane helix (TMH). Due to the presence of a charged amino acid in the membrane region the TREM2-TMH adopts a kinked structure with increased flexibility. Charge removal leads to TMH stabilization and reduced dynamics, similar to its structure in complex with DAP12. Strikingly, these dynamical features perfectly correlate with the site of the initial {gamma}-secretase cleavage event. These data suggest an unprecedented cleavage mechanism by {gamma}-secretase where flexible TMH regions are identified to initiate substrate cleavage.",

    "abstract": "The APETALA2 (AP2) subfamily of transcription factors are key regulators of angiosperm root, shoot, flower, and embryo development. The broad diversity of anatomical and morphological structures is potentially associated with the genomic dynamics of the AP2 subfamily. However, a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of the AP2 subfamily across angiosperms is lacking. We combined phylogenetic and synteny analysis of distinct AP2 subclades in the completed genomes of 107 angiosperm species. We identified major changes in copy number variation and genomic context within subclades across lineages, and discuss how these changes may have contributed to the evolution of lineage-specific traits. Multiple AP2 subclades show highly conserved patterns of copy number and synteny across angiosperms, while others are more dynamic and show distinct lineage-specific patterns. As examples of lineage-specific morphological divergence due to AP2 subclade dynamics, we hypothesize that that loss of PLETHORA1/2 in monocots correlates with the absence of taproots, whereas independent lineage-specific changes of PLETHORA4/BABY BOOM and WRINKLED1 genes in Brassicaceae and monocots point towards regulatory divergence of embryogenesis between these lineages. Additionally, copy number expansion of TOE1 and TOE3/AP2 in asterids is implicated with differential regulation of flower development. Moreover, we show that the genomic context of AP2s is in general highly specialised per angiosperm lineage. Our study is the first to shed light on the evolutionary divergence of the AP2 subfamily subclades across major angiosperm lineages and emphasises the need for lineage-specific characterisation of developmental networks to further understand trait variability.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAPETALA2 transcription factors are crucial regulators of embryogenesis and post-embryonic development in plants. Characterising the genomic dynamics of APETALA2 genes across 107 angiosperms provided evolutionary insights into gene-family and morphological divergence across major angiosperm lineages.",

    "abstract": "It is now clear that hybridization between species is much more common than previously recognized. As a result, we now know that the genomes of many modern species, including our own, are a patchwork of regions derived from past hybridization events. Increasingly researchers are interested in disentangling which regions of the genome originated from each parental species using local ancestry inference methods. Due to the diverse effects of admixture, this interest is shared across disparate fields, from human genetics to research in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, local ancestry inference methods are sensitive to a range of biological and technical parameters which can impact accuracy. Here we present paired simulation and ancestry inference pipelines, mixnmatch and ancestryinfer, to help researchers plan and execute local ancestry inference studies. mixnmatch can simulate arbitrarily complex demographic histories in the parental and hybrid populations, selection on hybrids, and technical variables such as coverage and contamination. ancestryinfer takes as input sequencing reads from simulated or real individuals, and implements an efficient local ancestry inference pipeline. We perform a series of simulations with mixnmatch to pinpoint factors that influence accuracy in local ancestry inference and highlight useful features of the two pipelines. Together, mixnmatch and ancestryinfer are powerful tools for predicting the performance of local ancestry inference methods on real data.",

    "abstract": "The general architecture of the olfactory system is highly conserved from insects to humans, but neuroanatomical and physiological differences can be observed across species. The American cockroach, inhabiting dark shelters with a rather stable olfactory landscape, is equipped with long antennae used for sampling the surrounding air-space for orientation and navigation. The antennaes exceptional length provides a wide spatial working range for odour detection; however, it is still largely unknown whether and how this is also used for mapping the structure of the olfactory environment. By selective labelling antennal lobe projection neurons with a calcium sensitive dye, we investigated the logic of olfactory coding in this hemimetabolous insect. We show that odour responses are stimulus-specific and concentration-dependent, and that structurally related odorants evoke physiologically similar responses. By using spatially confined stimuli, we show that proximal stimulations induce stronger and faster responses than distal ones. Spatially confined stimuli of the female pheromone periplanone-B activate sub-region of the male macroglomerulus. Thus, we report that the combinatorial logic of odour coding deduced from holometabolous insects applies also to this hemimetabolous species. Furthermore, a fast decrease in sensitivity along the antenna, not supported by a proportionate decrease in sensillar density, suggests a neural architecture that strongly emphasizes neuronal inputs from the proximal portion of the antenna.\n\nSummary statementBy selective labelling the cockroachs antennal lobe output neurons, we investigated the logic of olfactory coding in a hemimetabolous insect, showing that odour responses are stimulus-specific, concentration-dependent, and preserve information on the spatial structure of the stimulus.",

Using a new antibody, endogenous neuronal SNX4 co-localized with both early and recycling endosomes, similar to the reported localization of SNX4 in non-neuronal cells. Neuronal SNX4 was accumulated in synapses, and immuno-electron microscopy revealed that SNX4 was predominantly localized to presynaptic terminals. Acute depletion of neuronal SNX4 using independent shRNAs did not affect the levels of the canonical SNX4-cargo transferrin receptor. Explorative mass spectrometry showed that each SNX4-targetted shRNA resulted in a reproducible and distinct proteome and that synaptic communication-related proteins were downregulated upon expression of the three shRNAs.

    "abstract": "The long-held view that bird song is exclusively a male trait has been challenged recently by a number of studies and reviews highlighting the prevalence of female song. In spite of that, there remains a lack of knowledge on the function of female song, with most evidence thus far focusing on females performing duets with males in courtship displays, typically for joint territory defence or mate guarding purposes. Here we show in a tracheophone suboscine passerine Formicarius moniliger, a sexually monomorphic species in which both sexes sing, that females may participate in both intrasexual and intersexual territory defence. Females sing more in response to females than to males, suggesting they consider females more of a threat to their territory. Yet, females also demonstrate an unexpected pattern of singing back to playback of males singing higher frequency song than themselves. Unlike males, who respond indiscriminately to playback of any song performed by either sex, females appear to discern not only the sex, but perhaps also the size of the presumed intruder. There is a strong negative relationship between body mass and frequency, and females responding only to higher frequency male song suggests they will only engage in territory defence with males when they expect those males to be weaker than they are. While our results are consistent with expectations of a shared ancestral function of song in territory defence, they also suggest females may suffer greater costs in engaging in territorial disputes and thus limit their vocal contribution according to the perceived threat.",

    "abstract": "In most bacteria, cell division begins with the polymerization of the GTPase FtsZ at the mid-cell, which recruits the division machinery to initiate cell constriction. In the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces, cell division is positively controlled by SsgB, which recruits FtsZ to the future septum sites and promotes Z-ring formation. Here we show via site-saturated mutagenesis that various amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved SsgB protein result in the production of ectopically placed septa, that sever spores diagonally or along the long axis, perpendicular to the division plane. Ectopic septa were especially prominent when cells expressed SsgB variants with substitutions in residue E120. Biochemical analysis of SsgB variant E120G revealed that its interaction with - and polymerization of - FtsZ had been maintained. The crystal structure of S. coelicolor SsgB was resolved and the position of residue E120 suggests its requirement for maintaining the proper angle of helix 3, thus providing a likely explanation for the aberrant septa formed in SsgB E120 substitution mutants. Taken together, our work presents the first example of longitudinal division in a free living bacterium, which is explained entirely by changes in the FtsZ-recruiting protein SsgB.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing, a ubiquitous phenomenon in eukaryotes, is a regulatory mechanism for the biological diversity of individual genes. Most studies have focused on the effects of alternative splicing for protein synthesis. However, the transcriptome-wide influence of alternative splicing on RNA subcellular localization has rarely been studied. By analyzing RNA-seq data obtained from subcellular fractions across 13 human cell lines, we identified 8720 switching genes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Consistent with previous reports, intron retention was observed to be enriched in the nuclear transcript variants. Interestingly, we found that short and structurally stable introns were positively correlated with nuclear localization. Motif analysis reveals that fourteen RNA-binding protein (RBPs) are prone to be preferentially bound with such introns. To our knowledge, this is the first transcriptome-wide study to analyze and evaluate the effect of alternative splicing on RNA subcellular localization. Our findings reveal that alternative splicing plays a promising role in regulating RNA subcellular localization.",

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations reflect system-level neural dynamics and capture the current brain state. These brain rhythms can be measured noninvasively in humans with electroencephalography (EEG). Up and down states of brain oscillations capture local changes in neuronal excitability. This makes them a promising target for non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Real-time EEG-TMS systems record ongoing brain signals, process the data, and deliver TMS stimuli at a specific brain state. Despite their promise to increase the temporal specificity of stimulation, best practices and technical solutions are still under development. Here, we implement and compare state-of-the-art methods (Fourier based, Autoregressive Prediction) for real-time EEG-TMS and evaluate their performance both in silico and experimentally. We further propose a new robust algorithm for delivering real-time EEG phase-specific stimulation based on short prerecorded EEG training data (Educated Temporal Prediction). We found that Educated Temporal Prediction performs at the same level or better than Fourier-based or Autoregressive methods both in silico and in vivo, while being computationally more efficient. Further, we document a dependency of EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on algorithm accuracy across all algorithms. In conclusion, our results can give important insights for real-time TMS-EEG technical development as well as experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic regulation of organ structure is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. Here, we use egg-producing structures of insect ovaries, called ovarioles, to deduce systems-level gene regulatory relationships from quantitative functional genetic analysis. We previously showed that Hippo signalling, a conserved regulator of animal organ size, regulates ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster. To comprehensively determine how Hippo signalling interacts with other pathways in this regulation, we screened all known signalling pathway genes, and identified Hpo-dependent and Hpo-independent signalling requirements. Network analysis of known protein-protein interactions among screen results identified independent gene regulatory sub-networks regulating one or both of ovariole number and egg laying. These sub-networks predict involvement of previously uncharacterised genes with higher accuracy than the original candidate screen. This shows that network analysis combining functional genetic and large-scale interaction data can predict function of novel genes regulating development.",

    "abstract": "Proteostasis collapse, the diminished ability to maintain protein homeostasis, has been established as a hallmark of nematode aging. However, whether proteostasis collapse occurs in humans has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that proteostasis decline is intrinsic to human senescence. Using transcriptome-wide characterization of gene expression, splicing and translation, we found a significant deterioration in the transcriptional activation of the heat shock response in stressed senescent cells. Furthermore, phosphorylated HSF1 nuclear localization and distribution were impaired in senescence. Interestingly, alternative splicing regulation was also dampened. Surprisingly, we found a decoupling between different Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) branches in stressed senescent cells. While young cells initiated UPR-related translational and transcriptional regulatory responses, senescent cells showed enhanced translational regulation and ER stress sensing, however they were unable to trigger UPR-related transcriptional responses. This was accompanied by diminished ATF6 nuclear localization in stressed senescent cells. Finally, we revealed a deterioration of proteasome function in senescence following heat stress, which did not recover upon return to normal temperature. Together, our data unraveled a deterioration in the ability to mount dynamic stress transcriptional programs upon human senescence with broad implications on proteostasis control, and connected proteostasis decline to human aging.\n\nSignificanceProtein homeostasis (proteostasis), the balance between protein synthesis, folding, and degradation, is thought to deteriorate with age, and the prevalence of protein misfolding diseases, e.g. Alzheimers, Parkinsons etc., with human aging is increased. However, while in worms this phenomenon has been well established, in humans it remained unclear. Here we show that proteostasis is declined in human senescence, i.e. cellular aging. We found that while stress sensing is enhanced in senescent cells, and their response at the level of protein synthesis is intact, they fail to properly activate multiple programs required for stress adaptation at the level of gene transcription. Our findings support the notion that proteostasis decline may have major implications on human aging.",
