    "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is crucial for adaptation and is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders and psychopathology. Human studies of flexibility using reversal learning tasks typically contrast error trials before and after reversal, which provides little information about the mechanisms that support learning and expressing a new response. However, animal studies suggest a specific role in this latter process for the connections between the dorsal striatum and the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) thalamus, a system which may recruit the striatal cholinergic interneurons, but which is not well understood in humans. This study investigated the role of this system in human probabilistic reversal learning, specifically with respect to learning a new response strategy, contrasting its function to that of the better understood orbitoftontal-striatal systems. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data we show that connectivity between the striatum and both the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and CM-Pf pathways increased during reversal, but not initial learning. However, while the strength of lOFC-striatal connectivity was associated with the speed of the reversal, the strength of CM-Pf-striatal connectivity was associated specifically with the quality of the reversal (reduced regressive errors). These findings expand our understanding of flexibility mechanisms in the human brain, bridging the gap with animal studies of this system.",

A critical challenge is to test whether specific biomes, taxa or types of species benefit or suffer in a time of accelerating global change.

We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We found that 15% of populations declined, 18% increased, and 67% showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncovered a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species rarity and global-scale threats.

    "abstract": "BackgroundNearly half the human genome consists of repeat elements, most of which are retrotransposons, and many of these sequences play important biological roles. However repeat elements pose several unique challenges to current bioinformatic analyses and visualization tools, as short repeat sequences can map to multiple genomic loci resulting in their misclassification and misinterpretation. In fact, sequence data mapping to repeat elements are often discarded from analysis pipelines. Therefore, there is a continued need for standardized tools and techniques to interpret genomic data of repeats.\n\nResultsWe present the UCSC Repeat Browser, which consists of a complete set of human repeat reference sequences derived from the gold standard repeat database RepeatMasker. The UCSC Repeat Browser contains mapped annotations from the human genome to these references, and presents all of them as a comprehensive interface to facilitate work with repetitive elements. Furthermore, it provides processed tracks of multiple publicly available datasets of biological interest to the repeat community, including ChIP-SEQ datasets for KRAB Zinc Finger Proteins (KZNFs) - a family of proteins known to bind and repress certain classes of repeats. Here we show how the UCSC Repeat Browser in combination with these datasets, as well as RepeatMasker annotations in several non-human primates, can be used to trace the independent trajectories of species-specific evolutionary conflicts.\n\nConclusionsThe UCSC Repeat Browser allows easy and intuitive visualization of genomic data on consensus repeat elements, circumventing the problem of multi-mapping, in which sequencing reads of repeat elements map to multiple locations on the human genome. By developing a reference consensus, multiple datasets and annotation tracks can easily be overlaid to reveal complex evolutionary histories of repeats in a single interactive window. Specifically, we use this approach to retrace the history of several primate specific LINE-1 families across apes, and discover several species-specific routes of evolution that correlate with the emergence and binding of KZNFs.",

N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene and inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis. However, whether NDRG2 affects colitis initiation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer is unclear. Here, We found that intestine-specific Ndrg2 deficiency caused mild spontaneous colitis with ageing, aggravated DSS and TNBS induced colitis, increased AOM-DSS induced colitis-associated tumor. Ndrg2 loss led to adherens junction (AJ) structure destruction via E-cadherin expression attenuation, resulting in diminished epithelial barrier function and increased intestinal epithelial permeability.

In human ulcerative colitis patients, reduced NDRG2 expression is positively correlated with severe inflammation. These findings demonstrate that NDRG2 is an essential colonic epithelial barrier regulator and plays important role in gut homeostasis maintenance and colitis-associated tumor development.\n\nSUMMARYAdherens junctoin (AJ) as the key part of intestinal epithelial barrier plays important role in the pathogenesis of IBDs.

    "abstract": "Evolution without sex is predicted to impact genomes in numerous ways. Case studies of individual parthenogenetic animals have reported peculiar genomic features which were suggested to be caused by their mode of reproduction, including high heterozygosity, a high abundance of horizontally acquired genes, a low transposable element load, or the presence of palindromes. We systematically characterized these genomic features in published genomes of 26 parthenogenetic animals representing at least 18 independent transitions to asexuality. Surprisingly, not a single feature was systematically replicated across a majority of these transitions, suggesting that previously reported patterns were lineage specific rather than illustrating general consequences of parthenogenesis. We found that only parthenogens of hybrid origin were characterized by high heterozygosity levels. Parthenogens that were not of hybrid origin appeared to be largely homozygous, independently of the cellular mechanism underlying parthenogenesis. Overall, despite the importance of recombination rate variation for the evolution of sexual animal genomes, the genome-wide absence of recombination does not appear to have had the dramatic effects which are expected from classical theoretical models. The reasons for this are probably a combination of lineage-specific patterns, impact of the origin of parthenogenesis, and a survivorship bias of parthenogenetic lineages.",

We describe the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate environmental sources of transmission during an outbreak of extended-spectrum-{beta}-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella michiganensis colonizing neonates.\n\nMethodsCeftriaxone-resistant Klebsiella spp. isolated from neonates (or their mothers) and the hospital environment were included. Short-read (Illumina) and long-read (MinION, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) sequencing was used to confirm species taxonomy, define antimicrobial resistance genes and determine phylogenetic relationships using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiling.\n\nResultsA total of 21 organisms (10 patient-derived and 11 environmental isolates) were sequenced. Standard laboratory methods identified the outbreak strain as an ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca, but taxonomic assignment from WGS data suggested closer identity to Klebsiella michiganensis. Strains isolated from baby bath drains and multiple detergent dispensing bottles were either identical or closely related by SNP comparison. Detergent bottles contaminated by K. michiganensis had been used for washing milk-expressing equipment. No new cases were identified once the detergent bottles were removed and the baby baths decommissioned.\n\nConclusionsEnvironmental reservoirs may be an important source in outbreaks of multi-drug resistant organisms.

    "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and obesity are frequently comorbid, genetically correlated, and share brain substrates. The biological mechanisms driving this association are unclear, but candidate systems, like dopaminergic neurotransmission and circadian rhythm, have been suggested. Our aim was to identify the biological mechanisms underpinning the genetic link between ADHD and obesity measures and investigate associations of overlapping genes with brain volumes. We tested the association of dopaminergic and circadian rhythm gene sets with ADHD, body mass index (BMI), and obesity (using GWAS data of N=53,293, N=681,275, and N=98,697, respectively). We then conducted genome-wide ADHD-BMI and ADHD-obesity gene-based meta-analyses, followed by pathway enrichment analyses. Finally, we tested the association of ADHD-BMI overlapping genes with brain volumes (primary GWAS data N=10,720-10,928; replication data N=9,428). The dopaminergic gene set was associated with both ADHD (P=5.81x10-3) and BMI (P=1.63x10-5), the circadian rhythm was associated with BMI (P=1.28x10-3). The genome-wide approach also implicated the dopaminergic system, as the Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP Signaling pathway was enriched in both ADHD-BMI and ADHD-obesity results. The ADHD-BMI overlapping genes were associated with putamen volume (P=7.7x10-3; replication data P=3.9x10-2) - a brain region with volumetric reductions in ADHD and BMI and linked to inhibitory control. Our findings suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission, partially through DARPP-32-dependent signaling and involving the putamen, is a key player underlying the genetic overlap between ADHD and obesity measures. Uncovering shared etiological factors underlying the frequently observed ADHD-obesity comorbidity may have important implications in terms of prevention and/or efficient treatment of these conditions.",

We analysed all male survivors <50 years not treated with steroids (N=60; median age 27 [interquartile range 24-31] years; median NISS 34 [29-44]). Urinary nitrogen excretion and muscle loss peaked after one and six weeks, respectively. Serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased immediately after trauma and took two, four and more than six months, respectively, to recover; opioid treatment delayed dehydroepiandrosterone recovery in a dose-dependent fashion. Androgens and precursors correlated with SOFA score and probability of sepsis.\n\nConclusionThe catabolic response to severe injury was accompanied by acute and sustained androgen suppression.

    "abstract": "Synaptic boutons are highly plastic structures undergoing experience-dependent changes in their number, volume, and shape. Their plasticity has been intensively studied in the insect mushroom bodies by manually counting the number of boutons in small regions of interest and extrapolating this number to the volume of the mushroom body neuropil.\n\nHere we extend this analysis to the synaptic bouton distribution within a larger subregion of the mushroom body olfactory neuropil of honey bees (Apis mellifera). This required the development of an automated method combining two-photon imaging with advanced image post-processing and multiple threshold segmentation. The method was first validated in subregions of the mushroom body olfactory and visual neuropils. Further analyses in the olfactory neuropil suggested that previous studies overestimated the number of synaptic boutons. As a reason for that, we identified boundaries effects in the small volume samples. The application of the automated analysis to larger volumes of the mushroom body olfactory neuropil revealed a corrected average density of synaptic boutons and, for the first time, their 3D spatial distribution. This distribution exhibited a considerable heterogeneity.\n\nThis additional information on the synaptic bouton distribution provides the basis for future studies on brain development, symmetry, and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Most research into bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) capacity for communication has centered on tonal calls termed whistles, in particular individually distinctive contact calls referred to as signature whistles. While \"non-signature\" whistles exist, and may be important components of bottlenose dolphins communicative repertoire, they have not been studied extensively. This is in part due to the difficulty of attributing whistles to specific individuals, a challenge that has limited the study of not only non-signature whistles but the study of general acoustic exchanges among socializing dolphins. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. We deliver estimated time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOAs) and normalized cross-correlation values computed from pairs of hydrophone signals to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models. In our 14-source-location setup, we achieve perfect accuracy in localization by classification and high accuracy in localization by regression (median absolute deviation of 0.66 m, interquartile range of 0.34 m - 1.57 m), with fewer than 10,000 features. By building a parsimonious (minimum-feature) classification tree model for the same task, we show that a minimally sufficient feature set is consistent with the information valued by a strictly geometric, time-difference-of-arrival-based approach to sound source localization. Ultimately, our regression models yielded better accuracy than the established Steered-Response Power (SRP) method when all training data were used, and comparable accuracy along the pool surface when deprived of training data at testing sites; our methods additionally boast improved computation time and the potential for superior localization accuracy in all dimensions with more training data.",

Here we developed a simple and effective algorithm for BSA-Seq data analysis and implemented it in Python, the program was named PyBSASeq. Using PyBSASeq, the likely trait-associated SNPs (ltaSNPs) were identified via Fishers exact test and then the ratio of the ltaSNPs to total SNPs in a chromosomal interval was used to identify the genomic regions that condition the trait of interest.

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning algorithms for decoding psychological constructs based on neural data is becoming increasingly popular. However, there is a need for methods that allow to interpret trained decoding models, as a step towards bridging the gap between theory-driven cognitive neuroscience and data-driven decoding approaches. The present study demonstrates grouped model reliance as a model-agnostic permutation-based approach to this problem. Grouped model reliance indicates the extent to which a trained model relies on conceptually related groups of variables, such as frequency bands or regions of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a case study to demonstrate the method, random forest and support vector machine models were trained on within-participant single-trial EEG data from a Sternberg working memory task. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of digits (0-9), varying randomly in length between one, four and seven digits, where EEG recordings for working memory load estimation were taken from a 3-second retention interval. Present results confirm previous findings in so far, as both random forest and support vector machine models relied on alpha-band activity in most subjects. However, as revealed by further analyses, patterns in frequency and particularly topography varied considerably between individuals, pointing to more pronounced inter-individual differences than reported previously.\n\nAuthor summaryModern machine learning algorithms currently receive considerable attention for their predictive power in neural decoding applications. However, there is a need for methods that make such predictive models interpretable. In the present work, we address the problem of assessing which aspects of the input data a trained model relies upon to make predictions. We demonstrate the use of grouped model-reliance as a generally applicable method for interpreting neural decoding models. Illustrating the method on a case study, we employed an experimental design in which a comparably small number of participants (10) completed a large number of trials (972) over multiple electroencephalography (EEG) recording sessions from a Sternberg working memory task. Trained decoding models consistently relied on alpha frequency activity, which is in line with existing research on the relationship between neural oscillations and working memory. However, our analyses also indicate large inter-individual variability with respect to the relation between activity patterns and working memory load in frequency and topography. Taken together, we argue that grouped model reliance provides a useful tool to better understand the workings of (sometimes otherwise black-box) decoding models.",

    "abstract": "Comparative studies aid in our understanding of specific conditions favoring the initial evolution of different types of social behaviors, yet there is much unexplained intraspecific variation in the expression of social behavior that comparative studies have not yet addressed. The proximate causes of this individual variation in social behavior within a species have been examined in some species but its fitness consequences have been less frequently investigated. In this study, we quantified the fitness consequences of variation in the sociality of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). We characterized sociality of voles in semi-natural enclosures using an automated behavioral tracking system paired with social network analyses to quantify the degree of spatial and temporal co-occurrence of different voles. We then assessed the relationship between sociality with mating success (number of different conspecifics with which an individual produced offspring) and reproductive success (total number of offspring surviving to first capture). We measured the number of social connections each individual had with all voles and only with opposite-sex voles by calculating unweighted degree through social network analyses. Both female and male voles varied in the number of social connections they had with all conspecifics and with opposite-sex conspecifics. Voles with an intermediate number of social connections with voles of both sexes had higher mating success overall. In our analyses that considered all social connections with voles of both sexes, voles with an intermediate number of social connections produced more offspring. Males with a very high or low number of social connections also had the lowest average body mass. Overall, our results suggest some limit on the fitness benefits of sociality. Although there was substantial individual-variation in our measure of vole social behavior, intermediate levels of social connections may be most favorable.",

However, it is difficult to practically make use of the relationship between sequence and phenotype due to the complex relationship between sequence and folding or activity.\n\nResultsHere, we predict the originating species optimal growth temperatures of individual protein sequences using trained machine learning models. Both multilayer perceptron and k Nearest Neighbor regression outperformed linear regression could predict the originating species optimal growth temperature from protein sequences, achieving a root mean squared error of 3.6 {degrees}C. Similar machine learning models could predict organismal optimal growth pH and oxygen tolerance, and the quantitative properties of individual proteins or nucleic acids.\n\nConclusionsUsing multilayer perceptron and k Nearest Neighbor regressions, we were able to build models specific to individual protein or nucleic acid families that can predict a variety of quantitative phenotypes. This methodology will be useful the in silico screening of individual mutations for particular properties, and also effective in the predicting the phenotypes of uncharacterized biological sequences and organisms.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary diversification of animals is one of Earths greatest triumphs, yet its origins are still shrouded in mystery. Animals, the monophyletic clade known as Metazoa, evolved wildly divergent multicellular life strategies featuring ciliated sensory epithelia. In many lineages epithelial sensoria became coupled to increasingly complex nervous systems. Currently, different phylogenetic analyses of single-copy genes support mutually-exclusive possibilities that either Porifera or Ctenophora is sister to all other animals. Resolving this dilemma would advance the ecological and evolutionary understanding of the first animals and the evolution of nervous systems. Here we describe a comparative phylogenetic approach based on gene duplications. We computationally identify and analyze gene families with early metazoan duplications using an approach that mitigates apparent gene loss resulting from the miscalling of paralogs. In the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family of mechano-transducing channels, we find ancient duplications that define separate clades for Eumetazoa (Placozoa + Cnidaria + Bilateria) versus Ctenophora, and one duplication that is shared only by Eumetazoa and Porifera. In the MLX/MLXIP family of bHLH-ZIP regulators of metabolism, we find that all major lineages from Eumetazoa and Porifera (sponges) share a duplication, absent in Ctenophora. These results suggest a new avenue for deducing deep phylogeny by choosing rather than avoiding ancient gene paralogies.",

    "abstract": "Mutations that a population accumulates during evolution in one (\"home\") environment may cause fitness gains or losses in other conditions. Such pleiotropic fitness effects determine the evolutionary fate of the population in variable environments and can lead to ecological specialization. It is unclear how the pleiotropic outcomes of evolution are shaped by the intrinsic randomness of the evolutionary process and by the deterministic variation in selection pressures across environments. To address this question, we evolved 20 replicate populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 11 laboratory environments and measured their fitness across multiple other conditions. We found that evolution in all home environments led to a diversity of patterns of pleiotropic fitness gains and losses, driven by multiple types of mutations. Approximately 60% percent of this variation are explained by clones home environment and the most common parallel genetic changes, while about 40% are attributed to the stochastic accumulation of mutations whose pleiotropic effects are unpredictable. On average, populations specialized to their home environment, but generalists also evolved in almost all conditions. Our results suggest that the mutations accumulating in a home environment incur a variety of pleiotropic effects, from costs to benefits, with different probabilities. Therefore, whether a population evolves towards a specialist or a generalist phenotype is heavily influenced by chance.",

    "abstract": "Animals need to remember the locations of nourishing and toxic food sources for survival, a fact that necessitates a mechanism for associating taste experiences with particular places. We have previously identified such responses within hippocampal place cells [1], the activity of which is thought to aid memory-guided behavior by forming a mental map of an animals environment that can be reshaped through experience [2-7]. It remains unknown, however, whether taste-responsiveness is intrinsic to a subset of place cells, or emerges as a result of experience that reorganizes spatial maps. Here, we recorded from neurons in the dorsal CA1 region of rats running for palatable tastes delivered via intra-oral cannulae at specific locations on a linear track. We identified a subset of taste-responsive cells that, even prior to taste exposure, had larger place fields than non-taste-responsive cells overlapping with stimulus delivery zones. Taste-responsive cells place fields then contracted, as a result of taste experience, leading to a stronger representation of stimulus delivery zones on the track. Taste-responsive units exhibited increased sharp-wave ripple co-activation during the taste delivery session and subsequent rest periods, which correlated with the degree of place field contraction. Our results reveal that novel taste experience evokes responses within a preconfigured network of taste-responsive hippocampal place cells with large fields, whose spatial representations are refined by sensory experience to signal areas of behavioral salience. This represents a possible mechanism by which animals identify and remember locations where ecologically relevant stimuli are found within their environment.",

Pairwise nucleotide comparison to three type strains within the genus Acinetobacter assigned LC510 as an Acinetobacter pittii isolate. Scanning of the LC510 genome identified two genes coding for {beta}-lactamase resistance, despite the fact that LC510 was isolated from a portion of the cave not previously visited by humans and protected from anthropogenic input.

    "abstract": "Numerous proteins are sumoylated in normally growing yeast and SUMO conjugation levels rise upon exposure to several stress conditions. We observe high levels of sumoylation also during early exponential growth and when nutrient-rich medium is used. However, we find that reduced sumoylation (~75% less than normal) is remarkably well-tolerated, with no apparent growth defects under non-stress conditions or under osmotic, oxidative, or ethanol stresses. In contrast, strains with reduced activity of Ubc9, the sole SUMO conjugase, are temperature-sensitive, implicating sumoylation in the heat stress response, specifically. Aligned with this, a mild heat shock triggers increased sumoylation which requires functional levels of Ubc9, but likely also depends on decreased desumoylation, since heat shock reduces protein levels of Ulp1, the major SUMO protease. Furthermore, we find that a ubc9 mutant strain with only ~5% of normal sumoylation levels shows a modest growth defect, has abnormal genomic distribution of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and displays a greatly expanded redistribution of RNAPII after heat shock. Together, our data implies that SUMO conjugations are largely dispensable under normal conditions, but a threshold level of Ubc9 activity is needed to maintain transcriptional control and to modulate the redistribution of RNAPII and promote survival when temperatures rise.",

    "abstract": "The identification of biomarkers or predictive features that are indicative of a specific biological or disease state is a major research topic in biomedical applications. Several feature selection(FS) methods ranging from simple univariate methods to recent deep-learning methods have been proposed to select a minimal set of the most predictive features. However, there still lacks the answer to the question of \"which method to use when\". In this paper, we study the performance of feature selection methods with respect to the underlying datasets statistics and their data complexity measures. We perform a comparative study of 11 feature selection methods over 27 publicly available datasets evaluated over a range of number of selected features using classification as the downstream task. We take the first step towards understanding the FS methods performance from the viewpoint of data complexity. Specifically, we (empirically) show that as regard to classification, the performance of all studied feature selection methods is highly correlated with the error rate of a nearest neighbor based classifier. We also argue about the non-suitability of studied complexity measures to determine the optimal number of relevant features. While looking closely at several other aspects, we also provide recommendations for choosing a particular FS method for a given dataset.",

The predictability of antibody-antigen binding is a prerequisite for de novo antibody and (neo-)epitope design. A fundamental premise for the predictability of antibody-antigen binding is the existence of paratope-epitope interaction motifs that are universally shared among antibody-antigen structures. In the largest set of non-redundant antibody-antigen structures, we identified structural interaction motifs, which together compose a commonly shared structure-based vocabulary of paratope-epitope interactions. We show that this vocabulary enables the machine learnability of antibody-antigen binding on the paratope-epitope level using generative machine learning. The vocabulary (i) is compact, less than 104 motifs, (ii) distinct from non-immune protein-protein interactions, and (iii) mediates specific oligo- and polyreactive interactions between paratope-epitope pairs. Our work successfully leveraged combined structure- and sequence-based learning showing that machine-learning-driven predictive paratope and epitope engineering is feasible.",

Human myometrial tissues from nonpregnant (NP) and term pregnant (TP) human subjects were examined by RNAseq, ATACseq and PGR ChIPseq assays to profile transcriptome, assessible genome and PGR occupancy. NP and TP specimens exhibit 2890 differentially expressed genes, reflecting an increase of metabolic, inflammatory and PDGF signaling, among others, in adaptation to pregnancy. At the epigenome level, patterns of accessible genome change between NP and TP myometrium, leading to altered enrichment of binding motifs for hormone and muscle regulators such as the progesterone receptor (PGR), Kruppel-like factors and MEF2A transcription factors. PGR genome occupancy exhibits a significant difference between the two stages of the myometrium, concomitant with distinct transcriptomic profiles including genes such as ENO1, LHDA, and PLCL1 in the glycolytic and calcium signaling pathways. Over-representation of SRF, MYOD and STAT binding motifs in PGR occupying sites further suggests interactions between PGR and major muscle regulators for myometrial gene expression. In conclusion, changes in accessible genome and PGR occupancy are part of the myometrial remodeling process and may serve as mechanisms to formulate the state-specific transcriptome profiles.",

The physiological responses of pear to cold-temperature-induced ripening have been well characterized, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon continue to be elucidated. This study employed established cold temperature conditioning treatments for ripening of two pear cultivars,  DAnjou and  Bartlett. Using a time-course transcriptomics approach, global gene expression responses of each cultivar were assessed at four different developmental stages during the cold conditioning process. Differential expression, functional annotation, and gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed. Interestingly, evidence for the involvement of cold-induced, vernalization-related genes and repressors of endodormancy release was found. These genes have not previously been described to play a role in fruit during the ripening transition. The resulting data provide insight into cultivar-specific mechanisms of cold-induced transcriptional regulation of ripening in European pear, as well as a unique comparative analysis of the two cultivars with very different cold conditioning requirements.",

The results suggest that over 30% of the population is the product of parents mating assortatively. The rest is probably the offspring of parents matching the genetic composition of their partners randomly. High degrees of genetic relatedness between parents, i.e. extreme inbreeding, was rare. This result shows that assortative mating is likely to be highly prevalent in human populations. Thus, assuming only random mating among humans, as widely done in ecology and population genetic studies, is not an appropriate approximation to reality. The existence of assortative mating has to be accounted for. The results suggest the conclusion that both, assortative and random mating, are evolutionary stable strategies. This improved insight allows to better understand complex evolutionary phenomena, such as the emergence and maintenance of sex, the speed of adaptation, runaway adaptation, maintenance of cooperation, and many others in human and animal populations.",

    "abstract": "1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) in an ethylene receptor antagonist which blocks ethylene perception and downstream ripening responses in climacteric fruit imparting a longer shelf life. However, in European pear, application of 1-MCP irreversibly obstructs the onset of system 2 ethylene production resulting in perpetually unripe fruit with undesirable quality. Application of exogenous ethylene, carbon dioxide and treatment to high temperatures is not able to reverse the blockage in ripening. We recently reported that during cold conditioning, activation of AOX occurs pre-climaterically. In this study we report that activation of AOX via exposure of 1-MCP treated  DAnjou pear fruit to glyoxylic acid triggers an accelerated ripening response. Ripening is consistently evident in decrease of fruit firmness and onset of S1-S2 ethylene transition. Time course ripening related measurements and transcriptomic analysis were performed to assess the effects of glyoxylic acid-driven stimulation of ripening. Transcriptomic and functional enrichment analyses revealed genes and ontologies implicated in glyoxylic acid mediated ripening, including alternative oxidase, TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, organic acid metabolism, and ethylene responsive pathways. These observations implicate the glyoxylate cycle as a metabolic hub linking multiple pathways to stimulate ripening through an alternate mechanism. The results provide information regarding how blockage caused by 1-MCP may be circumvented at the metabolic level, thus opening avenues for consistent ripening in pear and possibly other fruit.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe vertebrate retina consists of six major classes of neuronal cells. During development, these cells are generated from a pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that express the gene Vsx2. Fate-restricted RPCs have recently been identified, with limited mitotic potential and cell fate possibilities compared to multipotent RPCs. One population of fate-restricted RPCs, marked by activity of the regulatory element ThrbCRM1, gives rise to both cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells. These cells do not express Vsx2, but co-express the transcription factors (TFs) Onecut1 and Otx2, which bind to ThrbCRM1. The components of the gene regulatory networks that control the transition from multipotent to fate-restricted gene expression are not known. This work aims to identify and evaluate cis-regulatory elements proximal to Onecut1 to identify the gene regulatory networks involved in RPC fate-restriction.\n\nMethodWe identified regulatory elements through ATAC-seq and conservation, followed by reporter assays to screen for activity based on temporal and spatial criteria. The regulatory elements of interest were subject to deletion and mutation analysis to identify functional sequences and evaluated by quantitative flow cytometry assays. Finally, we combined the enhancer::reporter assays with candidate TF overexpression to evaluate the relationship between the TFs, the enhancers, and early vertebrate retinal development. Statistical tests included ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or unpaired t-tests.\n\nResultsTwo regulatory elements, ECR9 and ECR65, were identified to be active in ThrbCRM1(+) restricted RPCs. Candidate bHLH binding sites were identified as critical sequences in both elements. Overexpression of candidate bHLH TFs revealed specific enhancer-bHLH interactions. Nhlh1 overexpression expanded ECR65 activity into the Vsx2(+) RPC population, and overexpression of NeuroD1/NeuroG2/NeuroD4 had a similar effect on ECR9. Furthermore, bHLHs that were able to activate ectopic ECR9 reporter were able to induce endogenous Otx2 expression.\n\nConclusionsThis work reports a large-scale screen to identify spatiotemporally specific regulatory elements near the Onecut1 locus. These elements were used to identify distinct populations in the developing retina. In addition, fate-restricted regulatory elements responded differentially to bHLH factors, and suggest a role for retinal bHLHs upstream of the Otx2 and Onecut1 genes during the formation of restricted RPCs from multipotent RPCs.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is of growing public health concern due to the emergence of strains that are multidrug-resistant, virulent, or both. Taxonomically, Kp includes seven phylogroups, with Kp1 (K. pneumoniae sensu stricto) being medically prominent. Kp can be present in environmental sources such as soils and vegetation, which could act as reservoirs of animal and human infections. However, the current lack of screening methods to detect Kp in complex matrices limits research on Kp ecology. Here we analysed 4222 genome sequences and found that existing molecular detection targets lack specificity for Kp. A novel real-time PCR method, the ZKIR assay, was developed and used to detect Kp in 96 environmental samples. Results were compared to a culture-based method using SCAI agar medium coupled to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification. Whole-genome sequencing of environmental Kp was performed. The ZKIR assay was positive for the 48 tested Kp reference strains, whereas 88 non-Kp strains were negative. The limit of detection of Kp in spiked soil microcosms was 1.5 x 10-1 CFU g-1 after enrichment for 24 h in LB supplemented with ampicillin, and 1.5 x 103 to 1.5 x 104 CFU g-1 directly after soil DNA extraction. The ZKIR assay was more sensitive than the culture method. Kp was detected in 43% of environmental samples. Genomic analysis of the isolates revealed a predominance of phylogroups Kp1 (65%) and Kp3 (32%), a high genetic diversity (23 MLST sequence types), a quasi-absence of antibiotic resistance or virulence genes, and a high frequency (50%) of O-antigen type 3. This study shows that the ZKIR assay is an accurate, specific and sensitive novel method to detect the presence of Kp in complex matrices, and indicates that Kp isolates from environmental samples differ from clinical isolates.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (Kp) includes human and animal pathogens, some of which are emerging as hypervirulent and/or antibiotic resistant strains. These pathogens are diverse and classified into seven phylogroups, which may differ in their reservoirs and epidemiology. Proper management of this public health hazard requires a better understanding of Kp ecology and routes of transmission to humans. So far, detection of these microorganisms in complex matrices such as food or the environment has been difficult due to a lack of accurate and sensitive methods. Here, we describe a novel method based on real-time PCR, which enables detection of all Kp phylogroups with high sensitivity and specificity. We used this method to detect Kp isolates from environmental samples, and show based on genomic sequencing that they differ in antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene content, from human clinical Kp isolates. The ZKIR PCR assay will enable rapid screening of multiple samples for Kp presence and will thereby facilitate tracking the dispersal patterns of these pathogenic strains across environmental, food, animal and human sources.",

The mitochondrial genome maintenance and inheritance differ from nuclear genome, potentially uncoupling their evolutionary trajectories. Here, we analysed mitochondrial sequences obtained from the 1,011 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain collection and identified pronounced differences with their nuclear genome counterparts. In contrast with most fungal species, S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genomes show higher genetic diversity compared to the nuclear genomes. Strikingly, mitochondrial genomes appear to be highly admixed, resulting in a complex interconnected phylogeny with weak grouping of isolates, whereas interspecies introgressions are very rare. Complete genome assemblies revealed that structural rearrangements are nearly absent with rare inversions detected. We tracked introns variation in COX1 and COB to infer gain and loss events throughout the species evolutionary history. Mitochondrial genome copy number is connected with the nuclear genome and linearly scale up with ploidy. We observed rare cases of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA loss, petite, with a subset of them that do not suffer fitness growth defects. Overall, our results illustrate how differences in the biology of two genomes coexisting in the same cells can lead to discordant evolutionary histories.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica is a foodborne pathogen leading to gastroenteritis and is commonly acquired by consumption of contaminated food of animal origin. However, numbers of outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh or minimally processed food of non-animal origin are increasing. New infection routes of S. enterica by vegetables, fruits, nuts and herbs have to be considered. This leads to special interest in S. enterica interactions with leafy products, e.g. salads, that are consumed unprocessed. The attachment of S. enterica to salad is a crucial step in contamination, but little is known about the bacterial factors required and mechanisms of adhesion. S. enterica possesses a complex set of adhesive structures whose functions are only partly understood. Potentially, S. enterica may deploy multiple adhesive strategies for adhering to various salad species, and other vegetables. Here, we systematically analyzed the contribution of the complete adhesiome, of LPS, and of flagella-mediated motility of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) in adhesion to corn salad. We deployed a reductionist, synthetic approach to identify factors involved in the surface binding of STM to leaves of corn salad with particular regard to the expression of all known adhesive structures using the Tet-on system. This work reveals the contribution of Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system-secreted BapA, an intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility of STM in adhesion to corn salad leaves.\n\nImportance\n\nHuman gastrointestinal pathogens are often transmitted by animal products, but recent outbreaks show increasing importance of vegetables as source of infection by pathogenic E. coli or Salmonella enterica. The mechanisms of binding of S. enterica to vegetables such as salad are only poorly understood. We established an experimental model system to systematically investigate the role of adhesive structures of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in binding to corn salad leaves. The contributions of all members of the complex adhesiome, flagella, and O-antigen were evaluated. We identified that Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system-secreted BapA, an intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility contribute to adhesion of Salmonella to corn salad leaves. These results will enable future investigations on factors contributing to contamination of vegetables under agricultural conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPeel degreening is an important aspect of fruit ripening in many citrus fruit, and earlier studies have shown that it can be advanced either by ethylene treatment or during low temperature storage. However, the important regulators and pathways involved in natural peel degreening remain largely unknown. To understand how natural peel degreening is regulated in lemon (Citrus limon L.) fruit, flavedo transcriptome and physiochemical changes in response to either ethylene treatment or low temperature were studied. Ethylene treatment induced rapid peel degreening which was strongly inhibited by the ethylene antagonist, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Compared with 25{degrees}C, moderately low temperatures (5{degrees}C, 10{degrees}C, 15{degrees}C and 20{degrees}C) also triggered peel degreening. Surprisingly, repeated 1-MCP treatments failed to inhibit the peel degreening induced by low temperature. Transcriptome analysis revealed that low temperature and ethylene independently regulated genes associated with chlorophyll degradation, carotenoid metabolism, photosystem proteins, phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling, and transcription factors. On-tree peel degreening occurred along with environmental temperature drops, and it coincided with the differential expression of low temperature-regulated genes. In contrast, genes that were uniquely regulated by ethylene showed no significant expression changes during on-tree peel degreening. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that low temperature plays a prominent role in regulating natural peel degreening independently of ethylene in citrus fruit.\n\nHighlightCitrus peel degreening is promoted by low temperature via modulation of multiple genes associated with chlorophyll degradation, carotenoid biosynthesis, photosystem disassembly, phytohormones and transcription factors without involving ethylene signalling.",

    "abstract": "The number of culture-independent indoor microbiome study has increased remarkably in recent years, but microbial composition among different sampling strategies remains poorly characterized and their impact to downstream microbiome analysis is also not clear. In this study, we reported a case study of microbial composition of floor and air dust in 87 dormitory rooms of Shanxi University, China. Floor and air dust were collected by vacuum cleaner and petri-dish, respectively, and the bacterial composition was characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing. The composition of floor and air dust differed significantly (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.001, Adonis), and Pseudomonas dominated in floor dust (75.1%) but was less common in air dust (1.9%). The top genera in air dust, including Ralstonia (15.6%), Pelomonas (11.3%), Anoxybacillus (9.3%) and Ochrobactrum (6.2%), all accounted for < 1% abundance in floor dust. The dominant Pseudomonas in floor dust swamped low frequency organisms, leading to significant lower number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compared with air dust in the same sequencing depth. The different microbial composition of floor and air dust can lead to differences in downstream bioinformatics analyses. We searched the dormitory microbiome against ~200,000 samples deposited in Microbiome Search Engine (MSE), and found that the compositions of floor dust samples were similar to samples from building environment and human nasopharynx, whereas the compositions of the air dust samples were similar to mosquito tissues.\n\nImportanceIncreasing number of indoor microbiome studies has been conducted in recent years, but the impact of sampling strategy is far from clear. In this study, we reported that the floor and air sampling can lead to drastic variation in microbial composition and downstream analyses in university dormitories, including microbial diversity estimation and compositional similarity search. Thus, the bioinformatics analysis results need to be interpreted with caution in microbiome studies, and it may be necessary to collected samples from different sampling strategies to comprehensively characterize the microbial composition and exposure to human occupants in an indoor environment.",

Here, we describe the 2.6 [A] structure of a CLC mutant designed to mimic the fully H+-loaded transporter. This structure reveals a global conformational change to a state that has improved accessibility for the Cl- substrate from the extracellular side and new conformations for two key glutamate residues.

This phenotype is also observed in plants with reduced levels of miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, suggesting that AMP1 may promote SPL activity. However, we found that the amp1 phenotype is only partially corrected by elevated SPL gene expression, and that amp1 has no significant effect on SPL transcript levels, or on the level or the activity of miR156. Although evidence from a previous study suggests that AMP1 promotes miRNA-mediated translational repression, amp1 did not prevent the translational repression of the miR156 target, SPL9, or the miR159 target, MYB33.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMSTight junctions (TJs) establish tissue barriers that maintain osmotic homeostasis and, in the liver, isolate bile flow from the blood circulation. ZO-2/Tjp2 is a scaffold protein that tethers TJ transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Missense mutations in Tjp2 have recently been shown to cause progressive cholestatic liver disease in humans. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. To study the role of Tjp2 in cholestatic liver disease, we generated and characterized mice lacking Tjp2 in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, or both.\n\nMETHODSTjp2 was inactivated in the mouse liver (both in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) or hepatocytes or cholangiocytes only. Liver function tests were carried out by biochemical analysis of plasma and liver samples and liver tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and histology. The mice were also subjected to cholic acid (CA) diet to assess their susceptibility to liver insults.\n\nRESULTSDeletion of Tjp2 in the mouse liver did not result in apparent changes in TJ structure and composition, but lead to progressive cholestasis with lower expression levels of the bile acid (BA) transporter ABCB11/Bsep and the detoxification enzyme Cyp2b10. Feeding a CA diet that is well tolerated by control mice caused severe cholestasis and necrotic liver injury in mice lacking hepatic Tjp2. Administration of a CAR agonist, TCPOBOP, protected these mice from CA induced injury by enhancing the expression of the detoxifying enzyme Cyp2b10 in hepatocytes. Mice lacking Tjp2 in only hepatocytes or in only cholangiocytes showed less severe CA diet induced liver injury.\n\nCONCLUSIONLoss of Tjp2 from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes both contribute to progressive cholestatic liver disease and higher susceptibility to liver injury. In hepatocytes, Tjp2 exerts a protective role by regulating expression levels of BA transporters and detoxification enzymes. The mice may provide a new animal model for cholestatic liver disease linked to Tjp2 mutations in humans.",

    "abstract": "Insect navigation arises from the coordinated action of concurrent guidance systems but the neural mechanisms through which each functions, and are then coordinated, remains unknown. We propose that insects require distinct strategies to retrace familiar routes (route-following) and directly return from novel to familiar terrain (homing) using different aspects of frequency encoded views that are processed in different neural pathways. We also demonstrate how the Central Complex and Mushroom Bodies regions of the insect brain may work in tandem to coordinate the directional output of different guidance cues through a contextually switched ring-attractor inspired by neural recordings. The resultant unified model of insect navigation reproduces behavioural data from a series of cue conflict experiments in realistic animal environments and offers testable hypotheses of where and how insects process visual cues, utilise the different information that they provide and coordinate their outputs to achieve the adaptive behaviours observed in the wild.",

    "abstract": "The signalling pathways underpinning cell growth and invasion use overlapping components, yet how mutually exclusive cellular responses occur is unclear. We developed 3-Dimensional culture analyses to separately quantify growth and invasion. We identify that alternate variants of IQSEC1, an ARF GTPase Exchange Factor, act as switches to promote invasion over growth by spatially enriching cortical phosphoinositide metabolism. All IQSEC1 variants activate ARF5- and ARF6-dependent PIP5-kinase to promote PI(3,4,5)P3-AKT signalling and growth. In contrast, select pro-invasive IQSEC1 variants restrict PI(3,4,5)P3 production to discrete cortical domains to form invasion-driving protrusions. Inhibition of IQSEC1 attenuates invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Induction of pro-invasive IQSEC1 variants and elevated IQSEC1 expression occurs in a number of tumour types and is associated with higher-grade metastatic cancer, activation of PIP3-signalling, and predicts long-term poor outcome across multiple cancers. Spatial enrichment of phosphoinositide metabolism therefore is a switch to induce invasion over growth in response to the same external signal. Targeting IQSEC1 as the central regulator of this switch may represent a therapeutic vulnerability to stop metastasis.\n\nHighlightsO_LISpatial enrichment of PI(3,4,5)P3 is a molecular switch to promote invasion.\nC_LIO_LIIQSEC1 is a GEF for ARF5/6, promoting PIP5K-dependent PI(3,4,5)P3 production downstream of the HGF receptor Met.\nC_LIO_LIPro-invasive IQSEC1 variants restrict cortical PI(3,4,5)P3 production to subdomains that convert into invasive protrusions.\nC_LIO_LIIQSEC1 inhibition attenuates in vitro invasion and metastasis in vivo.\nC_LIO_LIIQSEC1 module is associated with poor outcome across tumour types.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Relative resistance to apoptosis and the ability to proliferate and produce a collagen-rich scar determine the critical role of cardiac fibroblasts in wound healing and tissue remodeling following myocardial injury. Identification of cardiac fibroblast-specific factors and mechanisms underlying these aspects of cardiac fibroblast function is therefore of considerable scientific and clinical interest. In the present study, gene knockdown and over-expression approaches, and promoter binding assays, showed that DDR2, a mesenchymal cell-specific collagen receptor tyrosine kinase localized predominantly in fibroblasts in the heart, acts via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF transcription factor to enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic cIAP2 in cardiac fibroblasts, conferring resistance against oxidative injury.\n\nFurther, DDR2 was found to act via ERK1/2 MAPK-activated SRF to transcriptionally up regulate Skp2 that in turn facilitated post-translational degradation of p27, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that causes cell cycle arrest, to promote G1-S transition, as evidenced by Rb phosphorylation, increased PCNA levels and flow cytometry. DDR2-dependent ERK1/2 MAPK activation also suppressed FoxO3a-mediated transcriptional induction of p27. Inhibition of the binding of collagen type I to DDR2 using WRG-28 indicated the obligate role of collagen type I in the activation of DDR2 and its regulatory role in cell survival and cell cycle protein expression. Notably, DDR2 levels positively correlated with SRF, cIAP2 and PCNA levels in cardiac fibroblasts from Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. To conclude, DDR2-mediated ERK1/2MAPK activation facilitates coordinated regulation of cell survival and cell cycle progression in cardiac fibroblasts via SRF.\n\nNew & NoteworthyRelative resistance to apoptosis and the ability to proliferate and produce a collagen-rich scar enable cardiac fibroblasts to play a central role in myocardial response to injury. This study reports novel findings that mitogen-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts exploit a common regulatory mechanism involving collagen receptor (DDR2)-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and SRF to achieve coordinated regulation of apoptosis resistance and cell cycle progression, which could facilitate their survival and function in the injured myocardium.",

Yet we lack a complete, realistic account of either. Building on control engineering, we introduce a new model for decision making in the brain that reuses a temporally abstracted map of future events to enable biologically-realistic, flexible choice at the expense of specific, quantifiable biases. It replaces the classic nonlinear, model-based optimization with a linear approximation that softly maximizes around (and is weakly biased toward) a default policy. This solution exposes connections between seemingly disparate phenomena across behavioral neuroscience, notably flexible replanning with biases and cognitive control. It also gives new insight into how the brain can represent maps of long-distance contingencies stably and componentially, as in entorhinal response fields, and exploit them to guide choice even under changing goals.",

Two cowpea varieties, 603 and the salt-tolerant CB 46, were each inoculated with four different native soil samples, and data showed that plants inoculated with soil samples SS-2 and SS-4 grew better than plants inoculated with soil samples SS-1 and SS-3. Bacteria were isolated from both soils and nodules, and 34 of the 51 original isolates tested positive for PGPR traits in plate assays with many exhibiting multiple plant growth-promoting properties. A number of isolates were positive for all PGPR traits tested. For the microbiome studies, environmental DNA (eDNA) was isolated from SS-1 and SS-4, which represented the extremes of the Pakistan soils to which the plants responded, and by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were found to consist mainly of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. However, sequencing analysis of eDNA isolated from cowpea nodules established by the trap plants grown in the four Pakistan soils indicated that the nodule microbiome consisted almost exclusively of Proteobacterial sequences, particularly Bradyrhizobium. Yet, many other bacteria including Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Pseudomonas, as well as Paenibacillus, Bacillus as well as non-proteobacterial genera were isolated from the nodules of soil-inoculated cowpea plants. This discrepancy between the bacteria isolated from cowpea nodules (Proteobacteria and non-Proteobacteria) versus those detected in the nodule microbiome (Proteobacteria) needs further study.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapies are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics with many potential applications. Ewing Sarcoma patients could benefit dramatically from personalized miRNA therapy due to inter-patient heterogeneity and a lack of druggable (to this point) targets. However, because of the broad effects miRNAs may have on different cells and tissues, trials of miRNA therapies have struggled due to severe toxicity and unanticipated immune response. In order to overcome this hurdle, a network science-based approach is well-equipped to evaluate and identify miRNA candidates and combinations of candidates for the repression of key oncogenic targets while avoiding repression of essential housekeeping genes. We first characterized 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines using mRNA sequencing. We then estimated a measure of tumor state, which we term network potential, based on both the mRNA gene expression and the underlying protein-protein interaction network in the tumor. Next, we ranked mRNA targets based on their contribution to network potential. We then identified miRNAs and combinations of miRNAs that preferentially act to repress mRNA targets with the greatest influence on network potential. Our analysis identified TRIM25, APP, ELAV1, RNF4, and HNRNPL as ideal mRNA targets for Ewing sarcoma therapy. Using predicted miRNA-mRNA target mappings, we identified miR-3613-3p, let-7a-3p, miR-300, miR-424-5p, and let-7b-3p as candidate optimal miRNAs for preferential repression of these targets. Ultimately, our work, as exemplified in the case of Ewing sarcoma, describes a novel pipeline by which personalized miRNA cocktails can be designed to maximally perturb gene networks contributing to cancer progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrecision medicine in cancer aims to find the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time. Substantial variation between patient tumors, even of the same disease site, has limited the application of precision medicine in the clinic. In this study, we present novel computational tools for the identification of targets for cancer therapy using widely available sequencing data. We used a network-science based approach that leveraged multiple types of omic data to identify functionally relevant disease targets. Further, we developed algorithms to identify potential miRNA-based therapies that inhibit these predicted disease targets. We applied this pipeline to a novel Ewing Sarcoma transcriptomics data-set as well as publicly available patient data from the St. Jude Cloud. We identified a number of promising therapeutic targets for this rare disease, including EWSR1, the proposed driver of Ewing Sarcoma development. These novel data and methods will provide researchers with new tools for the development of precision medicine treatments in a variety of cancer systems.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe arrival of novel predators can trigger trophic cascades driven by shifts in prey numbers. Predators also elicit behavioural change in prey populations, via phenotypic plasticity and/or rapid evolution, and such changes may also contribute to trophic cascades. Here we document rapid demographic and behavioural changes in populations of a prey species (grassland melomys Melomys burtoni, a granivorous rodent) following the introduction of a novel marsupial predator (northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus). Within months of quolls appearing, populations of melomys exhibited reduced survival and population declines relative to control populations. Quoll-invaded populations (n = 4) were also significantly shyer than nearby, quoll-free populations (n = 3) of conspecifics. This rapid but generalised response to a novel threat was replaced over the following two years with more threat-specific antipredator behaviours (i.e. predator-scent aversion). Predator-exposed populations, however, remained more neophobic than predator-free populations throughout the study. These behavioural responses manifested rapidly in avoidance of seeds associated with quoll scent, with discrimination playing out over a spatial scale of tens of metres. Presumably the significant and novel predation pressure induced by quolls drove melomys populations to fine-tune behavioural responses to be more predator-specific through time. These behavioural shifts could reflect individual plasticity (phenotypic flexibility) in behaviour or may be adaptive shifts from natural selection imposed by quoll predation. Our study provides a rare insight into the rapid ecological and behavioural shifts enacted by prey to mitigate the impacts of a novel predator and shows that trophic cascades can be strongly influenced by behavioural changed rates of seed predation by melomys across treatments. Quoll-invaded melomys populations exhibited lower per-capita seed take rates, and rapidly developed an as well as numerical responses.",

Through whole-genome sequencing of 13 melanoma metastases sampled at autopsy from a treatment naive patient and by leveraging the analytical power of multi-sample analyses, we reveal that metastatic cells may depart the primary tumour very early in the disease course and follow a branched pattern of evolution. Truncal UV-induced mutations that often swamp downstream analyses of heterogeneity, were found to be replaced by APOBEC-associated mutations in the branches of the evolutionary tree. Multi-sample analyses from a further 7 patients confirmed that branched evolution was pervasive, representing an important mode of melanoma dissemination. Our analyses illustrate that combining cancer cell fraction estimates across multiple metastases provides higher resolution phylogenetic reconstructions relative to single sample analyses and highlights the limitations of accurately inferring inter-tumoural heterogeneity from a single biopsy.",

By contrast, it is abrogated in flies mutant for the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor Relish. Analysis of the transcriptome of 23-cGAMP injected flies reveals a complex pattern of response, with early and late induced genes.

    "abstract": "Shigella species cause diarrheal disease globally. Shigellosis is typically characterized by bloody stools and colitis with mucosal damage and is the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death worldwide. Following oral ingestion, the pathogen invades and replicates within the colonic epithelium through mechanisms that rely on its type III secretion system (T3SS). Currently, oral infection-based small animal models to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis are lacking. Here, we found that oro-gastric inoculation of infant rabbits with S. flexneri resulted in diarrhea and colonic pathology resembling that found in human shigellosis. Fasting animals prior to S. flexneri inoculation increased the frequency of disease. The pathogen colonized the colon, where both luminal and intraepithelial foci were observed. The intraepithelial foci likely arise through S. flexneri spreading from cell-to-cell. Robust S. flexneri intestinal colonization, invasion of the colonic epithelium, and epithelial sloughing all required the T3SS as well as IcsA, a factor required for bacterial spreading and adhesion in vitro. Expression of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8, detected with in situ mRNA labeling, was higher in animals infected with wild-type S. flexneri versus mutant strains deficient in icsA or T3SS, suggesting that epithelial invasion promotes expression of this chemokine. Collectively, our findings suggest that oral infection of infant rabbits offers a useful experimental model for studies of the pathogenesis of shigellosis and for testing of new therapeutics.\n\nImportanceShigella species are the leading bacterial cause of diarrheal death globally. The pathogen causes bacillary dysentery, a bloody diarrheal disease characterized by damage to the colonic mucosa and is usually spread through the fecal-oral route. Small animal models of shigellosis that rely on the oral route of infection are lacking. Here, we found that oro-gastric inoculation of infant rabbits with S. flexneri led to a diarrheal disease and colonic pathology reminiscent of human shigellosis. Diarrhea, intestinal colonization and pathology in this model were dependent on the S. flexneri type III secretion system and IcsA, canonical Shigella virulence factors. Thus, oral infection of infant rabbits offers a feasible model to study the pathogenesis of shigellosis and to develop and test new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher correct rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports the compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.",

    "abstract": "Given current clinical interest in vagus nerve stimulation, there are surprisingly few studies characterizing the anatomy of the vagus nerve in large animal models as it pertains to on-and off-target engagement of local fibers. We sought to address this gap by evaluating vagal anatomy in the domestic pig, whose vagus nerve organization and size approximates the human cervical vagus nerve. We provide data on key features across the cervical vagus nerve including diameter, number and diameter of fascicles, and distance of fascicles from the epineural surface where stimulating electrodes are placed. We also characterized the relative locations of the superior and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve that have been implicated in therapy limiting side effects with common electrode placement. We identified key variants across the cohort that may be important for vagus nerve stimulation with respect to changing sympathetic/parasympathetic tone, such as cross-connections to the sympathetic trunk. We discovered that cell bodies of pseudo-unipolar cells aggregate together to form a very distinct grouping within the nodose ganglion. This distinct grouping gives rise to a larger number of smaller fascicles as one moves caudally down the cervical vagus nerve. This often leads to a distinct bimodal organization, or  vagotopy that may be advantageous to exploit in design of electrodes/stimulation paradigms. Finally, we placed our data in context of historic and recent histology spanning mouse, rat, canine, pig, non-human primate and human models, thus providing a comprehensive resource to understand similarities and differences across species.",

    "abstract": "We applied three 16S rRNA sequencing protocols on vaginal microbiome samples, to evaluate whether they produce unbiased estimation of vaginal microbiome composition. We modified the 27F primer (hereafter denoted as 27F). Using vaginal samples from 28 healthy women and 10 women with bacterial vaginosis, we sequenced three 16S rRNA sequencing protocols, i.e., 27F-338R, 27F-338R and 341F-806R protocols, naming after their PCR primer sets, to test whether the sequencing results are consistent with the clinical diagnostics, morphology and qPCR results. First, the 27F primer would not align with Gardnerlla vaginalis very well, leading to poor amplification of such species. By modifying the primer sequences, the modified 27F primer (27F) was able to amplify Gardnerlla vaginalis very well. Second, the DNA sequence of characteristic species Lactobacillus crispatus is identical with Lactobacillus garrinarum, leading to biased estimation of abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus when using V3-V4 as PCR target region; in contrast, such bias did not occur when using V1-V2 as a target region. Third, optimized 27F-338R avoided above-mentioned biases and restored the well-established community state types (CSTs) clustering.\n\nImportanceVaginal microbiome has profound effects on the health of women and their newborns. Our study found that two well-established 16S rDNA sequencing protocols led to systementical biased estimation of characteristic species of vaginal microbiome. Subsequent analysis proved that the PCR primer fetching efficacy and target region identity were major contributor for such bias. With carefully selected target region and optimized PCR primer set, we were able to eliminate such biases and provide accurate estimation of vaginal microbiome, which showed high consistency with clinical diagnostics. We modified the 27F primer (27F). Using the optimized PCR primer set of 27F and 338R to target the V1-V2 hyper-variable region, our 16S rRNA sequencing correctly evaluate the composition of vaginal microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Social connection is critical to well-being, yet how the brain reflects our attachment to other people remains largely unknown. We combined univariate and multivariate brain imaging analyses to assess whether and how the brain organizes representations of others based on how connected they are to our own identity. During an fMRI scan, participants (N=43) completed a self- and other-reflection task for 16 targets: the self, five close others, five acquaintances, and five celebrities. In addition, they reported their subjective closeness to each target and their own trait loneliness. We examined neural responses to the self and others in a brain region that has been associated with self-representation (medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) and across the whole brain. The structure of self-other representation in the MPFC and across the social brain appeared to cluster targets into three social categories: the self, social network members (including close others and acquaintances), and celebrities. Moreover, both univariate activation in MPFC and multivariate self-other similarity in MPFC and across the social brain increased with subjective self-other closeness ratings. Critically, participants who were less socially connected (i.e. lonelier) showed altered self-other mapping in social brain regions. Most notably, in MPFC, loneliness was associated with reduced representational similarity between the self and others. The social brain apparently maintains information about broad social categories as well as closeness to the self. Moreover, these results point to the possibility that feelings of chronic social disconnection may be mirrored by a  lonelier neural self-representation.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial connection is critical to well-being, yet how the brain reflects our attachment to people remains unclear. We found that the social brain stratifies neural representations of people based on our subjective connection to them, separately clustering people who are and are not in our social network. Moreover, the people we feel closest to are represented most closely to ourselves. Finally, lonelier individuals also appeared to have a  lonelier neural self-representation in the MPFC, as loneliness attenuated the closeness between self and other neural representations in this region. The social brain appears to map our interpersonal ties, and alterations in this map may help explain why lonely individuals endorse statements such as  people are around me but not with me.",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of radiomics, which consists of transforming standard-of-care images to quantifiable scalar statistics, endeavors to reveal the information hidden in these macroscopic images. This field of research has found different applications ranging from phenotyping and tumor classification to outcome prediction and treatment planning. Texture analysis, which often consists of reducing spatial texture matrices to summary scalar features, has been shown to be important in many of the latter applications. However, as pointed out in many studies, some of the derived texture statistics are strongly correlated and tend to contribute redundant information; and are also sensitive to the parameters used in their computation, e.g., the number of gray intensity levels. In the present study, we propose first to consider texture matrices, with an emphasis on gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), as a non-parametric multivariate objects. The proposed modeling approach avoids evaluating redundant and strongly correlated features and also prevents the feature processing steps. Then, via the Wasserstein distance from optimal mass transport theory, we propose to compare these spatial objects to identify computerized tomography slices with dental artifacts in head and neck cancer. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed classification approach with respect to the GLCM extraction parameters and the size of the training set. Comparisons with the random forest classifier, which is constructed on scalar texture features, demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

Since the emergence of artemisinin resistance in the late 2000s in Cambodia, research into the underlying mechanisms has been underway.\n\nThe 2019 Malaria Dream Challenge posited the task of developing computational models that address important problems in advancing the fight against malaria. The first goal was to accurately predict Artemisinin drug resistance levels of Plasmodium falciparum isolates, as quantified by the IC50. The second goal was to predict the parasite clearance rate of malaria parasite isolates based on in vitro transcriptional profiles.\n\nIn this work, we develop machine learning models using novel methods for transforming isolate data and handling the tens of thousands of variables that result from these data transformation exercises. This is demonstrated by using massively parallel processing of the data vectorization for use in scalable machine learning. In addition, we show the utility of ensemble machine learning modeling for highly effective predictions of both goals of this challenge. This is demonstrated by the use of multiple machine learning algorithms combined with various scaling and normalization preprocessing steps. Then, using a voting ensemble, multiple models are combined to generate a final model prediction.",

For all the protein forms, denaturation/renaturation kinetic curves at different urea concentrations were obtained, folding/unfolding constants were calculated and dependencies of rate constant logarithms on urea concentrations were plotted. All the data gave an opportunity to calculate free energies of different apomyoglobin states.

    "abstract": "In logical reasoning, difficulties in inhibition of currently-held beliefs may lead to unwarranted conclusions, known as belief bias. Aging is associated with difficulties in inhibitory control, which may lead to deficits in inhibition of currently-held beliefs. No study to date, however, has investigated the underlying neural substrates of age-related differences in logical reasoning and the impact of belief load. The aim of the present study was to delineate age differences in brain activity during a syllogistic logical reasoning task while the believability load of logical inferences was manipulated. Twenty-nine, healthy, younger and thirty, healthy, older adults (males and females) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they were asked to determine the logical validity of conclusions. Unlike younger adults, older adults engaged a large-scale network including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during conclusion stage. Our functional connectivity results suggest that while older adults engaged the ACC network to overcome their intuitive responses for believable inferences, the IFG network contributed to higher control over responses during both believable and unbelievable conditions. Our functional results were further supported by structure-function-behavior analyses indicating the importance of cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus integrity in rejection of believable statements. These novel findings lend evidence for age-related differences in belief bias, with potentially important implications for decision making where currently-held beliefs and given assumptions are in conflict.",

    "abstract": "RBM45 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein (RBP) found in cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimers disease (AD). While cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions contain other disease-associated proteins, nuclear RBM45 inclusions are morphologically and biochemically distinct from previously described nuclear inclusion pathology in these diseases. To better understand nuclear RBM45 aggregation and inclusion formation, we evaluated the association of RBM45 with a variety of membraneless nuclear organelles, including nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, and nuclear gems. Under basal conditions, RBM45 is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and does not localize to a specific nuclear organelle. During cellular stress, however, the nuclear RBM45 distribution undergoes an RNA-binding dependent rearrangement wherein RBM45 coalesces into a small number of nuclear puncta. These puncta contain the nuclear stress body (NSB) markers heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB). During chronic stress, the persistent association of RBM45 with NSBs leads to the formation of large, insoluble nuclear RBM45 inclusions. RBM45 nuclear inclusions persist after stressor removal and NSB disassembly and the inclusions resemble the nuclear RBM45 pathology seen in ALS, FTLD, and AD. We also quantified the cell type- and disease-specific patterns of RBM45 pathology in ALS, FTLD, AD, and non-neurologic disease control subjects. RBM45 nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are found in neurons and glia in ALS, FTLD, and AD but not in controls. Across diseases, RBM45 nuclear inclusion pathology occurs more frequently than cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusion pathology and exhibits cell type-specific variation. Collectively, our results define new stress-associated functions of RBM45, a mechanism for its nuclear aggregation and inclusion formation, a role for NSBs in the pathogenesis of diseases such as ALS, FTLD, and AD, and further underscore the importance of self-association to both the normal and pathological functions of RBPs in these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Host and parasite richness are generally positively correlated, but the stability of this relationship during community assembly remains untested. The composition of host communities can alter parasite transmission, and the relationship between host and parasite richness is sensitive to parasite transmission. Thus, changes in composition during host community assembly could strengthen or weaken the relationship between host and parasite richness. Host community assembly, in turn, can be driven by many processes, including resource enrichment. To test the hypothesis that host community assembly can alter the relationship between host and parasite richness, we experimentally crossed host diversity and resource supply to hosts, then allowed communities to assemble. As previously shown, initial host diversity and resource supply determined the trajectory of host community assembly, altering post-assembly host species richness, richness-independent host phylogenetic diversity, and colonization by exotic host species. Throughout community assembly, host richness predicted parasite richness. As predicted, this effect was moderated by exotic abundance: communities dominated by exotic species exhibited a stronger positive relationship between post-assembly host and parasite richness. Ultimately, these results suggest that, by modulating parasite transmission, community assembly can modify the relationship between host and parasite richness, providing a novel mechanism to explain contingencies in this relationship.",

Among these higher-level functions, conversion of organic matter into simpler building blocks by microbial communities underpins biogeochemical cycles and animal and plant nutrition, and is exploited in biotechnology. A prerequisite to predicting the dynamics and stability of community-mediated metabolic conversions, is the development and calibration of appropriate mathematical models. Here, we present a generic, extendable thermodynamic model for community dynamics accounting explicitly for metabolic activities of composing microbes, system pH, and chemical exchanges. We calibrate a key parameter of this thermodynamic model, the minimum energy requirement associated with growth-supporting metabolic pathways, using experimental population dynamics data from synthetic communities composed of a sulfate reducer and two methanogens. Our findings show that accounting for thermodynamics is necessary in capturing experimental population dynamics of these synthetic communities that feature relevant species utilising low-energy growth pathways. Furthermore, they provide the first estimates for minimum energy requirements of methanogenesis and elaborates on previous estimates of lactate fermentation by sulfate reducers. The open-source nature of the developed model and demonstration of its use for estimating a key thermodynamic parameter should facilitate further thermodynamic modelling of microbial communities.",

Here we show that groups of four isogenic male mice rapidly form enduring social ranks in a dominance hierarchy. Highest ranked individuals display enhanced anxiety and working memory, are more social and more susceptible to stress-related maladaptive behaviours. Are these differences causes or consequences to social life? We show that anxiety emerges from life in colony whereas sociability is a pre-existing trait. Strikingly, highest ranked individuals exhibit lower bursting activity of VTA dopamine neurons. Both pharmacogenetic inhibition of this neuronal population and the genetic inactivation of glucocorticoid receptor signalling in dopamine-sensing brain areas promote the accession to higher social ranks. Altogether, these results indicate that the shaping of social fate relies upon the interplay of dopamine system and stress response, impacting individual behaviour and potentially mental health.",

    "abstract": "In northeast Asia, substantial portion of the floras, including endangered species, are shared among its component countries in the continental, peninsula, and island parts largely through Quaternary migration. To effectively conserve nationally endangered plants in Northeast Asia, transnational conservation studies are vitally needed. Lychnis wilfordii (Caryophyllaceae) has disjunct distribution in Russian Far East (Primorsky Krai), northeast China (Jilin), Korea (Gangwon-do) and Japan (Hokkaido, Aomori, Nagano), surrounding the sea, and this is designated as an endangered species in Japan and Korea. Population genetic and molecular dating analyses were conducted 1) to elucidate geographic genetic structure covering the species range, 2) to test possible scenarios of migration, and 3) to develop logical plans for effective conservation. Population genetic analyses indicated the continent and peninsula parts (north and south Primorsky Krai, Jilin, and Gangwon-do) had higher genetic diversity compared to those in the Japanese Archipelago (Hokkaido and Nagano). Five genetically distinct groups were recognized, namely, Nagano, Gangwon-do, Jilin, north and south Primorsky Krai plus Aomori, and Hokkaido. Genetic distance between Hokkaido and Nagano was larger than between Hokkaido and north Primorsky Krai, and between Nagano and Gangwon-do, crossing national borders and the natural barrier of the sea. Considering these results, L. wilfordii likely migrated from the Asian continent to the Japanese Archipelago using two routes: north route from Russian Far East to Hokkaido and Aomori, and south route from the Korean Peninsula to Nagano. Based on molecular dating, migration from the continent to the islands likely occurred from the middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. For effective conservation of L. wilfordii, Hokkaido and Nagano populations should be distinguished as different evolutionary significant units, although these two regions belong to the same country, because Hokkaido and Nagano populations are at the different ends of the two migratory routes based on the migration scenario.",

    "abstract": "How hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) coordinate their divisional axis relative to supportive niche cells and whether or not their divisional orientation is important for stem cell-driven hematopoiesis is poorly understood. Single cell RNA sequencing data from patients with the inherited bone marrow failure Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) show that ARHGEF2, a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and determinant of mitotic spindle orientation, is one of a restricted group of genes specifically downregulated in SDS HSCs and multipotent progenitors. Here, we describe Lfc/Arhgef2 as an important regulator of hematopoiesis in vivo. Transplanted Lfc/Arhgef2-/- bone marrow shows impaired hematopoietic recovery and a production deficit of long-term HSCs. These phenotypes cannot be explained by differences in numbers of transplanted HSCs, their cell cycle status, level of apoptosis, progenitor output or homing ability. Using live imaging of dividing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we show an increased frequency of misoriented divisions in the absence of Lfc/Arhgef2. Functional ARHGEF2 knockdown in human HSCs also impairs their ability to regenerate hematopoiesis, culminating in significantly smaller hematopoietic xenografts. Together, these data provide evidence demonstrating a conserved role for Lfc/Arhgef2 in orienting HSPC division and suggest that HSCs divide in certain orientations to establish hematopoiesis, the loss of which leads to their exhaustion in a mechanism that may underlie certain bone marrow failure syndromes.",

The lack of experimentally determined and computationally inferred data means that the genome-wide CREs and TF binding sites (TFBs) in filamentous fungi remain unknown. ATAC-seq is a technique that provides a high-resolution measurement of chromatin accessibility to Tn5 transposase integration. In filamentous fungi, the existence of cell walls and the difficulty in purifying nuclei have prevented the routine application of this technique. Herein, we modified the ATAC-seq protocol in filamentous fungi to identify and map open chromatin and TF-binding sites on a genome-scale. We applied the assay for ATAC-seq among different Aspergillus species, during different culture conditions, and among TF-deficient strains to delineate open chromatin regions and TFBs across each genome. The syntenic orthologues regions and differential changes regions of chromatin accessibility were responsible for functional conservative regulatory elements and differential gene expression in the Aspergillus genome respectively. Importantly, 17 and 15 novel transcription factor binding motifs that were enriched in the genomic footprints identified from ATAC-seq data of A. niger, were verified in vivo by our artificial synthetic minimal promoter system, respectively. Furthermore, we first confirmed the strand-specific patterns of Tn5 transposase around the binding sites of known TFs by comparing ATAC-seq data of TF-deficient strains with the data from a wild-type strain.",

    "abstract": "Homonyms are a critical test case for investigating how the brain resolves ambiguity in language and, more generally, how context influences semantic processing. Previous neuroimaging studies have associated processing of homonyms with greater engagement of regions involved in executive control of semantic processing. However, the precise role of these areas and the involvement of semantic representational regions in homonym comprehension remain elusive. We addressed this by combining univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses of homonym processing. We tested whether multi-voxel activation patterns could discriminate between presentations of the same homonym in different contexts (e.g., bark following tree vs. bark following dog). The ventral anterior temporal lobe, implicated in semantic representation but not previously in homonym comprehension, showed this meaning-specific coding, despite not showing increased mean activation for homonyms. Within inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a key site for semantic control, there was a dissociation between pars orbitalis, which also showed meaning-specific coding, and pars triangularis, which discriminated more generally between semantically related and unrelated word pairs. IFG effects were goal-dependent, only occurring when the task required semantic decisions, in line with a top-down control function. Finally, posterior middle temporal cortex showed a hybrid pattern of responses, supporting the idea that it acts as an interface between semantic representations and the control system. The study provides new evidence for context-dependent coding in the semantic system and clarifies the role of control regions in processing ambiguity. It also highlights the importance of combining univariate and multivariate neuroimaging data to fully elucidate the role of a brain region in semantic cognition.",

DNP-INT is considered an effective inhibitor of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PETC) through its binding at the Q0 site of Cyt-b6f. The binding and action of DNP-INT has been previously characterized spectroscopically in purified Cyt-b6f complex reconstituted with Plastocyanin, PSII membranes and plastoquinone, as well as in isolated thylakoids based on its property to block MV-mediated O2 consumption. Contrary to the conclusions made from these experiments, we observed clear reduction of P700+ in samples incubated with DNP-INT during our recent investigation into the sites of oxygen consumption in isolated thylakoids. Therefore, we carried out an extensive investigation of DNP-INTs chemical efficacy in isolated thylakoids and intact leaves. This included examination of its capacity to block the PETC before PSI, and therefore its inhibition of CO2 fixation. P700 redox kinetics were measured using Dual-PAM whilst Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) was used for simultaneous determination of the rates of O2 evolution and O2 consumption in isolated thylakoids and CO2 fixation in intact leaves, using two stable isotopes of oxygen (16O2,18O2) and CO2 (12C,13C), respectively. Based on these investigations we confirmed that DNP-INT is unable to completely block the PETC and CO2 fixation, therefore its use may produce artefacts if applied to isolated thylakoids or intact cells, especially when determining the locations of reactive oxygen species formation in the photosynthetic apparatus.",

Despite such critical biological roles, the structures and patterns of oligomeric assembly remain unclear. Here, we reveal the first structures of two CALHMs, CALHM1 and CALHM2, by single particle cryo-electron microscopy, which show novel assembly of the four transmembrane helices into channels of 8-mers and 11-mers, respectively.

In Gossypium hirsutum (cotton), four distinct trichomatic nectaries develop, one floral and three extrafloral. The secreted floral and extrafloral nectars serve different purposes, with the floral nectar attracting bees to promote pollination and the extrafloral nectar attracting predatory insects as a means of indirect resistance from herbivores. Cotton therefore provides an ideal system to contrast mechanisms of nectar production and nectar composition between floral and extrafloral nectaries. Here, we report the transcriptome, ultrastructure, and metabolite spatial distribution using mass spectrometric imaging of the four cotton nectary types throughout development. Additionally, the secreted nectar metabolomes were defined and were jointly composed of 197 analytes, 60 of which were identified. Integration of theses datasets support the coordination of merocrine-based and eccrine-based models of nectar synthesis. The nectary ultrastructure supports the merocrine-based model due to the abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum positioned parallel to the cell walls and profusion of vesicles fusing to the plasma membranes. The eccrine-based model which consist of a progression from starch synthesis to starch degradation and to sucrose biosynthesis was supported by gene expression data. This demonstrates conservation of the eccrine-based model for the first time in both trichomatic and extrafloral nectaries. Lastly, nectary gene expression data provided evidence to support de novo synthesis of amino acids detected in the secreted nectars.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe eccrine-based model of nectar synthesis and secretion is conserved in both trichomatic and extrafloral nectaries determined by a system-based comparison of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) nectaries.",

We investigated if these structural gradients are associated with a similar gradient in a prominent feature of brain activity - namely the frequency of brain oscillations. In resting-state MEG recordings from healthy participants (N=187), we found that the strongest peak frequency in a brain area decreases significantly, gradually and robustly along the posterior-anterior axis following the global hierarchy from early sensory to higher-order areas. This spatial gradient of peak frequency was significantly anticorrelated with the cortical thickness of corresponding areas representing a proxy of the cortical hierarchical level. This result indicates that the intrinsic  resonance frequency decreases systematically from early sensory to higher-order areas and establishes a new structure-function relationship pertaining to brain oscillations as a core organizational principle that may underlie hierarchical specialization in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n\nRegulator-of-gene-silencing calmodulins (rgsCaM) represent a phylogenetic subfamily of calmodulin-like calcium sensors that are targets of viral induced suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing by secondary siRNAs. The present work shows that a stress (hypoxia) that induces mRNP granule formation also induces the relocalization of rgsCaM to cytosolic granule-like foci that interact with the surface of stress granule and processing body structures. Co-expression of rgsCaM and its binding protein Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 causes re-localization and integration of rgsCaM into stress granule structures. RgsCaMs contain a conserved topology that consists for four EF hand like domains (three functional and one divergent) that are separated into two calcium binding lobes with an extended amino terminal region. RgsCaM also contains an \"ATG8 family interacting motif\" (AIM) within its amino-terminal domain that is characteristic of selective autophagy cargo receptors. Co-localization experiments and ratiometric BiFC analyses in Nicotiana benthamiana support the hypothesis that rgsCaM binds directly to ATG8e through this conserved AIM domain, and the two proteins co-localize with mRNP granule markers. Previous reports show that rgsCaM mediates the suppression of gene silencing, at least in part, via turnover of SGS3 via autophagy. A model is proposed for rgsCaM-like proteins as potential mediators of selective autophagy of RNA granules in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.",

    "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment, given the dependence of prostate cells on androgen and the androgen receptor (AR). However, tumors become ADT-resistant, and there is a need to understand the mechanism. One possible mechanism is the upregulation of AR co-regulators, although only a handful have been definitively linked to disease. We previously identified the Mediator subunit MED19 as an AR co-regulator, and reported that MED19 depletion inhibits AR transcriptional activity and growth of androgen-insensitive LNCaP-abl cells. Therefore, we proposed that MED19 upregulation would promote AR activity and drive androgen-independent growth. Here, we show that stable overexpression of MED19 in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells promotes growth under conditions of androgen deprivation. To delineate the mechanism, we determined the MED19 and AR transcriptomes and cistromes in control and MED19 LNCaP cells. We also examined H3K27 acetylation genome-wide. MED19 overexpression selectively alters AR occupancy, H3K27 acetylation, and gene expression. Under conditions of androgen deprivation, genes regulated by MED19 and genomic sites occupied by MED19 and AR are enriched for ELK1, a transcription factor that binds the AR N-terminus to promote select AR-target gene expression. Strikingly, MED19 upregulates expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a factor that promotes prostate cancer growth. MAOA depletion reduces androgen-independent growth. MED19 and AR occupy the MAOA promoter, with MED19 overexpression enhancing AR occupancy and H3K27 acetylation. Furthermore, MED19 overexpression increases ELK1 occupancy at the MAOA promoter, and ELK1 depletion reduces MAOA expression and androgen-independent growth. This suggests that MED19 cooperates with ELK1 to regulate AR occupancy and H3K27 acetylation at MAOA, upregulating its expression and driving androgen independence in prostate cancer cells. This study provides important insight into the mechanisms of prostate cancer cell growth under low androgen, and underscores the importance of the MED19-MAOA axis in this process.\n\nAuthor summaryProstate cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and androgen hormones are essential for prostate cancer growth. Androgens exert their effects through a protein called the androgen receptor (AR), which turns on and off genes that regulate prostate cancer growth. Powerful drugs that block AR action by lowering androgen levels - so-called androgen deprivation therapy - are used to treat prostate cancer patients, and these yield initial success in reducing tumor growth. However, over time, tumors circumvent androgen deprivation therapy and patients relapse; in many cases, this occurs because AR becomes re-activated. The factors responsible for re-activating AR and promoting growth under androgen deprivation are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that a subunit of the Mediator transcriptional regulatory complex, called MED19, promotes growth of prostate cancer cells under low androgen conditions, mimicking the ability of tumors to grow under androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients. MED19 promotes androgen-independent growth by working with a transcription factor that interacts with AR, called ELK1, to induce the expression of genes regulated by AR that promote prostate cancer growth. This study provides important insight into how prostate cancer cells can maintain growth under androgen deprivation through MED19.",

    "abstract": "Loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens and multisystem tissue destruction is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although the source of autoantigen in lupus remains elusive, a compelling hypothetical source is dead cell debris that drives autoimmune activation. Prior reports suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and their associated death pathway, NETosis, are sources of autoantigen in SLE. However, others and we have shown that inhibition of NETs by targeting the NADPH oxidase complex and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) did not ameliorate disease in spontaneous murine models of SLE. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase and PADI4 deletion did not inhibit induced lupus. Since NET formation may occur independently of any one mediator, to address this controversy, we genetically deleted an additional important mediator of NETs and neutrophil effector function, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), in the MRL.Faslpr model of SLE. ELANE deficiency, and by extension ELANE-dependent NETs, had no effect on SLE nephritis, dermatitis, anti-self response, or immune composition in MRL.Faslpr mice. Taken together with prior data from our group and others, these data further challenge the paradigm that NETs and neutrophils are pathogenic in SLE.",

Our results underline the critical role of antagonistic interactions between the front and the rear, in particular the role of biophysical processes including formation of barriers and transport of specific proteins to the back of the cell.

However, the mechanisms underlying the lineage restriction process remain unclear. Here, using a combination of novel fluorescent knock-in reporters, live imaging, Cre/lox-mediated lineage tracing, atomic force microscopy-based cell adhesion assays, and mutant analysis, we analyze the process of lineage restriction at the MHB and provide mechanistic details. Specifically, we show that lineage restriction occurs by the end of gastrulation, and that the subsequent formation of sharp gene expression boundaries in the developing MHB occur through complementary mechanisms, namely cell-fate plasticity and cell sorting. Further, we show that cell sorting at the MHB involves differential adhesion among midbrain and hindbrain cells that is mediated by N-cadherin and Eph-Ephrin signaling.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of the negative regulatory element of the tyrosine kinase Lck by Csk down-modulates T-cell receptor induced signalling. Being constitutively active, Csk spatial organization is responsible for regulating this signalling interaction. Here, we used stoichiometrically accurate, multiplexed, single-molecule super-resolution microscopy (DNA-qPAINT) to image the nanoscale spatial architecture of Csk and two binding partners implicated in its membrane association - PAG and TRAF3. Combined with a newly developed co-clustering analysis framework, we provide a powerful resource for dissecting signalling pathways regulated by spatio-temporal organisation. We found that Csk forms nanoscale clusters proximal to the plasma membrane that are lost post-stimulation and re-recruited at later time points. Unexpectedly, these clusters do not directly co-localise with PAG at the membrane, but instead provide a ready pool of monomers to down-regulate signalling. By generating CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out T-cells, our data also identify that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is essential for Csk nanocluster re-recruitment and for maintenance of the synaptic PAG population.",

    "abstract": "Sm-class ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are ring-shaped structures (Sm cores) formed by Sm hetero-heptamer around a segment of RNA, containing a nonameric oligoribonucleotide, PuAUUUNUGPu, followed by a stem-loop, and are basic structural modules critical for stability and functions of spliceosomal, telomerase and U7 RNPs. In the chaperones-assisted Sm core assembly, Gemin2 of the SMN complex, not only binds SmD1/D2/F/E/G (5Sm), but also serves as a checkpoint via a negative cooperativity mechanism uncovered in our recent study: Gemin2 constricts the horseshoe-shaped 5Sm in a narrow conformation from outside, preventing non-cognate RNA and SmD3/B from joining; only cognate RNA can bind inside 5Sm and widen 5Sm, dissociating Gemin2 from 5Sm and recruiting SmD3/B. However, the structural mechanics is unknown. Here I describe a coordinate-improved structure of 5Sm bound by Gemin2/SMN. Moreover, via new analysis, comparison of this structure with those of newly coordinate-improved Sm cores reveals the negative cooperativity mechanism between Gemin2 and RNA in binding 5Sm at atomic resolution level and provides structural insights into RNA selection and Gemin2s release in Sm core assembly. Finally, implications in the evolution of the Sm-core assembly chaperoning machinery and the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy caused by SMN deficiency are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Deriving the detailed synaptic connections of the entire nervous system has been a long term but unrealized goal of the nascent field of connectomics. For Drosophila, in particular, three sample preparation problems must be solved before the requisite imaging and analysis can even begin. The first is dissecting the brain, connectives, and ventral nerve cord (roughly comparable to the brain, neck, and spinal cord of vertebrates) as a single contiguous unit. Second is fixing and staining the resulting specimen, too large for previous techniques such as flash freezing, so as to permit the necessary automated segmentation of neuron membranes. Finally the contrast must be sufficient to support synapse detection at imaging speeds that enable the entire connectome to be collected. To address these issues, we report three major novel methods to dissect, fix, dehydrate and stain this tiny but complex nervous system in its entirety; together they enable us to uncover a Focused Ion-Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) connectome of the entire Drosophila brain. They reliably recover fixed neurons as round profiles with darkly stained synapses, suitable for machine segmentation and automatic synapse detection, for which only minimal human intervention is required. Our advanced procedures use: a custom-made jig to microdissect both regions of the central nervous system, dorsal and ventral, with their connectives; fixation and Durcupan embedment, followed by a special hot-knife slicing protocol to reduce the brain to dimensions suited to FIB; contrast enhancement by heavy metals; together with a progressive lowering of temperature protocol for dehydration. Collectively these optimize the brains morphological preservation, imaging it at a usual resolution of 8nm per voxel while simultaneously speeding the formerly slow rate of FIB-SEM. With these methods we could recently obtain a FIB-SEM image stack of the Drosophila brain eight times faster than hitherto, at approximately the same rate as, but without the requirement to cut, nor imperfections in, EM serial sections.",
