    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental illnesses and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Electronic Health Records (EHR) allow researchers to conduct unprecedented large-scale observational studies investigating MDD, its disease development and its interaction with other health outcomes. While there exist methods to classify patients as clear cases or controls, given specific data requirements, there are presently no simple, generalizable, and validated methods to classify an entire patient population into varying groups of depression likelihood and severity.\n\nMethodsWe have tested a simple, pragmatic electronic phenotype algorithm that classifies patients into one of five mutually exclusive, ordinal groups, varying in depression phenotype. Using data from an integrated health system on 278,026 patients from a 10-year study period we have tested the convergent validity of these constructs using measures of external validation, including patterns of psychiatric prescriptions, symptom severity, indicators of suicidality, comorbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and polygenic risk scores for MDD.\n\nResultsWe found consistent patterns of increasing morbidity and/or adverse outcomes across the five groups, providing evidence for convergent validity.\n\nLimitationsThe study population is from a single rural integrated health system which is predominantly white, possibly limiting its generalizability.\n\nConclusionOur study provides initial evidence that a simple algorithm, generalizable to most EHR data sets, provides categories with meaningful face and convergent validity that can be used for stratification of an entire patient population.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful tool for resolving cellular states associated with normal and maligned developmental processes. Here, we used scRNA-seq to examine the cell cycle states of expanding human neural stem cells (hNSCs). From this data, we created a cell cycle classifier, which, in addition to traditional cell cycle phases, also identifies a putative quiescent-like state in neuroepithelial-derived cell types during mammalian neurogenesis and in gliomas. This state, Neural G0, is enriched for expression of quiescent NSC genes and other neurodevelopmental markers found in non-dividing neural progenitors. For gliomas, Neural G0 cell populations and gene expression is significantly associated with less aggressive tumors and extended patient survival. Genetic screens to identify modulators of Neural G0 revealed that knockout of genes associated with the Hippo/Yap and p53 pathways diminished Neural G0 in vitro, resulting in faster G1 transit, down regulation of quiescence-associated markers, and loss of Neural G0 gene expression. Thus, Neural G0 represents a dynamic quiescent-like state found in neuro-epithelial derived cells and gliomas.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a rapidly evolving technology that enables measurement of gene expression levels at an unprecedented resolution. Despite the explosive growth in the number of cells that can be assayed by a single experiment, scRNA-seq still has several limitations, including high rates of dropouts, which result in a large number of genes having zero read count in the scRNA-seq data, and complicate downstream analyses.\\n\\nMethodsTo overcome this problem, we treat zeros as missing values and develop nonparametric deep learning methods for imputation. Specifically, our LATE (Learning with AuToEncoder) method trains an autoencoder with random initial values of the parameters, whereas our TRANSLATE (TRANSfer learning with LATE) method further allows for the use of a reference gene expression data set to provide LATE with an initial set of parameter estimates.\\n\\nResultsOn both simulated and real data, LATE and TRANSLATE outperform existing scRNA-seq imputation methods, achieving lower mean squared error in most cases, recovering nonlinear gene-gene relationships, and better separating cell types. They are also highly scalable and can efficiently process over 1 million cells in just a few hours on a GPU.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that our nonparametric approach to imputation based on autoencoders is powerful and highly efficient.",

    "abstract": "Closely related species with parapatric elevational ranges are ubiquitous in tropical mountains worldwide. The gradient speciation hypothesis proposes that these series are the result of in situ ecological speciation driven by divergent selection across elevation. Direct tests of this scenario have been hampered by the difficulty inferring the geographic arrangement of populations at the time of divergence. In cichlids, sticklebacks, and Timema stick insects, support for ecological speciation driven by other selective pressures has come from demonstrating parallel speciation, where divergence proceeds independently across replicated environmental gradients. Here, we take advantage of the unique geography of the island of New Guinea to test for parallel gradient speciation in replicated populations of Syma kingfishers that show extremely subtle differentiation across elevation and between historically isolated mountain ranges. We find that currently described high elevation and low elevation species have reciprocally monophyletic gene trees and form nuclear DNA clusters, rejecting this hypothesis. However, demographic modeling suggests selection has likely maintained species boundaries in the face of gene flow following secondary contact. We compile evidence from the published literature to show that while in situ gradient speciation in labile organisms such as birds appears rare, divergent selection and post-speciation gene flow may be an underappreciated force in the origin of elevational series and tropical beta diversity along mountain slopes.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown promise in the treatment of hematological cancers and is currently being investigated for solid tumors including high-grade glioma brain tumors. There is a desperate need to quantitatively study the factors that contribute to the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in solid tumors. In this work we use a mathematical model of predator-prey dynamics to explore the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing in glioma: the Chimeric Antigen Receptor t-cell treatment Response in GliOma (CARRGO) model. The model includes rates of cancer cell proliferation, CAR T-cell killing, CAR T-cell proliferation and exhaustion, and CAR T-cell persistence. We use patient-derived and engineered cancer cell lines with an in vitro real-time cell analyzer to parameterize the CARRGO model. We observe that CAR T-cell dose correlates inversely with the killing rate and correlates directly with the net rate of proliferation and exhaustion. This suggests that at a lower dose of CAR T-cells, individual T-cells kill more cancer cells but become more exhausted as compared to higher doses. Furthermore, the exhaustion rate was observed to increase significantly with tumor growth rate and was dependent on level of antigen expression. The CARRGO model highlights nonlinear dynamics involved in CAR T-cell therapy and provides novel insights into the kinetics of CAR T-cell killing. The model suggests that CAR T-cell treatment may be tailored to individual tumor characteristics including tumor growth rate and antigen level to maximize therapeutic benefit.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe utilize a mathematical model to deconvolute the nonlinear contributions of CAR T-cell proliferation and exhaustion to predict therapeutic efficacy and dependence on CAR T-cell dose and target antigen levels.",

The clusters of reference genomes formed by Genome Constellation closely resemble known phylogenetic relationships while simultaneously revealing unexpected connections. In a dataset containing 1,693 draft genomes assembled from the Antarctic lake communities where only 40% could be placed in a phylogenetic tree, Genome Constellation improves taxa assignment to 61%. It revealed six clusters derived from new bacterial phyla and 63 new giant viruses, 3 of which missed by the traditional marker-based approach.

The potential of this invasive tick vector to transmit pathogens will be determined through its association to native hosts, such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) which is the primary reservoir for the causative agent of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) and other zoonotic pathogens. We placed larval H. longicornis on P. leucopus, 65% of the larvae (n = 40) moved off the host within a short period of time and none engorged. In contrast, larval black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) did not move from where they were placed in the ear of the mouse. We then conducted a laboratory behavioural assay to assess the interaction of H. longicornis with the hair of potential mammalian host species in the United States of America. H. longicornis larvae were less likely to enter the hair zone of P. leucopus and humans compared to the hair of domestic cats, domestic dogs, and white-tailed deer. Our study identifies a tick-host hair interaction behaviour, which can be quantified in a laboratory assay to predict tick-host associations and provides insights into how ticks select a host.",

    "abstract": "Handedness, a consistent asymmetry in skill or use of the hands, has been studied extensively because of its relationship with language and the over-representation of left-handers in some neurodevelopmental disorders. Using data from the UK Biobank, 23andMe and 32 studies from the International Handedness Consortium, we conducted the worlds largest genome-wide association study of handedness (1,534,836 right-handed, 194,198 (11.0%) left-handed and 37,637 (2.1%) ambidextrous individuals). We found 41 genetic loci associated with left-handedness and seven associated with ambidexterity at genome-wide levels of significance (P < 5x10-8). Tissue enrichment analysis implicated the central nervous system and brain tissues including the hippocampus and cerebrum in the etiology of left-handedness. Pathways including regulation of microtubules, neurogenesis, axonogenesis and hippocampus morphology were also highlighted. We found suggestive positive genetic correlations between being left-handed and some neuropsychiatric traits including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. SNP heritability analyses indicated that additive genetic effects of genotyped variants explained 5.9% (95% CI = 5.8% - 6.0%) of the underlying liability of being left-handed, while the narrow sense heritability was estimated at 12% (95% CI = 7.2% - 17.7%). Further, we show that genetic correlation between left-handedness and ambidexterity is low (rg = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.08 - 0.43) implying that these traits are largely influenced by different genetic mechanisms. In conclusion, our findings suggest that handedness, like many other complex traits is highly polygenic, and that the genetic variants that predispose to left-handedness may underlie part of the association with some psychiatric disorders that has been observed in multiple observational studies.",

    "abstract": "The cuticle, a hydrophobic layer of cutin and waxes synthesized by plant epidermal cells, is the major barrier to water loss when stomata are closed at night and under water-limited conditions. Elucidating the genetic architecture of natural variation for leaf cuticular conductance (gc) is important for identifying genes relevant to improving crop productivity in drought-prone environments. To this end, we conducted a genome-wide association study of gc of adult leaves in a maize inbred association panel that was evaluated in four environments (Maricopa, AZ, and San Diego, CA in 2016 and 2017). Five genomic regions significantly associated with gc were resolved to seven plausible candidate genes (ISTL1, two SEC14 homologs, cyclase-associated protein, a CER7 homolog, GDSL lipase, and {beta}-D-XYLOSIDASE 4). These candidates are potentially involved in cuticle biosynthesis, trafficking and deposition of cuticle lipids, cutin polymerization, and cell wall modification. Laser microdissection RNA sequencing revealed that all these candidate genes, with the exception of the CER7 homolog, were expressed in the zone of the expanding adult maize leaf where cuticle maturation occurs. With direct application to genetic improvement, moderately high average predictive abilities were observed for whole-genome prediction of gc in locations (0.46 and 0.45) and across all environments (0.52). The findings of this study provide novel insights into the genetic control of gc and have the potential to help breeders more effectively develop drought-tolerant maize for target environments.\\n\\nArticle summaryThe cuticle serves as the major barrier to water loss when stomata are closed at night and under water-limited conditions and potentially relevant to drought tolerance in crops.

Their presumed function is to recruit help, but it is uncertain whether this is mediated by listeners extracting the nature of the disturbance from calls. To address this, we used machine learning to analyse distress calls produced by wild infant chimpanzees. It enabled us to classify calls and examine them in relation to the external event triggering them and the distance to the intended receiver, the mother. In further steps, we tested whether the acoustic variants produced by infants predicted maternal responses. Our results demonstrated that, although infant chimpanzee distress calls were highly graded, they conveyed information about discrete events, which in turn guided maternal parenting decisions. We discuss these findings in light of one the most vexing problems in communication theory, the evolution of vocal flexibility in the human lineage.",

    "abstract": "Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) removes DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at DNA lesions initiates TCR through the recruitment of the CSB and CSA proteins. The full repertoire of proteins required for human TCR - particularly in a chromatin context - remains to be determined. Studies in mice have revealed that the nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1 is required to enhance the repair of UV-induced lesions in transcribed genes. However, whether HMGN1 is required for human TCR remains unaddressed. Here, we show that knockout or knockdown of HMGN1, either alone or in combination with HMGN2, does not render human cells sensitive to UV light or Illudin S-induced transcription-blocking DNA lesions. Moreover, transcription restart after UV irradiation was not impaired in HMGN-deficient cells. In contrast, TCR-deficient cells were highly sensitive to DNA damage and failed to restart transcription. Furthermore, GFP-tagged HMGN1 was not recruited to sites of UV-induced DNA damage under conditions were GFP-CSB readily accumulated. In line with this, HMGN1 did not associate with the TCR complex, nor did TCR proteins require HMGN1 to associate with DNA damage-stalled RNAPII. Together, our findings suggest that HMGN1 and HMGN2 are not required for human TCR.",

    "abstract": "Phylogeny estimation is an important part of much biological research, but large-scale tree estimation is infeasible using standard methods due to computational issues. Recently, an approach to large-scale phylogeny has been proposed that divides a set of species into disjoint subsets, computes trees on the subsets, and then merges the trees together using a computed matrix of pairwise distances between the species. The novel component of these approaches is the last step: Disjoint Tree Merger (DTM) methods. We present GTM (Guide Tree Merger), a polynomial time DTM method that adds edges to connect the subset trees, so as to provably minimize the topological distance to a computed guide tree. Thus, GTM performs unblended mergers, unlike the previous DTM methods. Yet, despite the potential limitation, our study shows that GTM has excellent accuracy, generally matching or improving on two previous DTMs, and is much faster than both. Thus, the GTM approach to the DTM problem is a useful new tool for large-scale phylogenomic analysis, and shows the surprising potential for unblended DTM methods. The software for GTM is available at https://github.com/vlasmirnov/GTM.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence indicating that gut microbiota contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The most widely-used model for T2D research is the leptin deficient db/db mouse model. Yet, a characterisation of the gut microbial composition in this model in relationship with the metabolism is lacking. The objectives of this study were to identify metabolomics and microbial modulations associated with T2D in the db/db mouse model. The majority of microbial changes observed included an increase of Enterobacteriaceae and a decrease of Clostridiales in diabetics. The metabolomics interrogation of caecum indicated a lower proteolytic activity in diabetics, who also showed higher Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) levels. In the case of faeces, the model identified 9 metabolites, the main ones were acetate, butyrate and Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs). Finally, liver was the organ with more metabolic links with gut-microbiota followed by the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA). In conclusion, the interaction between Clostridiales and Enterococcus with caecal metabolism could play a key role in the onset and development of diabetes. Further studies should investigate whether the role of these bacteria is causal or co-occurring.",

Currently, the cassava whitefly complex is divided into species and subgroups based on very limited molecular markers that did not allow clear definition of species and population structure. Based on 14,358 genome-wide SNPs from 63 cassava whitefly individuals belonging to sub-Saharan African (SSA1, SSA2 and SSA4) species, and using a well-curated mtCOI gene database, we show clear incongruities in previous taxonomic approaches underpinned by effects from pseudogenes. We show that the SSA4 species is part of the SSA2 species, and that populations of the SSA1 species comprise of south-eastern (Madagascar, Tanzania) and north-western (Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi) sub-species that show signatures of allopatric incipient speciation, with a hybrid zone separating these adjacent sub-species. These findings provide the first genomic insights into the evolution and molecular ecology of a highly cryptic hemipteran insect complex in African, and allow the systematic use of genomic data in management and control strategies for this important cassava pest.",

    "abstract": "Within the field of neuroimaging, there has been an increasing trend towards studying brain activity in naturalistic conditions, and it is possible to robustly estimate networks of on-going oscillatory activity in the brain. However, not many studies have focused on differences between individuals in on-going brain activity that would be associable to psychological or behavioral characteristics. Existing standard methods can perform well at single-participant level, but generalizing the methodology across many participants is challenging due to individual differences of brains. As an example of a clinically relevant, naturalistic condition we consider here mindfulness. Trait mindfulness, as well as a mindfulness-based intervention cultivating focused attention, is often associated with benefits for psychological health. Therefore, the manner in which the brain engages in focused attention vs. mind wandering is likely to associate with individual differences in psycho-behavioral tendencies.\\n\\nWe recorded MEG from 29 participants both in a state of focused attention and in a state of simulated mind wandering. We used Principal Component Analysis to decompose spatial average activation maps of focused attention contrasted with two different mind wandering states. The first principal component, which reflected differential engagement of bilateral parietal areas during focused attention vs. mind wandering, was associated with behavioral characteristics of inhibition, anxiousness and depression, as measured by standard questionnaires. We demonstrated that such decomposition of time-averaged contrast maps can overcome some of the challenges in methods based on concatenated data, especially from the perspective of behaviorally and clinically relevant characteristics in the ongoing brain oscillatory activity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a specific method to analyse/establish associations between brain oscillations and behavioral characteristics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that activity levels in parietal areas during mind wandering compared to focused attention were associated with the behavioral trait of inhibition and anxiety.\\nC_LI",

Self-generated chemotaxis, where cells break down abundant attractants to create gradients, is an important but under-studied aspect of physiological navigation. Here we show that self-generated gradients allow cells to navigate arbitrarily complex paths and, remarkably, make accurate choices about pathways they have not yet encountered. This enables cells to solve microfluidic mazes, even with initially homogeneous environments and distant correct destinations. We combine computational models and experiments to understand how cells anticipate environmental features, and how decision accuracy is determined by path complexity, attractant diffusibility and cell speed. This permits mazes that are easy or hard for cells to resolve, despite similar appearances. Counterintuitively, slowly-diffusing attractants can generate a \"mirage\", making cells prefer dead ends over correct paths. In vivo environments resemble complex mazes, and only self-generated gradients realistically explain cell behaviour.",

    "abstract": "SummaryHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for the generation of blood and immune cells throughout life. They have the unique ability to self-renew and generate more HSCs or differentiate into a progenitor cell in response to cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stimuli. The balance of HSC fate commitment is critical for a healthy blood supply. Imbalances during hematopoiesis, which are frequent in aging, can result in hematological malignancies and pre-malignancies as well as increase risk of atherosclerosis. Given the importance of HSCs and their progenitors, they have been extensively characterized in genomic and transcriptomic studies. However, an understanding of protein expression within the HSC compartment and more broadly throughout hematopoiesis remains poorly understood, and it has been widely reported that the correlation between mRNA and proteins is more complicated than previously thought. Previous mouse mass spectrometry studies have focused either specifically on stem and the first early progenitor or broadly across mixed populations of stem and progenitor cells, which do not allow for cell-type specific protein resolution across stages of differentiation. Mass cytometry has been employed to characterize transcription factor expression in human HSCs and progenitors but does not apply an unbiased discovery approach. New mass spectrometry technology now allows for deep proteomic coverage with no more than 200 ng of sample input. We report here a proteomics resource characterizing protein expression in mouse adult and aged HSCs, multipotent progenitors and oligopotent progenitors, 12 cell types in total. We validated differential expression by flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between mRNA and protein levels of individual genes in HSCs compared to progenitors through RNA sequencing studies and identified two proteins that appear to be uniquely regulated in the HSC compartment, Cpin1 and Adnp. In summary, this resource provides proteomic coverage of adult and aged hematopoietic stem cells and their progenitors and reveals changes in protein abundance between cell types, with potential future implications in understanding mechanisms for stem-cell maintenance, niche interactions and fate determination.",

    "abstract": "The brains of Alzheimers Disease patients show a decrease in brain mass and a preponderance of extracellular Amyloid-{beta} plaques. These plaques are formed by aggregation of polypeptides that are derived from Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Amyloid-{beta} plaques are thought to play either a direct or an indirect role in disease progression, however the exact role of aggregation and plaque formation in the ethology of Alzheimers Disease is subject to debate, not least because the biological effects of soluble and aggregated Amyloid-{beta} peptides are difficult to separate in vivo. To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-{beta} oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-{beta} peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-{beta} oligomers underlie the pathologies of Alzheimers Disease. We show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization of Amyloid-{beta} were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-{beta} oligomerization from Amyloid-{beta} expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-{beta} oligomers also recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD. We show that the lifespan deficit induced by Amyloid-{beta} oligomers was reduced with Li+ treatment. Our results present the first model to separate different aspects of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary reinforcement learning (RL) theory suggests that potential choices can be evaluated by strategies that may or may not be sensitive to the computational structure of tasks. A paradigmatic model-free (MF) strategy simply repeats actions that have been rewarded in the past; by contrast, model-sensitive (MS) strategies exploit richer information associated with knowledge of task dynamics. MF and MS strategies should typically be combined, because they have complementary statistical and computational strengths; however, this tradeoff between MF/MS RL has mostly only been demonstrated in humans, often with only modest numbers of trials. We trained rhesus monkeys to perform a two-stage decision task designed to elicit and discriminate the use of MF and MS methods. A descriptive analysis of choice behaviour revealed directly that the structure of the task (of MS importance) and the reward history (of MF and MS importance) significantly influenced both choice and response vigour. A detailed, trial-by-trial computational analysis confirmed that choices were made according to a combination of strategies, with a dominant influence of a particular form of model sensitivity that persisted over weeks of testing. The residuals from this model necessitated development of a new combined RL model which incorporates a particular credit assignment weighting procedure. Finally, response vigor exhibited a subtly different collection of MF and MS influences. These results provide new illumination onto RL behavioural processes in non-human primates.",

The final synthesis of heme occurs in mitochondria, where ferrochelatase (FECH) inserts Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX to produce proto-heme IX. We previously showed that FECH inhibition is antiangiogenic in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) and in animal models of ocular neovascularization. In the present study, we sought to understand the mechanism of how FECH and thus heme is involved in endothelial cell function. Mitochondria in endothelial cells had several defects in function after heme inhibition. FECH loss changed the shape and mass of mitochondria and led to significant oxidative stress. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial Complex IV were decreased in HRECs and in murine retina ex vivo after heme depletion. Supplementation with heme partially rescued phenotypes of FECH blockade.

    "abstract": "How local interactions of actin regulators yield large-scale organization of cell shape and movement is not well understood. For example, why does the WAVE complex build lamellipodia, the broad sheet-like protrusions that power cell migration, whereas the homologous actin regulator N-WASP forms spiky finger-like actin networks? N-WASP is known to oligomerize into focal condensates that generate an actin finger. In contrast, the WAVE complex exhibits the linear distribution needed to generate an actin sheet. This linear organization of the WAVE complex could either arise from interactions with the actin cytoskeleton or could represent an ability of the complex to self-organize into a linear template. Using super-resolution microscopy, we find that the WAVE complex forms higher-order linear oligomers that curve into 270 nanometer-wide ring structures in the absence of actin polymer. These rings localize to the necks of membrane invaginations, which display saddle point geometries with positive curvature in one axis and negative curvature in the orthogonal axis. To investigate the molecular mechanism of saddle curvature enrichment, we show that the WAVE complex and IRSp53, a membrane curvature-sensitive protein, collaborate to recognize saddle curvature that IRSp53 cannot sense alone. This saddle preference for the WAVE complex could explain emergent cell behaviors, such as expanding and self-straightening lamellipodia as well as the ability of endothelial cells to recognize and seal transcellular holes. Our work highlights how partnering protein interactions enable complex shape sensing and how feedback between cell shape and actin regulators yields self-organized cell morphogenesis.",

Microalgae have evolved B12 dependence on multiple occasions and we previously demonstrated that experimental evolution of the non-requiring alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in media supplemented with B12 generated a B12-dependent mutant (hereafter metE7). This clone provides a unique opportunity to study the physiology of a nascent B12 auxotroph. Our analyses demonstrate that B12 deprivation of metE7 disrupted C1 metabolism, caused an accumulation of starch and triacylglycerides and a decrease in photosynthetic pigments, proteins and free amino acids. B12 deprivation also caused a substantial increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which preceded rapid cell death. Surprisingly, survival could be improved without compromising growth by simultaneously depriving the cells of nitrogen, suggesting a type of cross protection. Significantly, we found further improvements in survival under B12 limitation and an increase in B12 use-efficiency after metE7 underwent a further period of experimental evolution, this time in coculture with a B12-producing bacterium. Therefore, although an early B12-dependent alga would likely be poorly adapted to B12 deprivation, association with B12-producers can ensure long-term survival whilst also providing the environment to evolve mechanisms to better tolerate B12 limitation.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the fraction of cancer cells with individual somatic mutations is central to many analyses in cancer genomics, including characterisation of clonal architecture and timing of mutational events. Estimation of these cancer cell fractions (CCFs) is contingent on unbiased assessment of the fraction of reads supporting variant alleles (VAFs). We demonstrate that VAFs computed by the Illumina Isaac pipeline, used in many large-scale sequencing projects including The 100,000 Genomes Project, are biased by the preferential soft clipping of reads supporting non-reference alleles (semi-aligned reads). We show that these biased VAFs can have deleterious effects on downstream analyses reliant on unbiased CCF estimates. While Isaac bias can be corrected through realignment with alternative parameters, this is computationally intensive. We therefore developed FixVAF, a tool for removing bias introduced by soft clipping of semi-aligned reads, facilitating downstream analyses without the need for realignment.

    "abstract": "Insights into oncogenesis derived from cancer susceptibility loci could facilitate better cancer management and treatment through precision oncology. However, therapeutic applications have thus far been limited by our current lack of understanding regarding both their interactions with somatic cancer driver mutations and their influence on tumorigenesis. Here, by integrating germline datasets relating to cancer susceptibility with tumour data capturing somatically-acquired genetic variation, we provide evidence that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway can interact to influence cancer development, progression and treatment response. We go on to provide human genetic evidence of a tumor-promoting role for the pro-survival activities of p53, which supports the development of more effective therapy combinations through their inhibition in cancers retaining wild-type p53.\n\nSignificanceWe describe significant interactions between heritable and somatic genetic variants in the p53 pathway that affect cancer susceptibility, progression and treatment response. Our results offer evidence of how cancer susceptibility SNPs can interact with cancer driver genes to affect cancer progression and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Nightmares are vivid, extended and extremely dysphoric dreams that awaken the dreamer. Twin studies indicate that nightmare frequency has a heritability between 36 and 51% providing evidence for genetic factors underlying predisposition to nightmares. Furthermore, while cross-sectional epidemiological findings suggest that heavy alcohol usage, traumatic experiences and psychiatric diseases associate with nightmares, the causal relationships between these conditions and nightmares have remained unknown. To examine the biological mechanisms behind nightmares, we performed a genome-wide association study in 28,596 individuals from Finland and the United States. We identified individual genetic variants that predispose to nightmares near MYOF (rs701873, p=2.18e-8) and PTPRJ (rs11039471,p=3.7e-8), a gene previously associated with sleep duration. We found a strong genetic correlation between the frequency of nightmares and traits related to personality and psychiatric disorders; neuroticism (rg=0.59, p=8e-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (rg=0.58, p=0.004) as well as major depressive disorder (rg=0.68, p=7e-4), and sleep traits; and daytime sleepiness (rg=0.62, p=1e-6) and insomnia (rg=0.50, p=1.87e-5). Analysis of directionality using mendelian randomization showed a significant effect from feelings of fed-up (p=0.001), nervous (p=0.004) and miserableness (p=0.0045) to nightmares with no evidence of pleiotropy and no evidence of nightmares predisposing to psychiatric or psychological problems. Our findings suggest that nightmares are caused by unique genetic risk factors, and here we identify the first individual genetic associations. In addition, a substantial effect on nightmares is conveyed through underlying psychological and sleep problems, with psychological problems being causal for nightmares.",

    "abstract": "The horn fly, Haematobia irritans irritans, is a hematophagous parasite of livestock distributed throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Welfare losses on livestock due to horn fly infestation are estimated to cost between USD 1-2.5 billion annually in North America and Brazil. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis is a maternally inherited manipulator of reproductive biology in arthropods and naturally infects laboratory colonies of horn flies from Kerrville, USA and Alberta, Canada, but has also been identified in wild-caught samples from Canada, USA, Mexico and Hungary. Reassembly of PacBio long-read and Illumina genomic DNA libraries from the Kerrville H. i. irritans genome project allowed for a complete and circularised 1.3 Mb Wolbachia genome (wHae). Annotation of wHae yielded 1249 coding genes, 34 tRNAs, three rRNAs, and five prophage regions. Comparative genomics and whole genome Bayesian evolutionary analysis of wHae compared to published Wolbachia genomes suggests that wHae is most closely related to and diverged from Wolbachia supergroup A strains known to infect Drosophila spp. Whole-genome synteny analyses between wHae and closely related genomes indicates that wHae has undergone convoluted genome rearrangements while maintaining high nucleotide identity. Comparative analysis of the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) genes of wHae suggests two phylogenetically distinct CI loci and acquisition of another CifB homolog from phylogenetically distant supergroup A Wolbachia strains suggesting horizontal acquisition of these loci. The wHae genome provides a resource for future examination of the impact Wolbachia may have in both biocontrol and potential insecticide resistance of horn flies.\\n\\nImportanceHorn flies, Haematobia irritans, are obligate hematophagous parasites of cattle having significant effects on production and animal welfare. Control of horn flies mainly relies on the use of insecticides, but issues with resistance have increased interest in development of alternative means of control. Wolbachia pipientis is an endosymbiont bacterium known to have a range of effects on host reproduction such as induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, male killing, and also impacts on vector transmission. These characteristics of Wolbachia have been exploited in biological control approaches for a range of insect pests. Here we report the assembly and annotation of the circular genome of the Wolbachia strain of the Kerrickville, USA horn fly (wHae). Annotation of wHae suggests its unique features including the horizontal acquisition of additional transcriptionally active cytoplasmic incompatibility loci. This study will provide the foundation for future Wolbachia-induced biological effect studies for control of horn flies.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation requires assembly of the multiprotein kinetochore complex at centromeres. In most eukaryotes, kinetochore assembly is primed by the histone H3 variant CenH3, which physically interacts with components of the inner kinetochore constitutive-centromere-associated-network (CCAN). Unexpected to its critical function, previous work identified that select eukaryotic lineages, including several insects, have lost CenH3, while having retained homologs of the CCAN. These findings imply alternative CCAN assembly pathways in these organisms that function in CenH3-independent manners. Here, we study the composition and assembly of CenH3-deficient kinetochores of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). We show that lepidopteran kinetochores consist of previously identified CCAN homologs as well as additional components including a divergent CENP-T homolog, which are required for accurate mitotic progression. Our study focuses on CENP-T that we find both necessary and sufficient to recruit the Mis12 outer kinetochore complex. In addition, CRISPR-mediated gene editing in Bombyx mori establishes an essential function of CENP-T in vivo. Finally, the retention of CENP-T homologs in other independently-derived CenH3-deficient insects indicates a conserved mechanism of kinetochore assembly between these lineages. Our study provides the first functional insights into CCAN-based kinetochore assembly pathways that function independently of CenH3, thus contributing to the emerging picture of an unexpected plasticity to build a kinetochore.",

    "abstract": "Feeling guilty when we have wronged another is a crucial aspect of prosociality, but its neurobiological bases are elusive. Although multivariate patterns of brain activity show promise for developing brain measures linked to specific emotions, it is less clear whether brain activity can be trained to detect more complex social emotional states such as guilt. Here, we identified a distributed Guilt-Related Brain Signature (GRBS) across two independent neuroimaging datasets that used interpersonal interactions to evoke guilt. This signature discriminated conditions associated with interpersonal guilt from closely matched control conditions in a cross-validated training sample (N = 24; Chinese population) and in an independent test sample (N = 19; Swiss population). However, it did not respond to observed or experienced pain, or recalled guilt. Moreover, the GRBS only exhibited weak spatial similarity with other brain signatures of social affective processes, further indicating the specificity of the brain state it represents. These findings provide a step towards developing biological markers of social emotions, which could serve as important tools to investigate guilt-related brain processes in both healthy and clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which serves as the central pacemaker in mammals, regulates the 24-hour rhythm in behavioral activity. However, it is currently unclear whether and how bouts of activity and rest are regulated within the 24-hour cycle (i.e., over ultradian time scales). Therefore, we used passive infrared sensors to measure behavior in mice housed under either a light-dark (LD) cycle or continuous darkness (DD). We found that a probabilistic Markov model captures the ultradian changes in the behavioral state over a 24-hour cycle. In this model, the animals behavioral state in the next time interval is determined solely by the animals current behavioral state and by the \"toss\" of a proverbial \"biased coin\". We found that the bias of this \"coin\" is regulated by light input and by the phase of the clock. Moreover, the bias of this \"coin\" for an animal is related to the average length of rest and activity bouts in that animal. In LD conditions, the average length of rest bouts was greater during the day compared to during the night, whereas the average length of activity bouts was greater during the night compared to during the day. Importantly, we also found that day-night changes in the rest bout lengths were significantly greater than day-night changes in the activity bout lengths. Finally, in DD conditions, the activity and rest bouts also differed between subjective night and subjective day, albeit to a lesser extent compared to LD conditions. The persistent differences in bout length over the circadian cycle following loss of the external LD cycle indicate that the central pacemaker plays a role in regulating rest and activity bouts on an ultradian time scale.",

    "abstract": "Technological leaps are often driven by key innovations that transform the underlying architectures of systems. Current DNA storage systems largely rely on polymerase chain reaction, which broadly informs how information is encoded, databases are organized, and files are accessed. Here we show that a hybrid  toehold DNA structure can unlock a fundamentally different, dynamic DNA-based information storage system architecture with broad advantages. This innovation increases theoretical storage densities and capacities by eliminating non-specific DNA-DNA interactions common in PCR and increasing the encodable sequence space. It also provides a physical handle with which to implement a range of in-storage file operations. Finally, it reads files non-destructively by harnessing the natural role of transcription in accessing information from DNA. This simple but powerful toehold structure lays the foundation for an information storage architecture with versatile capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The nest structures built by social insects are complex group-level patterns that emerge from interactions among individuals following simple behavioral rules. The theory of complex systems predicts that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between variations in collective patterns and variation in individual behaviors; therefore, it is essential to know how actual behavior evolves to change pattern formation. Here we demonstrate that the evolutionary divergence of termite tunneling patterns is achieved by quantitative tuning of shared behavioral rules, rather than the acquisition of novel behaviors. We compared tunnel formation between two closely related species, Reticulitermes tibialis and Heterotermes aureus, and found that H. aureus builds more highly branched tunnels than R. tibialis. Our behavioral analysis and data-based modeling revealed that these species share the same behavioral repertoire, but a quantitative difference in the probability of sidewall excavation leads to diverse tunneling patterns. In contrast, we also found that Paraneotermes simplicicornis, which evolved tunneling independently, possesses a distinct behavioral repertoire, but shows convergence of branching patterns with R. tibialis. These results elucidate the complex relationship between individual behavior and group-level patterns; in some cases, distinct behavioral rules can produce similar group-level patterns, but in others, a common rule set can yield distinct patterns via parameter tuning. The evolutionary process of collective behavior is flexible and much more complex than we can infer from group-level patterns alone.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic approaches have been used to identify sites where mutations are under purifying selection and of functional consequence by searching for sequences that are conserved across distantly related species. However, the performance of these approaches has not been rigorously evaluated under population genetic models. Further, short-lived functional elements may not leave a footprint of sequence conservation across many species. Here, we use simulations to study how one measure of conservation, the GERP score, relates to the strength of selection (Nes). We show that the GERP score is related to the strength of purifying selection. However, changes in selection coefficients or functional elements over time (i.e. functional turnover) can strongly affect the GERP distribution, leading to unexpected relationships between GERP and Nes. Further, we show that for functional elements that have a high turnover rate, the optimal tree size is not necessarily the largest possible tree, and more turnover reduces the optimal tree size. Finally, we use the distribution of GERP scores across the human genome to compare models with and without turnover of sites where mutations under purifying selection. We show that mutations in 4.51% of the noncoding human genome are under purifying selection and that most of this sequence has likely experienced changes in selection coefficients throughout mammalian evolution.",

    "abstract": "1A recurring problem in genomics involves testing association of one or more traits of interest to multiple genomic features. Feature-trait squared correlations r2 are commonly-used statistics, sensitive to trend associations. It is often of interest to perform testing across collections {r2} over markers and/or traits using both maxima and sums. However, both trait-trait correlations and marker-marker correlations may be strong and must be considered. The primary tools for multiple testing suffer from various shortcomings, including p-value inaccuracies due to asymptotic methods that may not be applicable. Moreover, there is a lack of general tools for fast screening and follow-up of regions of interest.To address these difficulties, we propose the MTCA approach, for Marker-Trait Complete Analysis. MTCA encompasses a large number of existing approaches, and provides accurate p-values over markers and traits for maxima and sums of r2 statistics. MTCA uses the conditional inference implicit in permutation as a motivational frame-work, but provides an option for fast screening with two novel tools: (i) a multivariate-normal approximation for the max statistic, and (ii) the concept of eigenvalue-conditional moments for the sum statistic. We provide examples for gene-based association testing of a continuous phenotype and cis-eQTL analysis, but MTCA can be applied in a much wider variety of settings and platforms.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells develop tactics to circumvent the interventions by desensitizing themselves to interventions. The principle routes of desensitization include a) activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and b) downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95/CD95L). As a result, it requires high therapeutic dose to achieve tumor regression which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral damaging effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs) in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing CSCs and cancer resistant cells (CRCs) which are shown to be responsible for high recurrence of disease and low patient survival. Here, we report several novel tumor targeted sensitizers derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001-003). The drug design is based on a novel concept \"A priori activation of apoptosis pathways of tumor technology (AAAPT) which is designed to activate specific cell death pathways and inhibit survival pathways simultaneously. Our results indicate that AMP-001-003 sensitize various types of cancer cells including MDA-MB-231 (triple negative breast cancer), PC3 (prostate cancer) and A543 (ling cancer) cells resulting in reducing the IC-50 of doxorubicin in vitro. At higher dose, AMP-001 acts as an anti-tumor agent on its own. The synergy between AMP-001 and doxorubicin could pave a new pathway to use AMP-001 as a neoadjuvant to chemotherapy to achieve a better efficacy and reduced off-target toxicity by the current treatments.\n\nSummary StatementA Priori Activation of Apoptosis Pathways of Tumor often referred to as \"AAAPT\" is a novel targeted tumor sensitizing technology which synergizes with chemotherapy to enhance the treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Principles of stable ecosystem organization are considered together with the role of abundant space, matter and energy in its maintenance. Life features the dichotomy of immotile (sessile, sedentary) organisms like plants, fungi, bacteria, on the one hand, versus organisms capable of active locomotion (animals) on the other. The immotile life can form a continuous live cover on the Earths surface. Since all available space is occupied, the immotile life does not experience an affluence of matter, energy and space itself. It turns out that this lack of abundance permits organization, on the basis of immotile organisms, of a stable ecosystem with a steady biomass. This live biomass comprises time-invariable genetic information about how to keep the environment in a stable state by controlling the degree of openness of nutrient cycles. Crucially, depending on their body size, energy and matter consumption by large animals exceed the area-specific fluxes of net primary production and its consumption in the immotile ecosystem by up to three orders of magnitude. The implication is that the herbivorous animals can meet their energy demands if and only if they move and destroy the live biomass of the immotile ecosystem. In consequence, if the immotile heterotrophs are replaced by locomotive heterotrophs, the ecosystem biomass experiences huge fluctuations and the ecosystem loses its capacity to maintain its favorable environment. From available theoretical and empirical evidence we conclude that lifes organization remains stable if the share of consumption by large animals is strictly limited, not exceeding about one per cent of ecosystem net primary production.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) bear great promise in understanding complex diseases and improving clinical diagnoses, but the competency of these risk scores in different populations is known to vary significantly, especially between those of European ancestry and those of other ethnic ancestries. Additionally, the applicability of these risk scores across populations different by disease, instead of ethnicity, is poorly understood. A current and largely unexplored population for the accuracy of PRS is that of individuals with autism. Combined with the increased prevalence of obesity in autistic populations, we seek to evaluate the difference in efficacy of PRS for obesity in autistic versus non-autistic populations. We show that genetic variants strongly associated with obesity in non-autistic populations are significantly less representative of the disease in autistic populations. Rather, these cases of obesity phenocopies in patients with autism may follow a different and non-conventional mechanism of action involving the regulation of oxytocin in the brain among other potential behavioral factors. Our findings elucidate the limits of PRS across populations contrasting by disease and suggest that obesity may be regulated differently in individuals with autism as compared to those without autism.",

    "abstract": "Bats account for ~20% of all extant mammal species and are considered exceptional given their extraordinary adaptations, including biosonar, true flight, extreme longevity, and unparalleled immune systems. To understand these adaptations, we generated reference-quality genomes of six species representing the key divergent lineages. We assembled these genomes with a novel pipeline incorporating state-of-the-art long-read and long-range sequencing and assembly techniques. The genomes were annotated using a maximal evidence approach, de novo predictions, protein/mRNA alignments, Iso-seq long read and RNA-seq short read transcripts, and gene projections from our new TOGA pipeline, retrieving virtually all (>99%) mammalian BUSCO genes. Phylogenetic analyses of 12,931 protein coding-genes and 10,857 conserved non-coding elements identified across 48 mammalian genomes helped to resolve bats closest extant relatives within Laurasiatheria, supporting a basal position for bats within Scrotifera. Genome-wide screens along the bat ancestral branch revealed (a) selection on hearing-involved genes (e.g LRP2, SERPINB6, TJP2), which suggest that laryngeal echolocation is a shared ancestral trait of bats; (b) selection (e.g INAVA, CXCL13, NPSR1) and loss of immunity related proteins (e.g. LRRC70, IL36G), including pro-inflammatory NF-kB signalling; and (c) expansion of the APOBEC family, associated with restricting viral infection, transposon activity and interferon signalling. We also identified unique integrated viruses, indicating that bats have a history of tolerating viral pathogens, lethal to other mammal species. Non-coding RNA analyses identified variant and novel microRNAs, revealing regulatory relationships that may contribute to phenotypic diversity in bats. Together, our reference-quality genomes, high-quality annotations, genome-wide screens and in-vitro tests revealed previously unknown genomic adaptations in bats that may explain their extraordinary traits.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of somatic DNA rearrangement junctions, many of which cannot be easily classified into simple (e.g. deletion, translocation) or complex (e.g. chromothripsis, chromoplexy) structural variant classes. Applying a novel genome graph computational paradigm to analyze the topology of junction copy number (JCN) across 2,833 tumor whole genome sequences (WGS), we introduce three complex rearrangement phenomena: pyrgo, rigma, and tyfonas. Pyrgo are \"towers\" of low-JCN duplications associated with early replicating regions and superenhancers, and are enriched in breast and ovarian cancers. Rigma comprise \"chasms\" of low-JCN deletions at late-replicating fragile sites in esophageal and other gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas. Tyfonas are \"typhoons\" of high-JCN junctions and fold back inversions that are enriched in acral but not cutaneous melanoma and associated with a previously uncharacterized mutational process of non-APOBEC kataegis. Clustering of tumors according to genome graph-derived features identifies subgroups associated with DNA repair defects and poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The study was undertaken to examine the response of ammonia oxidizing bacteria to different heavy metal salt in an elevated concentration. Surface soil samples at depth of 0-15 cm were collected at random from Akwa Ibom State University in Akwa Ibom State, soil sample from University of Nigeria, Nsukka and from solid waste disposal site in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. The response of heavy metal salt on Ammonia Oxidizing bacteria(AOB) isolated from soil samples were investigated by supplementing different heavy metal salts namely, copper(Cu),nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) at four loading rates(100,200,500,1000 {micro}g/ml) in mineral salt broth with Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) isolate. The cultures were incubated for 7 days. Growth of AOB was measured by withdrawing samples from the medium every 24 hours and absorbance of the turbidity measured at 600 nanometre using spectrophotometer. All bacteria showed high tendency to decrease optical density while increasing metal concentration in the medium. Tolerance for the metal ions was dependent on concentration, time and the isolate tested. All the Ammonia oxidizing bacterial (AOB) showed a high level of tolerance for the metals tested, and exhibited good growth at all metal salt concentrations tested. These make the nitrifying bacteria attractive potential candidates for further investigations regarding their ability to remove metals from contaminated soil.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe aim of this study is tolerance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria growth to heavy metal. Nitrifying bacteria remain a good option for bioremediation of soil and waste dump, since it is regarded as eco-friendly and efficient in biosorption of heavy metal.

    "abstract": "The archaellum is a unique motility structure that has only functional similarity to its bacterial counterpart, the flagellum. Archaellar filaments consist of thousands of copies of the protein protomer archaellin. Most euryarchaeal genomes encode multiple homologous archaellins. The role of these multiple archaellin genes remains unclear. Halophilic archaea from the genus Halorubrum possess two archaellin genes, flaB1 and flaB2. Amino acid sequences of the corresponding protein products are extraordinarily diverged (identity of [~] 40%). To clarify roles for each archaellin, we compared archaella from two natural Halorubrum lacusprofundi strains: the DL18 strain, which possesses both archaellin genes, and the type strain ACAM 34 whose genome contains the flaB2 gene only. Both strains synthesize functional archaella; however, the DL18 strain, where both archaellins are present in comparable amounts, is more motile. In addition, we expressed these different Hrr. lacusprofundi archaellins in a Haloferax volcanii strain from which the endogenous archaellin genes were deleted. Three Hfx. volcanii strains expressing Hrr. lacusprofundi archaellins flaB1, flaB2 or flaB1-flaB2 produced archaellum filaments consisting of only one (FlaB1 or FlaB2) or both (FlaB1/B2) archaellins. All three recombinant Hfx. volcanii strains were motile, although there were profound differences in the efficiency of motility. The recombinant filaments resemble the natural filaments of Hrr. lacusprofundi. Electron microscopy showed that FlaB1 FlaB2-archaella look like typical supercoiled filaments, while with the shape of the FlaB1- and FlaB2-archaella is more variable. Both native and recombinant FlaB1 FlaB2-filaments have greater thermal stability and are more resistant to low salinity stress than single-component filaments. This shows that thermal stability of archaellins depends on the presence of both archaellin types, indicating a close interaction between these subunits in the supramolecular structure. Functional helical Hrr. lacusprofundi archaella can be composed of either single archaellin: FlaB2 or FlaB1; however, the two divergent archaellin subunits in combination provide additional stabilization to the archaellum structure and thus adaptation to a wider range of external conditions. A comparative genomic analysis of archaellins suggests that the described combination of divergent archaellins is not restricted to Hrr. lacusprofundi, but is occurring also in organisms from other haloarchaeal genera.",

    "abstract": "Nascent RNA sequencing is a powerful method to measure transcription with high resolution, sensitivity, and directional information, which gives distinctive information about transcription from other methods such as chromatin immunoprecipitation or mRNA sequencing. We present an integrated package of nascent RNA-seq methods - ultrafast Precision Run On (uPRO) combined with computational procedures to discover cell type specific enhancers, promoters, and transcription factor networks. uPRO is composed of adaptor ligation and reverse transcription reactions, which is reduced to a one-day procedure and makes nascent RNA-seq more feasible and flexible for a widespread use. We generated genome-wide profiles of nascent transcription in human blood derived cell lines and clinical samples of ~1 ml of untreated whole blood. We integrated these data into deep learning and hierarchical network analysis to detect enhancers, promoters, and co-expression networks to define cell-type specific transcription programs. We found conservation of position but variation of expression in cell type specific enhancers and transcription start sites. Transcription factors (TFs) such as TCF-3 and OCT1 were pivotally associated with TF-enhancer-gene networks across cell types. Intriguingly, we also discovered that TFs related to cell stress and inflammation - such as SRF, ATF, CHOP, and NF-kB - are associated with inter-individual variation of leukocyte transcription in whole blood. Our integration of experimental and computational nascent RNA methods will provide an efficient strategy to identify specific transcriptional programs, both in cell-type and patient/disease-associated, with minimal sample requirements.",

These comparative transcriptomics studies showed that VelA regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in membrane transport, fungal cell wall biosynthesis, host cell wall degradation and secondary metabolism, along with a number of small secreted proteins and a large number of proteins with no predictable functions. In addition, these results were compared with previous transcriptomics experiments studying the impact of LaeA, another key global regulator of secondary metabolism and development that we have shown is important for the E. festucae- perennial ryegrass interaction.

    "abstract": "Network analysis of large-scale neuroimaging data has proven to be a particularly challenging computational problem. In this study, we adapt a novel analytical tool, known as the community dynamic inference method (CommDy), which was inspired by social network theory, for the study of brain imaging data from an aging mouse model. CommDy has been successfully used in other domains in biology; this report represents its first use in neuroscience. We used CommDy to investigate aging-related changes in network parameters in the auditory and motor cortices using flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging in brain slices and in vivo. Analysis of spontaneous activations in the auditory cortex of slices taken from young and aged animals demonstrated that cortical networks in aged brains were highly fragmented compared to networks observed in young animals. Specifically, the degree of connectivity of each activated node in the aged brains was significantly lower than those seen in the young brain, and multivariate analyses of all derived network metrics showed distinct clusters of these metrics in young vs. aged brains. CommDy network metrics were then used to build a random-forests classifier based on NMDA-receptor blockade data, which successfully recapitulated the aging findings, suggesting that the excitatory synaptic substructure of the auditory cortex may be altered during aging. A similar aging-related decline in network connectivity was also observed in spontaneous activity obtained from the awake motor cortex, suggesting that the findings in the auditory cortex are reflections of general mechanisms that occur during aging. Therefore, CommDy therefore provides a new dynamic network analytical tool to study the brain and provides links between network-level and synaptic-level dysfunction in the aging brain.",

    "abstract": "Denoising fMRI data requires assessment of frame-to-frame head motion and removal of the biases motion introduces. This is usually done through analysis of the parameters calculated during retrospective head motion correction (i.e.,  motion parameters). However, it is increasingly recognized that respiration introduces factitious head motion via perturbations of the main (B0) field. This effect appears as higher-frequency fluctuations in the motion parameters (> 0.1 Hz, here referred to as  HF-motion), primarily in the phase-encoding direction. This periodicity can sometimes be obscured in standard single-band fMRI (TR 2.0 - 2.5 s.) due to aliasing. Here we examined (1) how prevalent HF-motion effects are in seven single-band datasets with TR from 2.0 - 2.5 s and (2) how HF-motion affects functional connectivity. We demonstrate that HF-motion is relatively trait-like and more common in older adults, those with higher body mass index, and those with lower cardiorespiratory fitness. We propose a low-pass filtering approach to remove the contamination of high frequency effects from motion summary measures, such as framewise displacement (FD). We demonstrate that in most datasets this filtering approach saves a substantial amount of data from FD-based frame censoring, while at the same time reducing motion biases in functional connectivity measures. These findings suggest that filtering motion parameters is an effective way to improve the fidelity of head motion estimates, even in single band datasets. Particularly large data savings may accrue in datasets acquired in older and less fit participants.\n\nHighlights- Single-band fMRI motion traces show factitious high-frequency content (HF-motion)\n- The magnitude of HF-motion relates to age and other demographic factors\n- HF-motion elevates framewise displacement (FD) and causes data loss\n- Substantial fMRI data can be recovered from censoring by filtering motion traces\n- Filtering motion traces reduces motion artifacts in functional connectivity",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of brain function is necessary to understand neurocognitive ageing, and thereby promote health and well-being. Many studies of neurocognitive aging have investigated brain function with the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, the BOLD signal is a composite of neural and vascular signals, which are differentially affected by aging. It is therefore essential to distinguish the age effects on vascular versus neural function. The BOLD signal variability at rest (known as resting state fluctuation amplitude, RSFA), is a safe, scalable and robust means to calibrate vascular responsivity, as an alternative to breath-holding and hypercapnia. However, the use of RSFA for normalization of BOLD imaging assumes that age differences in RSFA reflecting only vascular factors, rather than age-related differences in neural function (activity) or neuronal loss (atrophy). Previous studies indicate that two vascular factors, cardiovascular health and cerebrovascular function, are insufficient when used alone to fully explain age-related differences in RSFA. It remains possible that their joint consideration is required to fully capture age differences in RSFA. We tested the hypothesis that RSFA no longer varies with age after adjusting for a combination of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular measures. We also tested the hypothesis that RSFA variation with age is not associated with atrophy. We used data from the population-based, lifespan Cam-CAN cohort. After controlling for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular estimates alone, the residual variance in RSFA across individuals was significantly associated with age. However, when controlling for both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular estimates, the variance in RSFA was no longer associated with age. Grey matter volumes did not explain age-differences in RSFA, after controlling for cardiovascular health. The results were consistent between voxel-level analysis and independent component analysis. Our findings indicate that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular signals are together sufficient predictors of age differences in RSFA. We suggest that RSFA can be used to separate vascular from neuronal factors, to characterise neurocognitive aging. We discuss the implications and make recommendations for the use of RSFA in the research of aging.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT / SUMMARYProstaglandins play fundamental roles in adipose tissue function. While prostaglandin F2 inhibits adipogenesis, prostaglandin E2 promotes adipose beiging. PGF2 and PGE2 are both inactivated through uptake by the plasma membrane transporter (PGT). We hypothesized that inhibiting PGT would increase PGF2 and PGE2 levels, thereby reducing white fat expansion and inducing beiging. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibiting PGT in mice on high fat diet via genetic knockout or pharmacological blockade reduced body fat stores and induced thermogenesis at thermoneutrality. Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of these mice exhibited robust UCP1-independent thermogenesis characterized by mitochondrial expansion, coupling of O2 consumption to ATP synthesis, and induction of the creatine pathway. Enhanced coupled respiration persisted in PGT-KO iWAT adipocytes in a creatine shuttle-dependent manner. Thus, inhibiting PGT increases mitochondrial biogenesis and coupled respiration--each supported by the creatine pathway in a system lacking UCP1 expression--revealing PGT as a promising drug target against obesity.",

    "abstract": "Receptor endocytosis is important for signal activation and transduction. However, how a receptor interprets conflicting signals to adjust cellular output is not clearly understood. During plant development, the family of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) peptides fine-tunes stomatal patterning through ERECTA-family receptor kinases. Using genetic, cell biological, and pharmacological approaches, we report here that ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1), the major receptor restricting stomatal differentiation, undergoes dynamic subcellular behaviors in response to different signal inputs. ERL1 is constitutively recycled, whereas its activation by EPF1 peptide induces rapid internalization to multivesicular bodies (MVB). In contrast, the dominant-negative ERL1 resides predominantly in plasma membrane. The co-receptor, TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM), is essential for EPF1-induced ERL1 internalization but dispensable for EPFL6-induced ERL1 internalization. The peptide antagonist of EPF1, Stomagen/EPFL9, triggers retention of ERL1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our study elucidates that multiple related yet unique peptides specify cell fate by deploying the differential subcellular dynamics of a single receptor.",

Uncovering these inter-kingdom cross-talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets. Despite the biological significance of microbe-host interactions, there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes. Computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating, integrating and prioritizing predictions - as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks. Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohns disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis.

Social evolution theory has highlighted the key role of relatedness in determining multicellular complexity and obligateness, however there is a need to extend this to a broader perspective incorporating the role of the environment. In this paper, we formally test Bonners 1998 hypothesis that the environment is crucial in determining the course of multicellular evolution, with aggregative multicellularity evolving more frequently on land and clonal multicellularity more frequently in water. Using a combination of scaling theory and phylogenetic comparative analyses, we describe multicellular organisational complexity across 139 species spanning 14 independent transitions to multicellularity and investigate the role of the environment in determining multicellular group formation and in imposing constraints on multicellular evolution. Our results, showing that the physical environment has impacted the way in which multicellular groups form, could shed light on the role of the environment for other major evolutionary transitions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Muhlemann et al. (2018) and Krause-Kyora et al. (2018) discovered 15 ancient Hepatitis B virus (aHBV) sequences dating back to the Neolithic age (NA) and the Bronze age (BA). Being published simultaneously, neither of these studies could include sequences from the other for analyses. In the present research, aHBV sequences from these studies were collective re-analysed with reference to a comprehensive database comprising extant HBV diversity to understand their relatedness and role in the evolution of extant HBV diversity. Present analyses revealed several interesting findings on distribution, dispersal, phylogenetic and recombinational relatedness of ancient HBV to extant genotypes, which were not recognized previously. Several interesting recombination patterns were observed, which corroborated well with ancient human migration, shown by the human genetic studies. Present analyses suggest that comparable to the replacement of the Neolithic European farmer associated Y chromosome haplogroups by haplogroups associated with the steppe people during Steppe migration, HBV genotype associated with the early Neolithic European farming cultures was also replaced by the ancestral HBV genotype A probably carried by the migrating steppe people, and a variant of this genotype is the prevalent HBV genotype in contemporary European populations. Additionally, based on recent literature, this research also indicates that HBV genotype divergence estimates proposed by Muhlemann et al., and others cannot sufficiently explain distribution of certain extant HBV genotypes. Hence, an alternative possibility to explain long distance and trans-oceanic distribution of phylogenetically related HBV genotypes was reviewed and discussed in the light of currently available knowledge. Through this manuscript, novel and important findings of the present analyses are communicated.",

    "abstract": "Congenital heart diseases (CHD), such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), are considered to have complex genetic underpinnings that are poorly understood. Here, an integrated multi-disciplinary approach was applied to identify novel genes and underlying mechanisms associated with HLHS. A family-based strategy was employed that coupled whole genome sequencing (WGS) with RNA sequencing of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a sporadic HLHS proband-parent trio to identify, prioritize and functionally evaluate candidate genes in model systems. Consistent with the hypoplastic phenotype, the probands iPSCs had reduced proliferation capacity. Filtering WGS for rare de novo, recessive, and loss-of-function variants revealed 10 candidate genes with recessive variants and altered expression compared to the parents iPSCs. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in generic human iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors and in the in vivo Drosophila heart model revealed that LDL receptor related protein LRP2 and apolipoprotein APOB are required for robust hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte proliferation and normal hear structure and function, possibly involving an oligogenic mechanism via growth-promoting WNT and SHH signaling. LRP2 was further validated as a CHD gene in a zebrafish heart model and rare variant burden testing in an HLHS cohort. Collectively, this cross-functional genetic approach to complex congenital heart disease revealed LRP2 dysfunction as a likely novel genetic driver of HLHS, and hereby established a scalable approach to decipher the oligogenic underpinnings of maladaptive left heart development.\n\nOne sentence summaryWhole genome sequencing and a multi-model system candidate gene validation - human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and Drosophila and zebrafish hearts - identified lipoprotein LRP2 as a new potential driver in congenital heart disease and suggests a deficit in proliferation as a hallmark of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.",

    "abstract": "An important problem in computational neuroscience is to understand how networks of spiking neurons can carry out various computations underlying behavior. Balanced spiking networks (BSNs) provide a powerful framework for implementing arbitrary linear dynamical systems in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons (Boerlin et al. [1]). However, the classic BSN model requires near-instantaneous transmission of spikes between neurons, which is biologically implausible. Introducing realistic synaptic delays leads to an pathological regime known as \"ping-ponging\", in which different populations spike maximally in alternating time bins, causing network output to overshoot the target solution. Here we document this phenomenon and provide a novel solution: we show that a network can have realistic synaptic delays while maintaining accuracy and stability if neurons are endowed with conditionally Poisson firing. Formally, we propose two alternate formulations of Poisson balanced spiking networks: (1) a \"local\" framework, which replaces the hard integrate-and-fire spiking rule within each neuron by a \"soft\" threshold function, such that firing probability grows as a smooth nonlinear function of membrane potential; and (2) a \"population\" framework, which reformulates the BSN objective function in terms of expected spike counts over the entire population. We show that both approaches offer improved robustness, allowing for accurate implementation of network dynamics with realistic synaptic delays between neurons. Moreover, both models produce positive correlations between similarly tuned neurons, a feature of real neural populations that is not found in the original BSN. This work unifies balanced spiking networks with Poisson generalized linear models and suggests several promising avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signaling molecule that plays an important role in neurovascular coupling. NO produced by neurons diffuses into the smooth muscle surrounding cerebral arterioles, driving vasodilation. However, the rate of NO degradation in hemoglobin is orders of magnitude higher than in brain tissue, though how this might impact NO signaling dynamics is not completely understood. We used simulations to investigate how the spatial and temporal patterns of NO generation and degradation impacted dilation of a penetrating arteriole in cortex. We found that the spatial location of NO production and the size of the vessel both played an important role in determining its responsiveness to NO. The much higher rate of NO degradation and scavenging of NO in the blood relative to the tissue drove emergent vascular dynamics. Large vasodilation events could be followed by post-stimulus constrictions driven by the increased degradation of NO by the blood, and vasomotion-like 0.1-0.3 Hz oscillations could also be generated. We found that these dynamics could be enhanced by elevation of free hemoglobin in the plasma, which occurs in diseases such as malaria and sickle cell anemia, or following blood transfusions. Finally, we show that changes in blood flow during hypoxia or hyperoxia could be explained by altered NO degradation in the parenchyma. Our simulations suggest that many common vascular dynamics may be emergent phenomenon generated by NO degradation by the blood or parenchyma.",

    "abstract": "The use of comparative genomics for functional, evolutionary, and epidemiological studies requires methods to classify gene families in terms of occurrence in a given species. These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and dont account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics. The software is freely available at https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN.\n\nAuthor summaryMicroorganisms have the greatest biodiversity and evolutionary history on earth. At the genomic level, it is reflected by a highly variable gene content even among organisms from the same species which explains the ability of microbes to be pathogenic or to grow in specific environments. We developed a new method called PPanGGOLiN which accurately represent the genomic diversity of a species (i.e. its pangenome) using a compact graph structure. Based on this pangenome graph, we classify genes by a statistical method according to their occurrence in the genomes. This method allowed us to build pangenomes even for uncultivated species at an unprecedented scale. We applied our method on all available genomes in databanks in order to depict the overall diversity of hundreds of species. Overall, our work enables microbiologists to explore and visualize pangenomes alike a subway map.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in various biological processes. Emerging evidence suggests that the interactions between lncRNAs and miRNAs play an important role in regulating of genes and the development of many diseases. Due to the limited scale of known lncRNA-miRNA interactions, and expensive time and labor costs for identifying them by biological experiments, more accurate and efficient lncRNA-miRNA interactions computational prediction approach urgently need to be developed. In this work, we proposed a novel computational method, GNMFLMI, to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions using graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization. More specifically, the similarities both lncRNA and miRNA are calculated based on known interaction information and their sequence information. Then, the affinity graphs for lncRNAs and miRNAs are constructed using the p-nearest neighbors, respectively. Finally, a graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization model is developed to accurately identify potential interactions between lncRNAs and miRNAs. To evaluate the performance of GNMFLMI, five-fold cross validation experiments are carried out. GNMFLMI achieves the AUC value of 0.9769 which outperforms the compared methods NMF and CNMF. In the case studies for lncRNA nonhsat159254.1 and miRNA hsa-mir-544a, 20 and 16 of the top-20 associations predicted by GNMFLMI are confirmed, respectively. Rigorous experimental results demonstrate that GNMFLMI can effectively predict novel lncRNA-miRNA interactions, which can provide guidance for relevant biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImagining ways to prevent or treat glioblastoma (GBM) have been hindered by a lack of understanding of its pathogenesis. Although PDGF-AA overexpression may be an early event, critical details of the core biology are lacking. Existing PDGF-driven models replicate its microscopic appearance but not the genomic architecture characteristic of the human disease. Here we report a new model of GBM that overcomes this barrier to authenticity.\n\nMethodsUsing a method developed to study neural stem cells, we investigated the effects of PDGF-AA on subventricular zone (SVZ) cells, the putative cell of origin of GBM. We micro-dissected SVZ tissue from p53-null and wild-type adult mice, established primary cultures in media supplemented with PDGF-AA, and assessed cell viability, proliferation, genome stability, and tumour forming potential.\n\nResultsCounterintuitive to its canonical role as a growth factor, we observed immediate and massive death of SVZ cells in PDGF-AA. Wild-type cells did not survive in PDGF-AA. However, a small fraction of null cells evaded apoptosis, displayed attenuated proliferation, gradually accumulated whole chromosome gains and losses, and, signalled by sudden rapid proliferation and growth factor independence, became tumorigenic in immune-competent syngeneic mice. Transformed cells had an OPC-like profile, were resistant to PDGFR- inhibition, and harboured highly abnormal karyotypes similar to those seen in human GBMs.\n\nConclusionThis model associates genome instability in SVZ cells with chronic exposure to PDGF-AA; it is the first model to replicate the genomic landscape of GBM and first in which the earliest phases of GBM can be directly observed.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF STUDYWe have developed a mouse model in which the initiation, evolution and genomic landscape of GBM can be thoroughly studied thus paving the way for ideas about how this deadly brain cancer might be prevented, interrupted at an occult stage, or treated with very different therapies.",

    "abstract": "The flightless beetle Merizodus soledadinus, originating from the Falkland Islands, was introduced to the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands. We compiled the existing information on ship visits and landings on these islands to confirm the introduction date of M. soledadinus. Using data available in the literature, in addition to collecting more than 2000 presence/absence records of M. soledadinus over the 1991-2018 period, we tracked changes of its abundance and geographical distribution. The range expansion of this nonflying insect was initially slow, but has accelerated over the past two decades in parallel to local increased abundances of the insects populations. Human activities may have facilitated colonization of some localities by M. soledadinus which is now widely present in the eastern part of the Kerguelen archipelago. This predatory insect represents a major threat for the native invertebrate fauna; in particular, the wingless flies Anatalanta aptera and Calycopteryx moseleyi which are locally displaced and/or eliminated by the beetle. If no control measures, let alone eradication, are practicable, it is essential to limit the transport of this invasive insect along with human activities. Since 2006, the Kerguelen Islands have had the status of a nature reserve, making these results of significant interests for the management of this archipelago, and more generally, emphasizing the importance of long-term biomonitoring programmes for assessing and predicting changes in the distribution of invasive organisms. Strict biosecurity measures have now been established at the Kerguelen Islands, with even greater attention paid to visits to remote sites not yet colonized by M. soledadinus.",

    "abstract": "The kinetochore complex is a conserved machinery that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules. During meiosis, the kinetochore is restructured to accommodate a specialized chromosome segregation pattern. In budding yeast, meiotic kinetochore remodeling is mediated by the temporal changes in the abundance of a single subunit called Ndc80. We have previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APCAma1 and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N-terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which meiotic cells modulate their kinetochore composition through regulated Ndc80 degradation, and demonstrates that Aurora B-dependent regulation of kinetochores extends beyond altering microtubule attachments.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences have been shown in laboratory biomarkers; however, the extent to which this is due to genetics is unknown. In this study, we infer sex-specific genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlation) across 33 quantitative biomarker traits in 181,064 females and 156,135 males from the UK Biobank study. We apply a Bayesian mixture model, Sex Effects Mixture Model, to Genome-wide Association Study summary statistics in order to (1) estimate the contributions of sex to the genetic variance of these biomarkers and (2) identify variants whose statistical association with these traits is sex-specific. We find that the genetics of most biomarker traits are shared between males and females, with the notable exception of testosterone, where we identify 119 female and 444 male-specific variants. These include protein-altering variants in steroid hormone production genes (POR, CYP3A43, UGT2B7). Using the sex-specific variants as genetic instruments for Mendelian Randomization, we find evidence for causal links between testosterone levels and height, body mass index, waist circumference, and type 2 diabetes. We also show that sex-specific polygenic risk score models for testosterone outperform a combined model. Overall, these results demonstrate that while sex has a limited role in the genetics of most biomarker traits, sex plays an important role in testosterone genetics.",

    "abstract": "With the significant improvement of human civilization there is a spur in the urban, rural and industrial development, which has a profound effect on the surrounding natural environment. Increased utilization of natural resources is often associated with accumulation of waste materials whose management is crucial for sustainable development of life. Availability of different microorganisms in the soil facilitates the degradation of wastes through their potential enzymatic activities. Pectinase seems to be one of the important enzymes produced by a wide variety of microorganisms contained in the soil. It is mainly involved in maceration and rotting of plant extracts and debris by hydrolysis of 1,4-alpha glycosidic bonds of de-esterified pectate of plant call wall. In this paper we report molecular identification of some pectinase producing Aspergillus species selected from soil samples of five different zones of Bhubaneswar city using molecular biology and computational techniques. Among fifteen fungal isolates studied from these five zones Aspergillus parvisclerotigenus was potent for pectinase production next to Aspergillus niger in form of halozone of 0.6 mm. Its 28S rDNA sequence also had some significant identity (>90%) with different subspecies of Aspergillus. We hope that our findings will helpful in genetic manipulation for improvement of fungal strains of isolates. Again large scale use of the improved Aspergillus strains can degrade plant biomass & diverse industrial wastes which will reduce environmental pollution of capital urban like Bhubaneswar.",

    "abstract": "In everyday life, our behavior varies on a continuum from automatic and habitual to deliberate and goal-directed. Recent evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is an open question how one can computationally model the brains balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for control of a partially observable Markov decision process that enables conjoint learning of habits and reward structure in a context-specific manner. In this model, habit learning corresponds to an updating of priors over policies and interacts with the learning of the outcome contingencies. Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic inference, which effectively provides a simple explanation of how the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed control. We illustrated the resulting behavior using agent-based simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of devaluation, extinction, and renewal experiments, as well as the so-called two-step task which is typically used with human participants. In addition, we show how a single parameter, the habitual tendency, can explain individual differences in habit learning and the balancing between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss the link of the proposed model to other habit learning models and implications for understanding specific phenomena in substance use disorder.",

At the same time, increased experimental throughput has facilitated the study of larger numbers of experimental conditions. While methods for analysing single-cell data that model the resulting structure of either of these dimensions are beginning to emerge, current methods do not account for complex experimental designs that include both multiple views (modalities or assays) and groups (conditions or experiments). Here we present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2 (MOFA+), a statistical framework for the comprehensive and scalable integration of structured single cell multi-modal data. MOFA+ builds upon a Bayesian Factor Analysis framework combined with fast GPU-accelerated stochastic variational inference. Similar to existing factor models, MOFA+ allows for interpreting variation in single-cell datasets by pooling information across cells and features to reconstruct a low-dimensional representation of the data. Uniquely, the model supports flexible group-level sparsity constraints that allow joint modelling of variation across multiple groups and views.\\n\\nTo illustrate MOFA+, we applied it to single-cell data sets of different scales and designs, demonstrating practical advantages when analyzing datasets with complex group and/or view structure. In a multi-omics analysis of mouse gastrulation this joint modelling reveals coordinated changes between gene expression and epigenetic variation associated with cell fate commitment.",

In cancer, non-self HLA-I ligands can arise from many different alterations, including non-synonymous mutations, gene fusion, cancer-specific alternative mRNA splicing or aberrant post-translational modifications. Identifying HLA-I ligands remains a challenging task that requires either heavy experimental work for in-vivo identification or optimized bioinformatics tools for accurate predictions. To date, no HLA-I ligand predictor includes post-translational modifications. To fill this gap, we curated phosphorylated HLA-I ligands from several immunopeptidomics studies (including six newly measured samples) covering 72 HLA-I alleles, and retrieved a total of 2,066 unique phosphorylated peptides. We then expanded our motif deconvolution tool to identify precise binding motifs of phosphorylated HLA-I ligands. Our results reveal a clear enrichment of phosphorylated peptides among HLA-C ligands and demonstrate a prevalent role of both HLA-I motifs and kinase motifs on the presentation of phosphorylated peptides. This data further enabled us to develop and validate the first predictor of interactions between HLA-I molecules and phosphorylated peptides.",

    "abstract": "Many naturally-occurring bacteria lead a lifestyle of metabolic dependency, i.e., they depend on others for crucial resources. We do not understand what factors drive bacteria towards this lifestyle, and how. Here, we systematically show that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a crucial role in the evolution of dependencies in bacteria. Across 835 bacterial species, we map gene gain-loss dynamics on a deep evolutionary tree, and assess the impact of HGT and gene loss on bacterial metabolic networks. Our analyses suggest that genes acquired by HGT can affect which genes are later lost. Dependency evolution is contingent on earlier HGT because of two reasons. First, we find that HGT typically adds new catabolic routes to bacterial metabolic networks. This increases the chance of new metabolic interactions between bacteria, which is a prerequisite for dependency evolution. Second, we show that gaining new routes can promote the loss of specific ancestral routes (a mechanism we call \"coupled gains and losses\", CGLs). Phylogenetic patterns indicate that both types of dependencies -- those mediated by CGLs and those purely by gene loss -- are equally likely. Our results highlight HGT as an important driver of metabolic dependency evolution in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe abyssal seafloor covers more than 50% of planet Earth and is a large reservoir of still mostly undescribed biodiversity. It is increasingly under target of resource-extraction industries although being drastically understudied. In such remote and hard-to-access ecosystems, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a useful and efficient tool for studying biodiversity and implementing environmental impact assessments. Yet, eDNA analysis outcomes may be biased towards describing past rather than present communities as sediments contain both contemporary and ancient DNA.\nC_LIO_LIUsing commercially available kits, we investigated the impacts of five molecular processing methods on DNA metabarcoding biodiversity inventories targeting prokaryotes (16S-V4V5), unicellular eukaryotes (18S-V4), and metazoans (18S-V1, COI). As the size distribution of ancient DNA is skewed towards small fragments, we evaluated the effect of removing short DNA fragments via size-selection and ethanol reconcentration using DNA extracted from 10 g of sediment at five deep-sea sites. We also compare communities revealed by DNA and RNA co-extracted from 2 g of sediment at the same sites.\nC_LIO_LIResults show that removing short DNA fragments does not affect alpha and beta diversity estimates in any of the biological compartments investigated. Results also confirm doubts regarding the possibility to better describe live communities using environmental RNA (eRNA). With ribosomal loci, RNA, while resolving similar spatial patterns than co-extracted DNA, resulted in significantly higher richness estimates, supporting hypotheses of increased persistence of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the environment and unmeasured bias due to over-abundance of rRNA and RNA release. With the mitochondrial locus, RNA detected lower metazoan richness and resolved less spatial patterns than co-extracted DNA, reflecting high messenger RNA lability. Results also highlight the importance of using large amounts of sediment ([&ge;]10 g) for accurately surveying eukaryotic diversity.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that DNA should be favoured over RNA for logistically realistic, repeatable, and reliable surveys, and confirm that large sediment samples ([&ge;]10 g) deliver more complete and accurate assessments of benthic eukaryotic biodiversity and that increasing the number of biological rather than technical replicates is important to infer robust ecological patterns.\nC_LI",

To investigate the factors that contribute to this inefficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to transport, we characterized the structures and functions of variants of the bacterial Atm1 homolog from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (NaAtm1), including forms with disulfide crosslinks between the nucleotide binding domains. Unexpectedly, disulfide crosslinked variants of NaAtm1 reconstituted into proteoliposomes not only transported oxidized glutathione, but also exhibited more efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis to GSSG transport than the native transporter. These observations suggest that enhanced conformational dynamics of reconstituted NaAtm1 may contribute to the inefficient use of ATP. Understanding the origins of this uncoupled ATPase activity, and reducing the impact through disulfide crosslinking or other protocols, will be critical for the detailed dissection of ABC transporter mechanism to assure that the ATP dependent steps are indeed relevant to substrate translocation.",

I found that the kinetic hypothesis accurately predicts the upper bound of the relationship between the inverse of mean annual temperature (1/kK) and the natural logarithm of species richness, at a broad scale. In addition, I found that water availability and the number of days with freezing temperatures organize a part of the residual variation of the upper bound model. The finding of the model fitting on the upper bound rather than on the mean values suggest that the kinetic hypothesis is modeling the variation of the potential maximum species richness per unit of temperature. Likewise, the distribution of the residuals of the upper bound model in function of the number of days with freezing temperatures suggest the importance of environmental thresholds rather than gradual variation driving the observable variation in species richness.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiota (HGM) are closely associated with health, development and disease. The thick intestinal mucus layer, especially in the colon, is the key barrier between the contents of the lumen and the epithelial cells, providing protection against infiltration by the microbiota as well potential pathogens. The upper layer of the colonic mucus is a niche for a subset of the microbiota which utilise the mucin glycoproteins as a nutrient source and mucin grazing by the microbiota appears to play a key role in maintaining barrier function as well as community stability. Despite the importance of mucin breakdown for gut health, the mechanisms by which gut bacteria access this complex glycoprotein are not well understood. The current model for mucin degradation involves exclusively exo-acting glycosidases that sequentially trim monosaccharides from the termini of the glycan chains to eventually allow access to the mucin peptide backbone by proteases. However, this model is in direct contrast to the Sus paradigm of glycan breakdown used by the Bacteroidetes which involves extracellular cleavage of glycans by surface located endo-acting enzymes prior to import of the oligosaccharide products. Here we describe the discovery and characterisation of endo-acting family 16 glycoside hydrolases (GH16s) from prominent mucin degrading gut bacteria that specifically target the oligosaccharide side chains of intestinal mucins from both animals and humans. These endo-acting O-glycanases display {beta}1,4-glactosidase activity and in several cases are surface located indicating they are involved in the initial step in mucin breakdown. The data suggest a new paradigm for mucin breakdown by the microbiota and the endo-mucinases provide a potential tool to explore changes that occur in mucin structure in intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.",

We perform genome-wide cis-eQTL mapping using admixed samples in six tissues, adjusted by either global or local ancestry. Consistent with previous work, we observe improved power with local ancestry adjustment. At loci where the two adjustments produce different lead variants, we observe only 0.8% of tests with GWAS colocalization posterior probabilities that change by 10% or more. Notably, both adjustments produce similar numbers of significant colocalizations. Finally, we identify a small subset of GTEx v8 eQTL-associated variants highly correlated with local ancestry (R2 > 0.7), providing a resource to enhance functional follow-up.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide a local ancestry map for admixed individuals in the final GTEx release and describe the impact of ancestry and admixture on gene expression, eQTLs, and GWAS colocalization. While the majority of results are concordant between local and global ancestry-based adjustments, we identify distinct advantages and disadvantages to each approach.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of giant viruses with large genomes has transformed our understanding of the limits of viral complexity in the biosphere, and subsequent research in model virus-host systems has advanced our knowledge of intricate mechanisms used by these viruses to take over host cells during infection. The extent of the metabolic diversity encoded by these viruses in the environment is less well-understood, however, and their potential impact on global biogeochemical cycles remains unclear. To address this, we generated 501 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of NCLDVs from diverse environments around the globe and analyzed their encoded functional diversity and potential for reprogramming host physiology. We found that 476 (95%) of the MAGs belonged to the Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae families, and of these we recovered 96% from aquatic environments, highlighting the diversity of these viral families in global freshwater and marine systems. MAGs encoded diverse genes predicted to be involved in nutrient uptake and processing, light harvesting, central nitrogen metabolism, and the manipulation of cell death, underscoring the complex interplay between these viruses and their hosts. Surprisingly, numerous genomes encoded genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the TCA cycle, including one genome with a 70%-complete glycolytic pathway, suggesting that many of these viruses can even reprogram fundamental aspects of their hosts central carbon metabolism. Phylogenetic trees of NCLDV metabolic genes together with their cellular homologs revealed distinct clustering of viral sequences into divergent clades, indicating these metabolic genes are virus-specific and were acquired in the distant past. Our findings reveal that diverse NCLDV genomes encode complex, cell-like metabolic capabilities with evolutionary histories that are largely independent of cellular life, strongly implicating them as distinct drivers of biogeochemical cycles in their own right.",

    "abstract": "Darunavir (DRV) is exceptional among potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) in the high drug concentrations that are achived in vivo. Little is known about the de novo resistance pathway for DRV. We have selected for resistance to high drug concentrations against ten PIs and their structural precursor DRV. Mutations accumulated through two pathways (anchored by protease mutations I50V or I84V). Small chemical changes in the inhibitor P1 side chain led to preferential use of one pathway over the other. Changes in the inhbitor P2 side chain determined differences in potency that were retained in the resistant viruses. Viral variants from the two pathways showed differential selection of compensatory mutations in Gag cleavage sites. These results reveal the high level of selective pressure that is attainable with fourth generation PIs, and how features of the inhibitor affect both the resistance pathway and the residual potency in the face of resistance.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) contributes to HIV-1 RNA binding, which is required for viral maturation. Non-catalytic site integrase inhibitors (NCINIs) have been developed as allosteric IN inhibitors, which perform anti-HIV-1 activity by disrupting IN multimerization. Here, we show that IN undergoes a novel conformational alteration to escape from NCINIs. We observed that NCINI-resistant HIV-1 variants have accumulated amino acid (AA) mutations in the IN-encoding region. We employed HPLC and thermal stability assays to show that the AA mutations affect the folding and dimerization interface of the IN catalytic core domains, resulting in severely decreased multimerization of full-length IN proteins (IN under-multimerization). The under-multimerization of IN was finally restored by HIV-1 RNA in the viral particles. Our study demonstrates that HIV-1 countervails NCINIs by IN under-multimerization as a novel escape mechanism. Our findings provide information on the understanding of IN multimerization and influence the development of unique anti-HIV-1 strategies.",

    "abstract": "Complex neurological conditions can give rise to large scale transcriptomic changes that drive disease progression. It is likely that alterations in one or a few transcription factors or cofactors underlie these transcriptomic alterations. Identifying the driving transcription factors/cofactors is a non-trivial problem and a limiting step in the understanding of neurological disorders. Epilepsy has a prevalence of 1% and is the fourth most common neurological disorder. While a number of anti-seizure drugs exist to treat seizures symptomatically, none is curative or preventive. This reflects a lack of understanding of disease progression. We used a novel systems approach to mine transcriptome profiles of rodent and human epileptic brain samples to identify regulators of transcriptional networks in the epileptic brain. We find that Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) regulates differentially expressed genes in epilepsy across multiple rodent models of acquired epilepsy. EZH2 undergoes a prolonged upregulation in the epileptic brain. A transient inhibition of EZH2 immediately after seizure induction robustly increases spontaneous seizure burden weeks later. Thus, EZH2 upregulation is a protective response mounted after a seizure. These findings are the first to characterize a role for EZH2 in opposing epileptogenesis and debut a bioinformatic approach to identify nuclear drivers of complex transcriptional changes in disease.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder and has been described since the time of Hippocrates. Despite this, no treatments exist to stop epilepsy progression. This is fundamentally due to the complex nature of the disease. Epilepsy is associated with hundreds if not thousands of gene expression changes in the brain that are likely driven by a few key master regulators called transcription factors and cofactors. Finding the aberrantly acting factors is a complex problem that currently lacks a satisfactory solution. We used a novel datamining tool to define key master regulators of gene expression changes across multiple epilepsy models and patient samples. We find that a nuclear enzyme, EZH2, regulates a large number of genes in the rodent and patient epileptic brain and that its function is protective. Thus, inhibiting EZH2 greatly exacerbates seizure burden. This is the first report of a novel datamining tool to define drivers of large-scale gene changes and is also the first report of EZH2 induction as an endogenous protective response in the epilepsy.",
