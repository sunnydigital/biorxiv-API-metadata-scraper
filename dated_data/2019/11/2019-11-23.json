    "abstract": "Task-related activity in the ventral thalamus, a major target of basal ganglia output, is often assumed to be permitted or triggered by changes in basal ganglia activity through gating- or rebound-like mechanisms. To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus, GPi, and ventrolateral-anterior nucleus, VLa) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously-recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-timescale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: Simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.",

    "abstract": "Cells in largely non-mitotic tissues such as the brain are prone to stochastic (epi-)genetic alterations that may cause increased variability between cells and individuals over time. Although increased inter-individual heterogeneity in gene expression was previously reported, whether this process starts during development or if it is restricted to the aging period has not yet been studied. The regulatory dynamics and functional significance of putative aging-related heterogeneity are also unknown. Here we address these by a meta-analysis of 19 transcriptome datasets from diverse human brain regions. We observed a significant increase in inter-individual heterogeneity during aging (20+ years) compared to postnatal development (0 to 20 years). Increased heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different brain regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation and neuronal functions. Overall, our results show that increased expression heterogeneity is a characteristic of aging human brain, and may influence aging-related changes in brain functions.",

    "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp; also known as MDR1 or ABCB1) is an ATP-driven multidrug transporter that extrudes various hydrophobic toxic compounds to the extracellular space. P-gp consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the substrate translocation pathway and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP. P-gp takes at least two states during transport; the inward-facing (pre-drug transport) conformation, in which the two NBDs are separated and the two TMDs are open to the intracellular side, and the outward-facing (post-drug transport) conformation, in which the NBDs are dimerized and the TMDs are slightly open to the extracellular side. ATP binding and hydrolysis cause conformational changes between the inward-facing and the outward-facing conformations to translocate substrates across the membrane. However, it remains unclear how ATP is used during these conformational changes in living cells. In this study, we investigated the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis during the conformational changes of human P-gp in living cells by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We show that ATP binding causes the conformational change to the outward-facing state and that ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of {gamma}-phosphate from both NBDs allow the outward-facing state to return to the original inward-facing state.",

    "abstract": "Evolution is a blind fitting process by which organisms, over generations, adapt to the niches of an ever-changing environment. Does the mammalian brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in training deep neural networks has exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights to map millions of observations along ecologically relevant objective functions. This class of models has dramatically outstripped simpler, more intuitive models, operating robustly in real-life contexts spanning perception, language, and action coordination. These models do not learn an explicit, human-interpretable representation of the underlying structure of the data; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Furthermore, counterintuitively, over-parameterized models, similarly to evolutionary processes, can be simple and parsimonious as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. In contrast to traditional scientific models, where the ultimate goal is interpretability, over-parameterized models eschew interpretability in favor of solving real-life problems or tasks. We contend that over-parameterized blind fitting presents a radical challenge to many of the underlying assumptions and practices in computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. At the same time, this shift in perspective informs longstanding debates and establishes unexpected links with evolution, ecological psychology, and artificial life.",

    "abstract": "1Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically-gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed.\n\nHere we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins.",

It has been used in a wide range of behavioral and ecological studies. This species pronounced morphological and behavioral diversity across populations makes it a favorable candidate in several areas of biomedical research. We have generated a high-quality de novo genome assembly of M. melodia using Illumina short read sequences from genomic and in vitro proximity-ligation libraries. The assembled genome is 978.3 Mb, with a coverage of 24.9x, N50 scaffold size of 5.6 Mb and N50 contig size of 31.7 Kb. Genes within our genome assembly are largely complete, with 87.5% full-length genes present out of a set of 4,915 universal single-copy orthologs present in most avian genomes. We annotated our genome assembly and constructed 15,086 gene models, a majority of which have high homology to related birds, Taeniopygia guttata and Junco hyemalis. In total, 83% of the annotated genes are assigned with putative functions. Furthermore, only ~7% of the genome is found to be repetitive; these regions and other non-coding functional regions are also identified. The high-quality M. melodia genome assembly and annotations we report will serve as a valuable resource for facilitating studies on genome structure and evolution that can contribute to biomedical research and serve as a reference in population genomic and comparative genomic studies of closely related species.",

We explore the mutational landscape of FH in silico, predict the functional effects of many already detected mutations, and categorise detected but un-characterised mutations in human populations. Using mutational energy predicting tools such as Rosetta and FoldX we accurately predict mutations and mutational hotspots with high disruptive capability. Furthermore, through performing molecular dynamics simulations we show that hinge regions of the protein can be stabilized or destabilized by mutations, with new mechanistic implications of the consequences on the binding affinity of the enzyme for its substrates. Finally, we categorise all potential mutations in FH into functional groups, and predict which known mutations in the human population are loss-of-function, and therefore predispose patients to papillary renal carcinoma - we validate our findings through analysis of metabolomics data of characterized cell lines.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDBrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for the extinction of drug-seeking. Expression of the Bdnf gene is highly regulated via interactions with non-coding RNA, which themselves are altered following drug exposure. Here we investigate whether a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to Bdnf prevents extinction of drug-seeking. METHODS: Strand-specific RNA sequencing identified a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to exon IV of the Bdnf gene in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of 8 adult male rats. We then assessed asBdnf-IV expression using strand-specific reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction following acquisition, extinction or abstinence from intravenous nicotine self-administration (N = 116). A functional role of the asBdnf-IV in extinction of nicotine-seeking was established by infusing gapmer oligonucleotides into the infralimbic cortex prior to extinction and testing for the effect of these infusions on reinstatement and reacquisition of nicotine-seeking (N = 36).\n\nRESULTSRNA sequencing identified the presence of a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to exon IV of the Bdnf gene (asBdnf-IV). Expression of asBdnf-IV was elevated following intravenous nicotine self-administration but not experimenter-administered nicotine. Elevated asBdnf-IV persisted across abstinence and to a greater extent following extinction training, suggesting an interaction between abstinence and extinction learning. In support of this, knockdown of the asBdnf-IV across extinction, but not abstinence, significantly attenuated nicotine-primed reinstatement of nicotine-seeking.\n\nCONCLUSIONSasBdnf-IV accumulates in the infralimbic cortex across self-administration training, interferes with the inhibitory learning that underpins extinction of drug-seeking, and predisposes animals to drug relapse.",

    "abstract": "Pioneer factors such as Zelda help initiate zygotic transcription in Drosophila early embryos, but whether other factors support this dynamic process is unclear. Odd-paired (Opa), a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed at cellularization, controls transition of genes from pair-rule to segmental patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. Finding that Opa also regulates late expression through enhancer sog_Distal, along the dorso-ventral axis, we hypothesized that Opa acts as a general timing factor. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) confirmed Opa in vivo binding to sog_Distal but also identified widespread binding throughout the genome, comparable to Zelda. Furthermore, chromatin assays (ATAC-seq) demonstrate that Opa, like Zelda, influences chromatin accessibility genome-wide, suggesting both are pioneer factors with common as well as distinct targets. Lastly, embryos lacking opa exhibit widespread, late patterning defects spanning both axes. Collectively, these data suggest Opa, a general timing factor and likely a late-acting pioneer factor, heralds in a secondary wave of zygotic gene expression.",

In the wild, river-dwelling populations (surface fish) consume plants and insects throughout the year, while cave-dwelling populations (cavefish) live in a perpetually dark environment and depend on nutrient-poor food brought in by bats or seasonal floods. We found that multiple cave populations converged on a reduced number of digestive appendages called pyloric caeca and that some cave populations have a lengthened gut while others have a shortened gut. Moreover, we identified differences in how gut morphology and proliferation respond to diet between surface fish and cavefish. Using a combination of quantitative genetic mapping, population genetics, and RNA sequencing, we found that changes to the molecular and genetic pathways that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune system function may underlie evolution of the cavefish gut.",

    "abstract": "Mutual information is widely used to characterize dependence between biological signals, such as co-expression between genes or co-evolution between amino acids. However, measurement error of the biological signals is rarely considered in estimating mutual information. Measurement error is widespread and non-negligible in some cases. As a result, the distribution of the signals is blurred, and the mutual information may be biased when estimated using the blurred measurements. We derive a corrected estimator for mutual information that accounts for the distribution of measurement error. Our corrected estimator is based on the correction of the probability mass function (PMF) or probability density function (PDF, based on kernel density estimation). We prove that the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased in the (semi-) discrete case when the distribution of measurement error is known. We show that it reduces the estimation bias in the continuous case under certain assumptions. On simulated data, our corrected estimator leads to a more accurate estimation for mutual information when the sample size is not the limiting factor for estimating PMF or PDF accurately. We compare the uncorrected and corrected estimator on the gene expression data of TCGA breast cancer samples and show a difference in both the value and the ranking of estimated mutual information between the two estimators.",

    "abstract": "Determining how microtubules (MTs) are nucleated is essential for understanding how the cytoskeleton assembles. While the MT nucleator, {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}-TuRC) has been identified, precisely how {gamma}-TuRC nucleates a MT remains poorly understood. Here we developed a single molecule assay to directly visualize nucleation of a MT from purified Xenopus laevis {gamma}-TuRC. We reveal a high {gamma}-/{beta}-tubulin affinity, which facilitates assembly of a MT from {gamma}-TuRC. Whereas spontaneous nucleation requires assembly of 8 {beta}-tubulins, nucleation from {gamma}-TuRC occurs efficiently with a cooperativity of 4 {beta}-tubulin dimers. This is distinct from pre-assembled MT seeds, where a single dimer is sufficient to initiate growth. A computational model predicts our kinetic measurements and reveals the rate-limiting transition where laterally-associated {beta}-tubulins drive {gamma}-TuRC into a closed conformation. Putative activation domain of CDK5RAP2, NME7 and TPX2 do not enhance {gamma}-TuRC-mediated nucleation, while XMAP215 drastically increases the nucleation efficiency by strengthening the longitudinal {gamma}-/{beta}-tubulin interaction.",

TRiP-OE stocks express sgRNAs targeting upstream of a gene transcription start site. Gene activation is triggered by co-expression of catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to an activator domain, either VP64-p65-Rta (VPR) or Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM). TRiP-KO stocks express one or two sgRNAs targeting the coding sequence of a gene or genes, allowing for generation of indels in both germline and somatic tissue. To date, we have generated more than 5,000 CRISPR-OE or -KO stocks for the community. These resources provide versatile, transformative tools for gene activation, gene repression, and genome engineering.",

    "abstract": "Domestication of Salmo salar has imposed strong selection for production traits since the 1970s. The domestication has also imposed a radical shift in diet. Whereas wild salmon eats invertebrates, crustaceans and fish, the dietary lipids in domestic feed has since 1990 gradually shifted from fish oil (FO) to vegetable oil (VO), causing a decrease intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). We tested the hypothesis that this shift has induced domestication-specific features of lipid metabolism in a 96-day feeding trial of domesticated and wild salmon fed diets based on FO, VO or phospholipids (PL). We addressed this by sampling tissues central in fat uptake (pyloric caeca) and processing (liver) and quantifying RNA expression and fatty acid composition. Domesticated salmon grew faster than wild salmon, with higher gene expression in glucose and lipid metabolism pathways. The promoters of differentially expressed genes were enriched for transcription factors involved in circadian clock regulation. Domesticated salmon had lower expression of cry2 and nr1d1, genes involved in negative regulation of circadian rhythm, with possible implications for the diurnal cycle of feed ingestion and basal metabolic rate. Only wild salmon showed a significant impact on growth of VO versus PL or FO feed, whereas domesticated but not wild salmon upregulated key LC-PUFA synthesis genes fads2d5 and fads2d6a in response to VO diet. Domesticated salmon had higher LC-PUFA but lower 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 in liver when fed VO, suggesting that domesticated salmon can better compensate for dietary shortage of LC-PUFA compared to wild salmon.",

In recent years, Finding an efficient technique for integrating discriminate features have been received advancing attention. In this study, we integrate Auto-Cross-Covariance (ACC) and Separated dimer (SD) evolutionary feature extraction methods.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic inheritance, especially its biomedical and evolutionary significance, is an immensely interesting but highly controversial subject. Notably, a recent analysis of existing multi-omics has supported the mechanistic plausibility of epigenetic inheritance and its implications in disease and evolution. The evolutionary support stemmed from the specific finding that genes associated with cold induced inheritance and with latitudinal adaptation in mice are exceptionally common. Here, a similar gene set overlap analysis is presented that integrates cold induced inheritance with evolutionary adaptation and genetic canalization in cold environment in Drosophila. Genes showing differential expression in inheritance specifically overrepresent gene sets associated with differential and allele specific expression, though not with genome-wide genetic differentiation, in adaptation. On the other hand, the differentiated outliers uniquely overrepresent genes dysregulated by radicicol, a decanalization inducer. Both gene sets in turn exclusively show enrichment of genes that accumulate, in intended experimental lines, de novo mutations, a potential source of canalization. Successively, the three gene sets distinctively overrepresent genes exhibiting, between mutation accumulation lines, invariable expression, a potential signal for canalization. Sequentially, the four gene sets solely display enrichment of genes grouped in gene ontology under transcription factor activity, a signature of regulatory canalization. Cumulatively, the analysis suggests that epigenetic inheritance possibly contributes to evolutionary adaptation in the form of cis regulatory variations, with trans variations arising in the course of genetic canalization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdipogenesis, the process whereby preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes, is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Cholesterol lowering statins increase type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk possibly by affecting adipogenesis and insulin resistance but the (epi)genetic mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we characterised the effects of statin treatment on adipocyte differentiation using in vitro human preadipocytes cell model to identify putative effective genes.\n\nResultsStatin treatment during adipocyte differentiation caused a reduction in key genes involved in adipogenesis, such as ADIPOQ, GLUT4 and ABCG1. Using Illuminas Infinium  850K Methylation EPIC array, we found a significant hypomethylation of cg14566882, located in the promoter of the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene, in response to two types of statins (atorvastatin and mevastatin), which correlates with an increased HDAC9 mRNA expression. HDAC9 is a transcriptional repressor of the cholesterol efflux ABCG1 gene expression, which is epigenetically modified in obesity and prediabetic states. Thus, we assessed the putative impact of ABCG1 knockdown in mimicking the effect of statin in adipogenesis. ABCG1 KD reduced the expression of key genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin signalling and glucose uptake. In human blood cells from two cohorts, ABCG1 expression was impaired in response to statins, confirming that ABCG1 is in vivo targeted by these drugs.\n\nConclusionsWe identified an epigenetic link between adipogenesis and adipose tissue insulin resistance in the context of T2D risk associated with statin use, which has important implications as HDAC9 and ABCG1 are considered potential therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cells respond to the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through formation of focal adhesions (FAs), re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton and adjustment of cell contractility. These are energy-demanding processes, but a potential causality between mechanical cues (matrix stiffness) and cellular (energy) metabolism remains largely unexplored. Here, we culture human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on stiff (20 kPa) or soft (1 kPa) substrate and demonstrate that cytoskeletal reorganization and FA formation spreading on stiff substrates lead to a drop in intracellular ATP levels, correlates with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The resulting increase in ATP levels further facilitates cell spreading and reinforces cell tension of the steady state, and coincides with nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and Runx2. While on soft substrates (1 kPa), lowered ATP levels limit these cellular mechanoresponses. Furthermore, genetic ablation of AMPK lowered cellular ATP levels on stiff substrate and strongly reduced responses to substrate stiffness. Together, these findings reveal a hitherto unidentified relationship between energy expenditure and the cellular mechanoresponse, and point to AMPK as a key mediator of stem cell fate in response to ECM mechanics.",

Due to their essential regulatory roles, microRNA biogenesis is tightly regulated, where protein factors are often found to interact with specific primary and precursor microRNAs for regulation. Here, using NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy and mutagenesis, we reveal that the precursor of oncogenic microRNA-21 exists as a pH-dependent ensemble that spontaneously reshuffles the secondary structure of the entire apical stem-loop region, including the Dicer cleavage site. We show that the alternative excited conformation transiently sequesters the bulged adenine into a non-canonical protonated A+-G mismatch, conferring a two-fold enhancement in Dicer processing over its ground conformational state. These results indicate that microRNA maturation efficiency may be encoded in the intrinsic dynamic ensemble of primary and precursor microRNAs, providing potential means of regulating microRNA biogenesis in response to environmental and cellular stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) often acquire genetic changes on prolonged culture, which pose concerns for their use in research and regenerative medicine (Amps et al., 2011, Seth et al., 2011). The acquisition of these changes during culture necessarily first requires mutation and then selection of those mutations that provide a growth advantage. Whilst selection accounts for the recurrent nature of the variants commonly reported (Draper et al., 2004, Olariu et al., 2010), the mechanisms of mutation in PSC remain largely elusive. Here we show that, in contrast to somatic cells, human PSC have an increased susceptibility to DNA damage and mitotic errors, both of which are caused by heightened replication stress in PSC and this can be alleviated by culture with exogenous nucleosides. These results reflect the requirement for rapid replication of human PSC enabled by a truncated G1 (Becker et al., 2006, Becker et al., 2010) that impairs the preparation of these cells for the ensuing DNA replication. A similar relationship has been shown in relation to chromosomal instability in cancer cells (Burrell et al., 2013, Wilhelm et al., 2019) but PSC differ by replication stress triggering apoptosis (Desmarais et al., 2012, Desmarais et al., 2016). Nevertheless, evasion of this response still leads to the appearance of genetic variants that are of concern for regenerative medicine. The inclusion of nucleosides into culture media greatly improves the efficiency of human PSC culture and minimises the acquisition of genomic damage.",

    "abstract": "The {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}TuRC) is the major microtubule nucleator in cells. However, the mechanism of its regulation is not understood. Here, we purified human {gamma}TuRC and quantitatively characterized its nucleation properties in a TIRF microscopy-based real-time nucleation assay. We find that microtubule nucleation by {gamma}TuRC is kinetically inhibited compared to microtubule elongation. Determining the cryo-EM structure of {gamma}TuRC at 4 [A] resolution reveals an asymmetric conformation with only part of the complex in a  closed conformation matching the microtubule geometry. Several factors stabilise the closed conformation. One is actin in the core of the complex and others, likely MZT1 or MZT2, line the outer perimeter of the closed part of {gamma}TuRC. The opposed side of {gamma}TuRC is in an  open, nucleation-incompetent conformation, leading to a structural asymmetry, explaining the kinetic inhibition of nucleation by human {gamma}TuRC. Our data suggest possible regulatory mechanisms for microtubule nucleation by {gamma}TuRC closure.",

    "abstract": "Motives motivate human behavior. Most behaviors are driven by more than one motive, yet it is unclear how different motives interact and how such motive combinations affect the neural computation of the behaviors they drive. To answer this question, we induced two prosocial motives simultaneously (multi-motive condition) and separately (single motive conditions). After the different motive inductions, participants performed the same choice task in which they allocated points in favor of the other person (prosocial choice) or in favor of themselves (egoistic choice). We used fMRI to assess prosocial choice-related brain responses and drift diffusion modelling to specify how motive combinations affect individual components of the choice process. Our results showed that the combination of the two motives in the multi-motive condition increased participants choice biases prior to the behavior itself. On the neural level, these changes in initial prosocial bias were associated with neural responses in the bilateral dorsal striatum. In contrast, the efficiency of the prosocial decision process was comparable between the multi-motive and the single-motive conditions. These findings provide insights into the computation of prosocial choices in complex motivational states, the motivational setting that drives most human behaviors.\n\nHighlightsO_LIActivating different social motives simultaneously can enhance prosocial choices\nC_LIO_LIMulti-motive combinations change initial prosocial biases\nC_LIO_LIDorso-striatal activation increases with larger increase of prosocial bias\nC_LIO_LIMulti-motive combinations modulate relative response caution\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How 3D chromosome organization affects chromosomal aberrations is an important unresolved question in cell and radiation biology. In interphase the chromosomes form territories where chromatin folds into quite heterogeneous states. The mechanisms determining the spectrum of chromosome conformations remain poorly understood. We introduced the polymer model of mouse chromosome and generated the ensemble of 3D conformations. The chromosome model was validated against independent Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture) data. The model described well Hi-C contact heatmap for chromosome 18 in pro-B mouse cells, both ATM-deficient and wild-type. We used the chromosome model to assess the role of chromosome structure in breakpoint distribution for intrachromosomal exchange aberrations. We investigated the effect of elevated frequency of breakpoints outside of the region of enzymatic breaksite. Chromosome aberration model explained breakpoint distribution under recurrent and ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in mouse chromosome 18 on the basis of contact-first mechanism. Overall, our results provide a framework for assessment of role of chromosome 3D organization on chromosome aberrations following DNA damage of different origin.",

    "abstract": "In standard models of molecular evolution, DNA sequences evolve through asynchronous substitutions according to Poisson processes with a constant rate (called the molecular clock) or a time-varying rate (relaxed clock). However, DNA sequences can also undergo episodes of fast divergence that will appear as synchronous substitutions affecting several sites simultaneously at the macroevolutionary time scale. Here, we develop a model combining basal, clock-like molecular evolution with episodes of fast divergence called spikes arising at speciation events. Given a multiple sequence alignment and its time-calibrated species phylogeny, our model is able to detect speciation events (including hidden ones) co-occurring with spike events and to estimate the probability and amplitude of these spikes on the phylogeny. We identify the conditions under which spikes can be distinguished from the natural variance of the clock-like component of molecular evolution and from temporal variations of the clock. We apply the method to genes underlying snake venom proteins and identify several spikes at gene-specific locations in the phylogeny. This work should pave the way for analyses relying on whole genomes to inform on modes of species diversification.",

Hormonal changes have long been associated with adolescence, but it is not clear how these circulating factors create a new motivation and drive its associated behaviors. We show that the transition to sexuality in male Drosophila is controlled by juvenile hormone, which spikes at eclosion and declines over days as the propensity for courtship gradually increases. Juvenile hormone directly inhibits the activity of at least three courtship-motivating circuit elements, ensuring the complete suppression of sexual motivation and behavior. Blocking or overriding these inhibitory mechanisms evokes immediate and robust sexual behavior from very young and otherwise asexual males. These results provide a first example of hormonal changes gating the transition to sexuality by activating latent, but largely developed and functional, motivational circuitry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer-associated muscle wasting (CAW), a symptom of cancer cachexia, is associated with approximately 20% of lung cancer deaths, and remains poorly characterized on a mechanistic level. Current animal models for lung cancer-associated cachexia are limited in that they: 1) primarily employ flank transplantation methods, 2) have short survival times not reflective of the patient condition, and 3) are typically performed in young mice not representative of mean patient age. This study investigates a new model for lung cancer-associated cachexia that can address these issues and also implicates muscle regeneration as a contributor to CAW.\n\nMethodsWe used tail vein injection as a method to introduce tumor cells that seed primarily in the lungs of mice. Body composition of tumor bearing mice was longitudinally tracked using NMR-based, echo magnetic resonance imaging (echoMRI). These data were combined with histological and molecular assessments of skeletal muscle to provide a complete analysis of muscle wasting.\n\nResultsIn this new lung CAW model we observed 1) progressive loss in whole body weight, 2) progressive loss of lean and fat mass, 3) a circulating cytokine/inflammatory profile similar to that seen in other models of CAW, 4) histological changes associated with muscle wasting, and 5) molecular changes in muscle that implicate suppression of muscle repair/regeneration. Finally, we show that survival can be extended without lessening CAW by titrating injected cell number.\n\nConclusionsOverall, this study describes a new model of CAW that could be useful for further studies of lung cancer-associated wasting and accompanying changes in the regenerative capacity of muscle. Additionally, this model addresses many recent concerns with existing models such as immunocompetence, tumor location, and survival time.",

While terrestrial camera-trapping studies have shown that capture frequency, along with the species movement speed and detector specifications can be used to estimate absolute densities, the approach has not yet been adapted to cases where movement occurs in three dimensions. Frameworks based on animal movement patterns allow estimating population density from camera-trapping data when animals are not individually distinguishable.\nC_LIO_LIHere we adapt one such framework to three-dimensional movement to characterize the relationship between population density, animal speed, characteristics of a remote sensors detection zone, and detection frequency. The derivation involves defining the detection zone mathematically and calculating the mean area of the profile it presents to approaching individuals.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed two variants of the model - one assuming random movement of all individuals, and one allowing for different probabilities for each approach direction (e.g. that animals more often swim/fly horizontally than vertically). We used computer simulations to evaluate model performance for a wide range of animal and detector densities. Simulations show that in ideal conditions the method approximates true density well, and that estimates become increasingly accurate using more detectors, or sampling for longer. Moreover, the method is robust to invalidation of assumptions, accuracy is decreased only in extreme cases where all detectors are facing the same way.\nC_LIO_LIWe provide equations for estimating population density from detection frequency and outline how to estimate the necessary parameters. We discuss how environmental variables and species-specific characteristics affect parameter estimates and how to account for these differences in density estimations.\nC_LIO_LIOur method can be applied to common remote detection methods (cameras and acoustic detectors), which are currently being used to study a diversity of species and environments.

Ribosomal profiling revealed translation of the mRNA and the protein was detected in Western blots. A {sigma}70 promoter, transcription start site, Shine-Dalgarno motif and rho-independent terminator were experimentally validated. A pH-dependent phenotype conferred by the protein was shown in competitive overexpression growth experiments of a translationally arrested mutant versus wild type.

    "abstract": "Discovery of influential genetic variants and prediction of phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance are becoming routine tasks in bacterial genomics. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods can be applied to study bacterial populations, with a particular emphasis on alignment-free approaches, which are necessitated by the more plastic nature of bacterial genomes. Here we advance bacterial GWAS by introducing a computationally scalable joint modeling framework, where genetic variants covering the entire pangenome are compactly represented by unitigs, and the model fitting is achieved using elastic net penalization. In contrast to current leading GWAS approaches, which test each genotype-phenotype association separately for each variant, our joint modelling approach is shown to lead to increased statistical power while maintaining control of the false positive rate. Our inference procedure also delivers an estimate of the narrow-sense heritability, which is gaining considerable interest in studies of bacteria. Using an extensive set of state-of-the-art bacterial population genomic datasets we demonstrate that our approach performs accurate phenotype prediction, comparable to popular machine learning methods, while retaining both interpretability and computational efficiency. We expect that these advances will pave the way for the next generation of high-powered association and prediction studies for an increasing number of bacterial species.",

Previously, tDCS modulated the performance of older adults on a complex speech motor learning task, which involved repetition of tongue twisters [1].\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to replicate this finding in healthy young participants and to extend it by measuring tDCS-induced changes in motor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor-evoked potentials elicited in the lips.\n\nMethodIn a double-blind randomized sham-controlled study, three groups of 20 participants received: 1) anodal tDCS to the left IFG/LipM1 and cathodal tDCS to the right hemisphere homologue; or 2) cathodal tDCS over the left and anodal over the right; or 3) sham stimulation. Participants heard and repeated tongue twisters and matched simple sentences before, during and 10 minutes after the stimulation. Motor excitability was measured before and immediately after the tDCS.\n\nResultsThe improvement in performance of tongue twister repetition from baseline to after stimulation was significantly greater than for the simple sentences but did not differ among the three groups. Motor excitability significantly decreased to a small but similar extent across the three groups.\n\nConclusionsTDCS did not modulate performance on a complex articulation task in healthy young adults. TDCS applied concurrently with task learning also failed to modulate motor excitability in expected ways.

    "abstract": "The small first digit (D1) of the mouses hand resembles a volar pad, but its thumb-like anatomy suggests ethological importance for manipulating small objects. To explore this possibility, we recorded high-speed close-up video of mice eating seeds and other food items. Analyses of ethograms and automated tracking with DeepLabCut revealed multiple distinct microstructural features of food-handling. First, we found that mice indeed made extensive use of D1 for dexterous manipulations. In particular, mice used D1 to hold food with either of two grip types: a pincer-type grasp, or a \"thumb-hold\" grip, pressing with D1 from the side. Thumb-holding was preferentially used for handling smaller items, with the smallest items held between the two D1s alone. Second, we observed that mice cycled rapidly between two postural modes while feeding, with the hands positioned either at the mouth (oromanual phase) or resting below (holding phase). Third, we identified two highly stereotyped D1-related movements during feeding, including an extraordinarily fast ([~]20 ms) \"regrip\" maneuver, and a fast ([~]100 ms) \"sniff\" maneuver. Lastly, in addition to these characteristic simpler movements and postures, we also observed highly complex movements, including rapid D1-assisted rotations of food items and dexterous simultaneous double-gripping of two food fragments. Manipulation behaviors were generally conserved for different food types, and for head-fixed mice. Wild squirrels displayed a similar repertoire of D1-related movements. Our results define, for the mouse, a set of kinematic building-blocks of manual dexterity, and reveal an outsized role for D1 in these actions.",

Killifish (oviparous Cyprinodontiformes) evolved an annual life cycle as an exceptional adaptation to life in arid savannah environments characterized by seasonal water availability. The turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) is the shortest-lived vertebrate known to science and displays differences in lifespan among wild populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in the evolution and diversification of life history. Here, by combining genome sequencing and population genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference assembly for the turquoise killifish genome, trace the evolutionary origin of the sex chromosome, and identify genes under strong positive and purifying selection, as well as those evolving neutrally. We find that the shortest-lived turquoise killifish populations, which dwell in fragmented and isolated habitats at the outer margin of the geographical range of the species, are characterized by small effective population size and accumulate throughout the genome several small to large-effect deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. The genes most affected by drift in the shortest-lived turquoise killifish populations are involved in the WNT signalling pathway, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and the mTOR pathway. As the populations under stronger genetic drift are the shortest-lived ones, we propose that limited population size due to habitat fragmentation and repeated population bottlenecks, by causing the genome-wide accumulation of deleterious mutations, cumulatively contribute to the short adult lifespan in turquoise killifish populations.",

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus within the brainstem that consists of norepinephrine-releasing neurons. It is involved in broad processes including autonomic regulation, and cognitive and emotional functions such as arousal, attention and anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms that control the excitability of LC neurons is important because they innervate widespread regions of the central nervous system. One of the key regulators is the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c), the increases in which can be amplified by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from the intracellular calcium stores. Although the electrical activities of LC neurons are regulated by changes in [Ca2+]c, the extent of CICR involvement in this regulation has remained unclear. Here we show that CICR hyperpolarizes acutely dissociated LC neurons of the rat brain and demonstrate the pathway whereby it does this. When CICR was activated by extracellular application of 10 mM caffeine, LC neurons were hyperpolarized in the current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp recording, and the majority of neurons showed an outward current in the voltage-clamp mode. This outward current was accompanied by an increase in membrane conductance, and its reversal potential was close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that it is mediated by the opening of K+ channels. The outward current was generated in the absence of extracellular calcium and was blocked when the calcium stores were inhibited by applying ryanodine. Pharmacological experiments indicated that the outward current was mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels of the non-small conductance type. Finally, the application of caffeine led to an increase in the [Ca2+]c in these neurons, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. These findings delineate a mechanism whereby CICR suppresses the electrical activity of LC neurons, and indicate that it could play a dynamic role in modulating the LC-mediated noradrenergic tone in the brain.",
