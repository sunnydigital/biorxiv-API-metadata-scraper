    "abstract": "Hydroelectricity is often presented as a clean, reliable, and renewable energy source, but is also recognized for its potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem biodiversity. We used empirical data on change in fish species richness following impoundment to develop Characterisation Factors (CF) and Impact Scores (IS) for hydroelectricity production for use in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). We used data collected on 89 sampling stations (63 upstream and 26 downstream of a dam) belonging to 27 reservoirs from three biomes (boreal, temperate and tropical). Overall, the impact of hydroelectricity production on fish species richness was significant in the tropics, of smaller amplitude in temperate and minimal in boreal biome, stressing for the need of regionalisation. The impact of hydroelectricity production was also quite consistent across scales (i.e., same directionality and statistical significance across sampling stations, reservoirs and biomes) but was sensitive to the duration of the study (i.e., the period over which data have been collected after impoundment), highlighting the need for a clear understanding of transient situations before reaching steady states. Our CFs and ISs contribute to fill a gap to assist decision makers using LCA to evaluate alternative technologies, such as hydropower, to decarbonize the worldwide economy.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThis paper is the first to develop global and empirically based characterization factors of the impact of hydroelectricity production on aquatic ecosystems biodiversity, to be used in LCA;\\nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish species richness was significant in the tropics, of smaller amplitude in temperate and minimal in boreal biome;\\nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish richness was consistent across scales - same directionality and statistical significance across sampling stations, reservoirs and biomes;\\nC_LIO_LIThe impact of hydroelectricity production on fish richness was sensitive to the duration of the study, highlighting the need for a clear understanding of transient situations before reaching steady states in LCA.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Under poor nutritional conditions, 3rd instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae will work collaboratively in feeding clusters to obtain resources that cannot be reached individually. To better understand the conditions that influence the expression of this behaviour we examined the frequencies, the size and the membership in vials of flies that were initially seeded with either 100 or 200 eggs each using flies from both a large, outbred population and a replicate population that was homozygous for the bw allele. Overall, more feeding clusters, containing more larval participants were observed in the higher density vials compared to the lower density vials, consistent with the idea that this social behaviour is a response to dwindling resources in the environment. The presence of the bw allele did not result in greater egg-to-adult mortality, nor did it result in lower participation in feeding clusters.",

    "abstract": "We consider a homogeneous birth-death process with incomplete sampling. Three successive sampling schemes are considered. First, individuals can be sampled through time and included in the tree. Second, they can be occurrences which are sampled through time and not included in the tree. Third, individuals reaching present day can be sampled and included in the tree. Upon sampling, individuals are removed (i.e. die).\\n\\nThe outcome of the process is thus composed of the reconstructed evolutionary tree spanning all individuals sampled and included in the tree, and a timeline of occurrence events which are not placed along the tree. We derive a formula allowing one to compute the joint probability density of these, which can readily be used to perform maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the model.\\n\\nIn the context of epidemiology, our probability density allows us to estimate transmission rates through a joint analysis of epidemiological case count data and phylogenetic trees reconstructed from pathogen sequences. Within macroevolution, our equations are the basis for taking into account fossil occurrences from paleontological databases together with extant species phylogenies for estimating speciation and extinction rates. Thus, we provide the theoretical framework for bridging not only the gap between phylogenetics and epidemiology, but also the gap between phylogenetics and paleontology.",

    "abstract": "Cys-loop receptors are vital for controlling neuronal excitability in the brain and their dysfunction results in numerous neurological disorders. Recently, six de novo missense variants in GABRA2 gene, a member of this family, have been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) and intellectual disability with seizures. Here, using whole-genome sequencing we identified a de novo missense variant in GABRA2 gene in a patient with EIEE and developmental delay. We perform protein structural analysis of the seven variants and show that all the mutations are in the transmembrane domain, either close to the desensitization gate, the activation gate or in inter-subunit interfaces. Further investigations demonstrated that the majority of pathogenic variants reported are at equivalent positions in other Cys-loop receptors, emphasizing the importance of these residues for the adequate function of the receptor. Also, a comparison of the distribution of the mutations in all the Cys-loop receptors showed that pathogenic variants are more common in the transmembrane helices, more specifically in the M2 helix, highlighting the importance of this segment. Our study expands the clinical spectrum of individuals with pathogenic missense mutations in GABRA2, defines the regions where pathogenic mutations are in the protein structure, and highlights the value of considering sequence, evolutionary, and structural information from other Cys-loop receptors as a strategy for variant interpretation of novel missense mutations in GABRA2.",

We identified in vivo community-level and in vitro phenotypic cooperation by specific nasal Corynebacterium species. Also, D. pigrum inhibited S. aureus growth in vitro. Whereas, robust inhibition of S. pneumoniae required both D. pigrum and a nasal Corynebacterium together, and not either alone. D. pigrum L-lactic-acid production was insufficient to account for these inhibitions. Genomic analysis of 11 strains revealed that D. pigrum has a small genome (average 1.86 Mb) and multiple predicted auxotrophies consistent with D. pigrum relying on its human host and cocolonizing bacteria for key nutrients. Further, the accessory genome of D. pigrum encoded a diverse repertoire of biosynthetic gene clusters, some of which may have a role in microbe-microbe interactions.\n\nConclusionsThese new insights into D. pigrums functions advance the field from compositional analysis to genomic and phenotypic experimentation on a potentially beneficial bacterial resident of the human upper respiratory tract and lay the foundation for future animal and clinical experiments.",

    "abstract": "While geographically-/geologically-distinct hot springs harbor different levels of microbial diversity, some of them encompass several such taxa which have no strain reported for laboratory growth at >45{degrees}C. We, therefore, hypothesized that native geomicrobial factors could be potent determinants of the microbial habitability of hot spring environments. To test this hypothesis, aquatic microbial communities were revealed metataxonomically, and considered in the context of spring-water chemistry, along the 85-14{degrees}C hydrothermal gradient of a sulfur-boron spring named Lotus Pond located at 4,436 m, within the Puga geothermal area of the Indian Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh. Water samples were studied from four distinct sites along Lotus Ponds spring-water transit from the vent to an adjacent river called Rulang. Insinuations obtained from geomicrobiological data were tested via pure-culture growth experiments in habitat-inspired media. Microbial diversities were found to be high at all the sample-sites; majority of the genera identified at the 70-85{degrees}C sites were found to have no report of laboratory growth at >45{degrees}C; concurrently, these sample-sites had high concentrations of the kosmotropic solutes boron, lithium, sodium, sulfide, thiosulfate and sulfate, which are known to biophysically stabilize macromolecules. Based on the universal thermodynamic status of these solutes, we conjectured that they may be instrumental in helping mesophiles withstand high in situ temperatures. Corroboratively, growth experiments with a mesophilic, 80{degrees}C-isolate, Paracoccus SMMA_5 showed that at 50{degrees}C and 70{degrees}C, depending on the incubation-time, lithium/boron/sulfate/sodium/glycine-betaine either increases the number of colony-forming units present in the culture or arrests decline of the same. Incubations at 70{degrees}C, followed by fluorescein diacetate staining and flow cytometry, showed that these solutes keep more cells under viable condition than in ready-to-divide state. We concluded that kosmotropes and compatible solutes help mesophiles overcome the chaotropic effects of heat by augmenting such indigenous, entropy-minimizing biophysical mechanisms that apparently trade-off cell division for cell viability.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemases inactivate most {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and have been frequently reported among Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Traditionally, the horizontal gene transfer of carbapenemase encoding genes (CEGs) has been linked to plasmids. However, given that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are possibly the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes, we conducted an in-silico analysis to ascertain the likely role of ICEs in the spread of CEGs among all bacterial genomes (n=182,663). We detected 17,520 CEGs, of which 66 were located within putative ICEs among several bacterial species (including clinically-relevant bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). Most CEGs detected within ICEs belong to the IMP, NDM and SPM metallo-beta-lactamase families, and the serine beta-lactamase KPC and GES families. Different mechanisms were likely responsible for acquisition of these genes. The majority of CEG-bearing ICEs belong to the MPFG, MPFT and MPFF classes and often encode resistance to other antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones). This study provides a snapshot of the different CEGs associated with ICEs among available bacterial genomes and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of ICEs to the spread of carbapenem resistance globally.\n\nAuthor NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.\n\nImpact StatementCarbapenems are commonly used to treat severe infections in humans. Resistance is often mediated by carbapenemases. These enzymes degrade carbapenems and are frequently present in plasmids. Here, we demonstrate that common carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) found in clinical isolates (e.g. blaKPC, blaGES, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaVIM) can also be located within integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). CEG-bearing ICEs belong to three mating-pair formation families. These mobile elements may be particularly important in bacteria where plasmids do not seem to play a significant role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, as Pseudomonas spp. This study considerably expands the knowledge of the repertoire of CEGs-bearing ICEs among clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.\n\nData SummaryAll the bacterial genomes scanned in this study have been deposited previously in the National Center for Biotechnology Information genome database and are listed on the supplementary tables.

    "abstract": "Penfields description of the \\\"homunculus\\\", a \\\"grotesque creature\\\" with large lips and hands and small trunk and legs depicting the representation of body-parts within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), is one of the most prominent contributions to the neurosciences. Since then, numerous studies have identified additional body-parts representations outside of S1. Nevertheless, it has been implicitly assumed that S1s homunculus is representative of the entire somatosensory cortex. Therefore, the distribution of body-parts representations in other brain regions, the property that gave Penfields homunculus its famous \\\"grotesque\\\" appearance, has been overlooked. We used whole-body somatosensory stimulation, functional MRI and a new cortical parcellation to quantify the organization of the cortical somatosensory representation. Our analysis showed first, an extensive somatosensory response over the cortex; and second, that the proportional representation of body-parts differs substantially between major neuroanatomical regions and from S1, with, for instance, much larger trunk representation at higher brain regions, potentially in relation to the regions functional specialization. These results extend Penfields initial findings to the higher level of somatosensory processing and suggest a major role for somatosensation in human cognition.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for neuroscience is to develop generative, causal models of the human nervous system in an individualized, data-driven manner. Previous initiatives have either constructed biologically-plausible models that are not constrained by individual-level human brain activity or used data-driven statistical characterizations of individuals that are not mechanistic. We aim to bridge this gap through the development of a new modeling approach termed Mesoscale Individualized Neurodynamic (MINDy) modeling, wherein we fit nonlinear dynamical systems models directly to human brain imaging data. The MINDy framework is able to produce these data-driven network models for hundreds to thousands of interacting brain regions in just 1-3 minutes per subject. We demonstrate that the models are valid, reliable, and robust. We show that MINDy models are predictive of individualized patterns of resting-state brain dynamical activity. Furthermore, MINDy is better able to uncover the mechanisms underlying individual differences in resting state activity than functional connectivity methods.",

However, knowledge of the signaling mechanism(s) that mediates the effect of melanocortin remains incomplete.\\n\\nMethodsROCK1 is a key regulator of energy balance in the hypothalamus. To explore the role of ROCK1 in the anorexigenic action of melanocortin, we deleted ROCK1 in MC4R neurons in mice. Next, we studied the metabolic effects of MC4R neuron-specific ROCK1-deficiency and following treatment with -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH).\\n\\nResultsHere we show that -MSH increases Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) activity in the hypothalamus. Deficiency of ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing neurons results in increased body weight in mice fed normal chow diet. This is likely due to increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure. Importantly, we find that ROCK1 activation in MC4R expressing neurons is required for melanocortin action, as evidenced by the fact that - MSHs ability to suppress food intake is impaired in MC4R neuron-specific ROCK1-deficient mice. To elucidate the mechanism by which ROCK1 mediates melanocortin action, we performed in vitro studies in hypothalamic cells expressing MC4R. We demonstrate that -MSH promotes the physical interaction of ROCK1 and G12, and this results in suppression of AMPK activity.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study identifies ROCK1 as a novel mediator of melanocortins anorexigenic action and uncover a new MC4R[-&gt;]G12[-&gt;]ROCK1[-&gt;]AMPK signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "Metformin, the worlds most prescribed anti-diabetic drug, is also effective in preventing Type 2 diabetes in people at high risk, by lowering body weight, fat mass and circulating insulin levels through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Recent observational studies reporting the association of metformin use and circulating levels of GDF15 led us to hypothesize that GDF15, which signals through a specific receptor complex in the hindbrain to reduce body weight, might mediate these effects. We measured GDF15 in people without diabetes from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of metformin. Over 18 months, participants allocated metformin lost significant weight and levels of GDF15 were persistently elevated compared to placebo. The change in plasma GDF15 in this study correlated positively with weight loss. In wild-type mice, oral metformin increased circulating GDF15 with GDF15 expression increasing predominantly in the distal intestine and the kidney. Metformin prevented weight gain in response to high fat diet in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking GDF15 or its receptor GFRAL. In obese, high fat-fed mice, the effects of metformin to reduce body weight were reversed by a GFRAL antagonist antibody. Metformin had effects on both energy intake and energy expenditure that required GDF15. The insulin sensitising effects of metformin determined by insulin tolerance were abolished in mice lacking GDF15. Metformin significantly reduced fasting glucose and insulin levels in wild type but not in mice lacking GDF15. In summary, metformin increases the circulating levels of GDF15, which appears to be necessary for many of its actions as a metabolic chemopreventive agent.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that increased arginase activity affects vital bioprocesses in various systems and universally mediates the pathogenesis of numerous metabolic diseases. The adverse effects of arginase are associated with a severe decline in L-arginine bioavailability, which leads to nitric oxide synthase substrate insufficiency, uncoupling, and, eventually, to superoxide anion generation and substantial reduction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. In cooperation, it contributes to chronic oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which might lead to hypertension and atherosclerosis.\\n\\nRecent preclinical investigations point to arginase as a promising therapeutic target in ameliorating metabolic and vascular dysfunctions. In the present study, adult rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH) were used as a model of hypertension. Wistar rats served as normotensive controls. Experimental animals were intraperitoneally administered for seven days with non-proteinogenic amino acid L-norvaline (30 mg/kg/day), which is a potent arginase inhibitor, or with the vehicle. Blood pressure (BP), body weight, and diuresis were monitored. The changes in blood and urine levels of creatinine, urea, and NO metabolites were analyzed.\\n\\nWe observed a significant decline in BP and induced diuresis in ISIAH rats following the treatment. The same procedure did not affect the BP of control animals. Remarkably, the treatment had no influence upon glomerular filtration rate in two experimental groups, just like the daily excretion of creatinine and urea. Conversely, NO metabolites levels were amplified in normotonic but not in hypertensive rats following the treatment.\\n\\nThe data indicate that L-norvaline is a potential antihypertensive agent, and deserves to be clinically investigated. Moreover, we suggest that changes in blood and urine are causally related to the effect of L-norvaline upon the BP regulation.",

    "abstract": "Living cells can express different metabolic pathways that support growth. The criteria that determine which pathways are selected in which environment remain unclear. One recurrent selection is overflow metabolism: the simultaneous usage of an ATP-efficient and -inefficient pathway, shown for example in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cancer cells. Many models, based on different assumptions, can reproduce this observation. Therefore, they provide no conclusive evidence which mechanism is causing overflow metabolism. We compare the mathematical structure of these models. Although ranging from Flux Balance Analyses to self-fabricating Metabolism and Expression models, we can rewrite all models into one standard form. We conclude that all models predict overflow metabolism when two, model-specific, growth-limiting constraints are hit. This is consistent with recent theory. Thus, identifying these two constraints is essential for understanding overflow metabolism. We list all imposed constraints by these models, so that they can hopefully be tested in future experiments.",

    "abstract": "Despite the critical regulatory roles that receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTP) play in mammalian signal transduction, the detailed structural basis for the regulation of their catalytic activity is not fully understood, nor are they generally therapeutically targetable. It is due, in part, to the lack of known natural ligands or selective agonists. In contrast to conventional structure-function relationship for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the activity of RPTPs has been reported to be suppressed by dimerization, which may prevent their access to their RTK substrates. We report here that: (i) homodimerization of PTPRJ (also known as DEP-1) is regulated by specific transmembrane (TM) residues, and (ii) disrupting these interactions can destabilize full-length PTPRJ homodimerization in cells, reduce the phosphorylation of EGFR (a known substrate) and downstream signaling effectors, antagonize EGFR-driven cell phenotypes, and promote substrate access. We demonstrate these points in human cancer cells using both mutational studies and through the identification of a peptide designed to bind to the PTPRJ TM domain. This peptide is the first example of such allosteric agonist of RPTPs. This study, therefore, provides not only fundamental structure-function insights on how PTPRJ activity is tuned by TM interactions in cells but also opportunities to develop a unique class of agents that could be used as tools to probe RPTPs signaling regulating mechanisms or for therapeutic purposes in cancers driven by RTK signaling.",

    "abstract": "The effect of environmental fluctuations is a major question in ecology. While it is widely accepted that fluctuations and other types of disturbances can increase biodiversity, we have only a limited understanding of the circumstances in which other types of outcomes can occur in a fluctuating environment. Here we explore this question with laboratory microcosms, using cocultures of two bacterial species, P. putida and P. veronii. At low dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. veronii, whereas at high dilution rates we observe competitive exclusion of P. putida. When the dilution rate alternates between high and low, we do not observe coexistence between the species, but rather alternative stable states, in which only one species survives and initial species fractions determine the identity of the surviving species. The Lotka-Volterra model with a fluctuating mortality rate predicts that this outcome is independent of the timing of the fluctuations, and that the time-averaged mortality would also lead to alternative stable states, a prediction that we confirm experimentally. Other pairs of species can coexist in a fluctuating environment, and again consistent with the model we observe coexistence in the time-averaged dilution rate. We find a similar time-averaging result holds in a three-species community, highlighting that simple linear models can in some cases provide powerful insight into how communities will respond to environmental fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Ecological and evolutionary processes can occur at similar time scales, and hence influence one another. There has been much progress in the development of metrics that quantify contributions of ecological and evolutionary components to trait change over time. However, many empirical evolutionary ecology studies document genetic differentiation among populations structured in space. In both time and space, the observed differentiation in trait values among populations and communities can be the result of interactions between non-evolutionary (phenotypic plasticity, changes in the relative abundance of species) and evolutionary (genetic differentiation among populations) processes. However, the tools developed so far to quantify ecological and evolutionary contributions to trait change are implicitly addressing temporal dynamics because they require directionality of change from an ancestral to a derived state. Identifying directionality from one site to another in spatial studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics is not always possible and often not desired. We here suggest three modifications to existing metrics so they allow the partitioning of ecological and evolutionary contributions to changes in population and community trait values across landscapes. Applying these spatially modified metrics to published empirical examples shows how these metrics can be used to generate new empirical insights and to facilitate future comparative analyses. The possibility to apply eco-evolutionary partitioning metrics to populations and communities in real landscapes is critical as it will broaden our capacity to quantify eco-evolutionary interactions as they occur in nature.",

    "abstract": "The defining feature of the eukaryotic cell is the possession of a nucleus that uncouples transcription from translation. This uncoupling of transcription from translation depends on a complex process employing hundreds of eukaryotic specific genes acting in concert and requires the 7-methylguanylate (m7G) cap to prime eukaryotic mRNA for splicing, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic translation. The origin of this complex system is currently a paradox since it is not found or needed in prokaryotic cells which lack nuclei, yet it was apparently present and fully functional in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). According to the Viral Eukaryogenesis (VE) hypothesis the abrupt appearance of the nucleus in the eukaryotic lineage occurred because the nucleus descends from the viral factory of a DNA phage that infected the archaeal ancestor of the eukaryotes. Consequently, the system for uncoupling of transcription from translation in eukaryotes is predicted by the VE hypothesis to be viral in origin. In support of this hypothesis it is shown here that m7G capping apparatus that primes the uncoupling of transcription from translation in eukaryotes is present in viruses of the Mimiviridae but absent from bona-fide archaeal relatives of the eukaryotes such as Lokiarchaeota. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the m7G capping pathway indicates that eukaryotic nuclei and Mimiviridae obtained this pathway from a common ancestral source that predated the origin of LECA. These results support the VE hypothesis and suggest the eukaryotic nucleus and the Mimiviridae descend from a common First Eukaryotic Nuclear Ancestor (FENA).",

Here we investigated each individual SMN complex member and identified gemin3 as another regeneration-essential gene. These three genes are likely pan-regenerative since they affect the regeneration of hair cells, liver and caudal fin. RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq analyses reveal that smn1, gemin3, and gemin5 are linked to a common set of genetic pathways, including the tp53 and ErbB pathways. Additional studies indicated all three genes facilitate regeneration by inhibiting the ErbB pathway, thereby allowing cell proliferation in the injured neuromasts. This study provides a new understanding of the SMN complex and a potential etiology for SMA and potentially other rare unidentified genetic diseases with similar symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Most of our crops are grown in monoculture with single genotypes grown over wide acreage. An alternative approach, where segregating populations are used as crops is an exciting possibility, but outcomes of natural selection upon this type of crop are not well understood. We tracked allelic frequency changes in evolving composite cross populations (CCPs) of wheat grown over ten generations under organic and conventional farming. At three generations, each population was genotyped with 19 SSR and 8 SNP markers. The latter were diagnostic for major functional genes. Gene diversity was constant at SSR markers but decreased over time for genic markers. Population differentiation between the four locations could not be detected, suggesting that organic vs. non-organic crop management did not drive allele frequency changes. However, we did see changes for genes controlling plant height and phenology in all populations independently and consistently. We interpret these changes as the result of a consistent natural selection towards wild-type. Independent selection for alleles that are associated with plant height suggests that competition for light was central, resulting in the predominance of stronger intraspecific competitors, and highlighting a potential trade-off between individual and population performance.",

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to Alzheimers disease and previous work established that ABL is a downstream effector in an Appl, the Drosophila App ortholog, signaling pathway which modulates axon outgrowth in the mushroom bodies (MBs), the fly memory center. Here we show that Abl is required for the MB neuron axonal growth. Importantly, both Abl overexpression and lack of expression produce a similar phenotype in the MBs indicating the necessity of tightly regulating ABL activity. We find that the fly huntingtin protein (HTT), the homolog of the protein involved in Huntingtons disease, behaves genetically as a repressor of ABL activity. Supporting this, FRET-based measurements of in vivo ABL activity in the MBs reveal a clear increase in its activity when HTT levels are reduced. Thus, in addition to its many other reported roles, HTT acts as a negative regulator of ABL activity, at least in the MBs, to maintain its appropriate physiological levels necessary for axon growth.",

The current study utilized naturalistic viewing to examine cortical development of long timescale processing and its relation to social-cognitive abilities in middle childhood - a time of expanding social spheres and increasing social-cognitive abilities. We found that, compared to adults, children exhibited reduced low-frequency power in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and reduced specialization for long timescale processing within the TPJ and other regions broadly implicated in the default mode network and higher-order visual processing. Further, specialization for long timescales within the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex became more  adult-like as a function of childrens comprehension of character mental states.

General linear models identified the effects of paternal- and maternal-child relationships in different sets of functional connectivity, which we termed functional brain connectomes associated with paternal- and maternal-child relationship (FBCp and FBCm), respectively. Subsequent connectome-based models using these FBCs significantly predicted aggressive behaviors only for boys and internalizing problems selectively only girls. Lastly, a causal discovery method identified causal paths from daughter-mother relationship to FBCm, and then to daughters internalizing problems. These observations highlight sex-dependent mechanisms linking child-parent relationship, brain, and psychobehavioral problems in early adolescence.",

To assess the associations between changes in adiposity, metabolism and inflammation and changes in GM or WM density, the mean GM and WM densities were extracted across all the participants using atlas, and linear mixed-effect models were used.\\n\\nResultsAs expected, weight, BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference significantly decreased after SG compared with baseline (p<0.001 for all). A widespread increase in WM density was observed after surgery, particularly in the cerebellum, brain stem, cerebellar peduncle, cingulum, corpus callosum and corona radiata (p<0.05, after FDR correction). Significant increases in GM density were observed 4 months after SG compared to baseline in several brain regions such as the bilateral occipital cortex, temporal cortex, precentral gyrus and cerebellum as well as right fusiform gyrus, right hippocampus and right insula. These GM and WM increases were more pronounced and widespread after 12 months and were significantly associated with post-operative weight loss and the improvement of metabolic alterations. Our linear mixed-effect models also showed strong associations between post-operative reductions in LBP, a marker of inflammation, and increased WM density. To confirm our results, we tested whether the peak of each significant region showed BMI-related differences in an independent dataset (Human Connectome Project). We matched a group of severely obese individuals with a group of lean individuals for age, gender and ethnicity. Severe obesity was associated with reduced WM density in the brain stem and cerebellar peduncle as well as reduced GM density in cerebellum, regions that significantly changed after surgery (p<0.01 for all clusters).\\n\\nConclusionsBariatric surgery-induced weight loss and improvement in metabolic alterations is associated with widespread increases in WM and GM densities. These post-operative changes overlapped with baseline brain differences between severely obese and normal-weight individuals, which may suggest a recovery of WM and GM alterations after bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical experiments have demonstrated large and highly systematic perceptual distortions of tactile space. We investigated the neural basis of tactile space by analyzing activity patterns induced by tactile stimulation of nine points on a 3 x 3 square grid on the hand dorsum using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). We used a searchlight approach within pre-defined regions of interests (ROIs) to compute the pairwise Euclidean distances between the activity patterns elicited by tactile stimulation. Then, we used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to reconstruct tactile space at the neural level and compare it with skin space at the perceptual level. Our reconstructions of the shape of skin space in contralateral primary somatosensory (SI) and motor (M1) cortices reveal that it is distorted in a way that matches the perceptual shape of skin space. This suggests that early sensorimotor areas are critical to processing tactile space perception.\\n\\nSignificant StatementHere, we show that the primary somatosensory (SI) and motor (M1) cortices, rather than higher-level brain areas, are critical to estimating distances between tactile stimuli on the hand dorsum. By combining functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), Procrustes alignment, and multidimensional scaling, we reconstructed the shape of skin space in the brain. Strikingly, the shape of the skin that we reconstructed from neural data matches the distortions we found at the behavioral level, providing strong evidence that early sensorimotor areas are critical for the construction of tactile space. Our work therefore supports the view that tactile distance perception is computed at lower level in the somatosensory system than is usually supposed.",

    "abstract": "The molecular and genetic basis of tumor recurrence is complex and poorly understood. RIPK3 is a key effector in programmed necrotic cell death and, therefore, its expression is frequently suppressed in primary tumors. In a transcriptome profiling between primary and recurrent breast tumor cells from a murine model of breast cancer recurrence, we found that RIPK3, while absent in primary tumor cells, is dramatically re-expressed in recurrent breast tumor cells by an epigenetic mechanism. Unexpectedly, we found that RIPK3 knockdown in recurrent tumor cells reduced clonogenic growth, causing cytokinesis failure, p53 stabilization, and repressed the activities of YAP/TAZ. These data uncover a surprising role of the pro-necroptotic RIPK3 kinase in enabling productive cell cycle during tumor recurrence. Remarkably, high RIPK3 expression also rendered recurrent tumor cells exquisitely dependent on extracellular cystine and undergo programmed necrosis upon cystine deprivation. The induction of RIPK3 in recurrent tumors unravels an unexpected mechanism that paradoxically confers on tumors both growth advantage and necrotic vulnerability, providing potential strategies to eradicate recurrent tumors.",

This within-population niche variation can stabilize population dynamics, reduce extinction risk, and alter community composition. But, we still only vaguely understand the ecological contexts that promote niche variation and its stabilizing effects. Adaptive dynamics models predict that intraspecific variation should be greater in environments with two or more equally-profitable resources, but reduced in environments dominated by one resource. Here, we confirm this prediction using a comparison of threespine stickleback in 33 lakes in on Vancouver Island, Canada. Stickleback consume a combination of benthic and limnetic invertebrates, focusing on the former in small lakes, the latter in large lakes. Intermediate-sized lakes support generalist populations, which arise via greater among-individual diet variation, not by greater individual diet breadth. These intermediate lakes exhibit correspondingly greater morphological diversity, while genomic diversity increases linearly with lake size. These results support the theoretical expectation that habitats with an intermediate ratio of resources are \\\"just right\\\" for promoting ecologically relevant intraspecific diversification.",

    "abstract": "The timing and duration of sleep results from the interaction between a sleep-wake driven, or homeostatic, process (S) and a circadian process (C), and involves changes in gene expression and genomic regulation. Unraveling the respective contributions of S and C, and their interaction, to transcriptional and epigenomic regulatory dynamics requires sampling over time under unperturbed conditions and conditions of perturbed sleep. Here, we profiled mRNA expression and chromatin accessibility in the cerebral cortex of mice over a three-day period, including a 6-hour sleep deprivation (SD) on day two. Mathematical modeling established that a large proportion of rhythmic genes are actually governed by Process S with varying degrees of interaction with Process C, sometimes working in opposition. Remarkably, SD causes long-term effects on gene expression dynamics, outlasting phenotypic recovery, most strikingly illustrated by a dampening of the oscillation of most core clock genes, including Bmal1, suggesting that enforced wakefulness directly impacts the molecular clock machinery. Chromatin accessibility proved highly plastic and dynamically affected by SD. Distal regions, rather than promoters, display dynamics corresponding to gene transcription, implying that changes in mRNA expression result from constantly accessible promoters under the influence of distal enhancers or repressors. Srf was predicted as a transcriptional regulator driving immediate response, suggesting that Srf activity mirrors the build-up and release of sleep pressure. Our results demonstrate that a single, short SD has long-term aftereffects at the genomic regulatory level. Such effects might accumulate with repeated sleep restrictions, thereby contributing to their adverse health effects.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhen and how long we sleep is determined by the time-of-day and how long we have been awake, which are tracked molecularly by a circadian and a sleep-wake driven process, respectively. We measured the long-term consequences of a short-term sleep deprivation (SD) on gene expression and regulation in the mouse brain, and used mathematical models to determine the relative contributions of the circadian and sleep-wake driven processes. We find that many genes, including most of the genes that constitute the molecular circadian clock, are perturbed by SD long after the mice ceased showing behavioral signs of sleep loss. Our results have implications for human health, given the high prevalence of insufficient and poor quality sleep in our contemporary society.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase Mkp-1 is an essential negative regulator of innate immune responses. In enterocytes, Mkp-1, which is transiently expressed in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, plays a role as an initial step in establishing tolerance to bacteria and their pro-inflammatory molecules. Mkp-1 has a very short half-life (about 30 min) in IEC-6 enterocytes. Here we examined the mechanism of Mkp-1 rapid degradation in IEC-6 cells. Immunoprecipitation and proteolysis inhibitor analysis indicated that Mkp-1 is monoubiquitinated and degraded by proteasome. Dominant negative ubiquitin increased Mkp-1 half-life, indicating involvement of ubiquitination in Mkp-1 degradation. Stability of Mkp-1 is not affected by LPS treatment, consistent with constitutive degradation. U0126, a potent and selective inhibitor of extracellular response kinase (ERK) had negligible effect on the stability of both intrinsic and ectopically expressed Mkp-1, therefore enterocytes, unlike other cell types, do not regulate Mkp-1 degradation via ERK-dependent phosphorylation. C-Truncations of the C-terminal non-catalytic domain (at amino acids 306, 331, and 357), the 306-330 deletion obliterating the potential PEST domains, as well as S296A mutation, but not S323A, S358A, or S363A mutations in potential ERK phosphorylation sites dramatically stabilized Mkp-1. C-terminal fusion of the non-catalytic C-terminal domain of Mkp-1 conferred accelerated degradation on the intrinsically stable green fluorescent protein. According to these results, rapid degradation of Mkp-1 in IEC-6 enterocytes is ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent and ERK-independent. Multiple elements of the C-terminal non-catalytic domain play essential roles in the formation of the complex rapid degradation signal.",

Real-time monitoring of stomatal dynamics can be used for predicting the plant hydraulics, photosensitivity, and gas exchanges effectively. To date, several techniques offer the direct or indirect measurement of stomatal dynamics, yet none offer real-time, long-term persistent measurement of multiple stomal apertures simultaneously of an intact leaf in a field under natural conditions. Here, we report a high-resolution portable microscope-based technique for in situ real-time field imaging and monitoring of stomata. Our technique is capable of analyzing and quantifying the multiple lower epidermis stomal pore dynamics simultaneously and does not require any physical or chemical manipulation of a leaf. An upward facing objective lens in our portable microscope allows the imaging of lower epidermis stomatal opening of a leaf while upper epidermis being exposed to the natural environment. Small depth of field (~ 1.3 m) of a high-magnifying objection lens assists in focusing the stomatal plane in highly non-planar tomato leaf having a high density of trichome (hair-like structures). For long-term monitoring, the leaf is fixed mechanically by a novel designed leaf holder providing freedom to expose the upper epidermis to the sunlight and lower epidermis to the wind simultaneously. In our study, a direct relation between the stomatal opening and the intensity of sunlight illuminating on the upper epidermis has been observed in real-time. In addition, real-time porosity of leaf (ratio between the areas of stomatal opening to the area of a leaf) and stomatal aspect ratio (ratio between the major axis and minor axis of stomatal opening) along with stomatal density have been quantified.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic kinetic models of biological pathways are an important tool for understanding biological systems. Constructing kinetic models requires fitting the parameters to experimental data. However, parameter fitting on these models is a non-convex, non-linear optimization problem. Many algorithms have been proposed to addressing optimization for parameter fitting including globally convergent, population-based algorithms. The computational complexity of the this optimization for even modest models means that parallelization is essential. Past approaches to parameter optimization have focused on parallelizing a particular algorithm. However, this requires re-implementing the algorithm usinga distributed computing framework, which requires a significant investment of time and effort. There are two major drawbacks of this approach: First, the choice of best algorithm may depend on the model. Given the large variety of optimization algorithms available, it is difficult to re-implement every potentially useful algorithm. Second, when new advances are made in a given optimization algorithm, the parallel implementation must be updated to take advantage of these advantages. Thus, there is a continual burden placed on the parallel implementation. The drawbacks of re-implementing algorithms lead us to a different approach to parallelizing parameter optimization. Instead of parallelizing the algorithms themselves, we run many instances of the algorithm on single cores. This provides great flexibility as to the choice of algorithms by allowing us to reuse previous implementations. Also, it does not require the creation and maintenance of parallel versions of optimization algorithms. This approach is known as the island method. To our knowledge, the utility of the island method for parameter fitting in systems biology has not been previously demonstrated. For the parameter fitting problem, we allow islands to exchange information about their \\\"best\\\" solutions so that all islands leverage the discoveries of the few. This turns out to be avery effective in practice, leading to super-linear speedups. That is, if a single processor finds the optimal value of parameters in time t, then N processors exchanging information in this way find the optimal value much faster than t/N. We show that the island method is able to consistently provide good speedups for these problems. We also benchmark the island method against a variety of large, challenging kinetic models and show that it is able to consistently improve the quality of fit in less time than a single-threaded implementation.Our software is available at https://github.com/sys-bio/sabaody under a Apache 2.0 license.\\n\\nContactmailto:medjk@comcast.net",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPDiscontinuous transcription has been described for different mammalian cell lines and numerous promoters. However, our knowledge of how the activity of individual promoters is adjusted by dynamic signaling inputs from transcription factor is limited. To address this question, we characterized the activity of selected target genes that are regulated by pulsatile accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53 in response to ionizing radiation. We performed time resolved measurements of gene expression at the single cell level by smFISH and used the resulting data to inform a mathematical model of promoter activity. We found that p53 target promoters are regulated by frequency modulation of stochastic bursting and can be grouped along three archetypes of gene expression. The occurrence of these archetypes cannot solely be explained by nuclear p53 abundance or promoter binding of total p53. Instead, we provide evidence that the time-varying acetylation state of p53s C-terminal lysine residues is critical for gene-specific regulation of stochastic bursting.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the last decade, integrative studies of microbiome and metabolome have experienced exponential growth in understanding their impact on human health and diseases. However, analyzing the resulting multi-omics data and their correlations remains a significant challenge in current studies due to the lack of a comprehensive computational tool to facilitate data integration and interpretation. In this study, we have developed a microbiome and metabolome integrative analysis pipeline (M2IA) to meet the urgent needs for tools that effectively integrate microbiome and metabolome data to derive biological insights.\\n\\nResultsM2IA streamlines the integrative data analysis between metabolome and microbiome, including both univariate analysis and multivariate modeling methods. KEGG-based functional analysis of microbiome and metabolome are provided to explore their biological interactions within specific metabolic pathways. The functionality of M2IA was demonstrated using TwinsUK cohort data with 1116 fecal metabolites and 16s rRNA microbiome from 786 individuals. As a result, we identified two important pathways, i.e., the benzoate degradation and phosphotransferase system, were closely associated with obesity from both metabolome and microbiome.\\n\\nConclusionsM2IA is a public available web server (http://m2ia.met-bioinformatics.cn) with the capability to investigate the complex interplay between microbiome and metabolome, and help users to develop mechanistic hypothesis for nutritional and personalized therapies of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs are promiscuous and bind to multiple targets. On the one hand, these targets may be linked to unwanted side effects, but on the other, they may achieve a combined desired effect (polypharmacology) or represent multiple diseases (drug repositioning). With the growth of 3D structures of drug-target complexes, it is today possible to study drug promiscuity at the structural level and to screen vast amounts of drug-target interactions to predict side effects, polypharmacological potential, and repositioning opportunities. Here, we pursue such an approach to identify drugs inactivating B-cells, whose dysregulation can function as a driver of autoimmune diseases. Screening over 500 kinases, we identified 22, whose knock out impeded the activation of B-cells. Among these 22 is the gene KDR, whose gene product VEGFR2 is a prominent cancer target with anti-VEGFR2 drugs on the market for over a decade. The main result of this paper is that structure-based drug repositioning for the identified kinase targets identified the cancer drug ibrutinib as micromolar VEGFR2 inhibitor with a very high therapeutic index in B-cell inactivation. These findings prove that ibrutinib is not only acting on the Brutons tyrosine kinase BTK, against which it was designed. Instead, it may be a polypharmacological drug, which additionally targets angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR2. Therefore ibrutinib carries potential to treat other VEGFR2 associated disease. Structure-based drug repositioning explains ibrutinibs anti VEGFR2 action through a specific pattern of interactions shared between BTK and VEGFR2. Overall, structure-based drug repositioning was able to predict these findings at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screen.",

Although evidence from multiple flowering plants suggests that zygotes become transcriptionally active soon after fertilization, the timing and developmental requirements of zygotic genome activation in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) remained a matter of debate until recently. In this report, we optimized an expansion microscopy technique for robust immunostaining of Arabidopsis ovules and seeds. This enabled the detection of marks indicative of active transcription in zygotes before the first cell division. Moreover, we employed a live-imaging culture system together with transcriptional inhibitors to demonstrate that such active transcription is required in zygotes.

    "abstract": "Human-driven habitat fragmentation and loss have led to a proliferation of small and isolated plant and animal populations with high risk of extinction. One of the main threats to extinction in these populations is inbreeding depression, which is primarily caused by the exposure of recessive deleterious mutations as homozygous by inbreeding. The typical approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, often by translocating individuals from large populations to initiate a  genetic rescue. However, the limitations of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which was driven to the brink of extinction soon after the arrival of a migrant from the large mainland wolf population. Here, we use a novel population genetic simulation framework to investigate the role of genetic diversity, deleterious variation, and demographic history in mediating extinction risk due to inbreeding depression in small populations. We show that, under realistic models of dominance, large populations harbor high levels of recessive strongly deleterious variation due to these mutations being hidden from selection in the heterozygous state. As a result, when large populations contract, they experience a substantially elevated risk of extinction after these strongly deleterious mutations are exposed by inbreeding. Moreover, we demonstrate that although translocating individuals to small populations is broadly effective as a means to reduce extinction risk, using small or moderate-sized source populations rather than large source populations can greatly increase the effectiveness of genetic rescue due to greater purging in these smaller populations. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on maximizing genetic diversity to reduce extinction risk in favor of a view that emphasizes minimizing strongly deleterious variation. These insights have important implications for managing small and isolated populations in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.\n\nImpact SummaryNumerous threats to extinction exist for small populations, including the detrimental effects of inbreeding. Although much of the focus in reducing these harmful effects in small populations has been on maintaining high genetic diversity, here we use simulations to demonstrate that emphasis should instead be placed on minimizing strongly deleterious variation. More specifically, we show that historically-large populations with high levels of genetic diversity also harbor elevated levels of recessive strongly deleterious mutations hidden in the heterozygous state. Thus, when these populations contract, inbreeding can expose these strongly deleterious mutations as homozygous and lead to severe inbreeding depression and rapid extinction. Moreover, we demonstrate that, although translocating individuals to these small populations to perform a  genetic rescue is broadly beneficial, the effectiveness of this strategy can be greatly increased by targeting historically-smaller source populations where recessive strongly deleterious mutations have been purged. These results challenge long-standing views on how to best conserve small and isolated populations facing the threat of inbreeding depression, and have immediate implications for preserving biodiversity in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.",

    "abstract": "Understanding whether the spatial-temporal dynamics of the drinking water microbiome are reproducible in full-scale drinking water systems is an important step towards devising engineering strategies to manipulate it. Yet, direct comparisons across full-scale drinking water systems are challenging because multiple factors, from source water to treatment process choice and configuration, can be unique to each system. This study compared the spatial-temporal dynamics of the drinking water microbiome in two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) with identical sequence of treatment strategies treating source waters from the same river system and with treated drinking water distributed in same large-scale (but independent) distribution system (DWDS) with similar disinfectant residual regiment. Dissimilarities in source water communities were tempered by the pre-disinfection treatments, resulting in highly similar post-filtration microbial communities between the two systems. However, high community turnover due to disinfection resulted in highly dissimilar microbial communities in the finished water between the two systems. Interestingly however, the microbial communities in the two systems increased in similarity during transit through the DWDS despite presence of a disinfectant residual. Overall our study finds that the drinking water microbiome demonstrated reproducible spatial and temporal dynamics within both independent but nearly identical DWTPs and their corresponding DWDSs.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "A common goal of motor learning is generalizing newly learned movement patterns beyond the training context. Here we tested whether learning a new physical property of the arm during self-initiated reaching generalizes to new arm configurations. One hundred human participants performed a single-joint elbow reaching task and/or countered mechanical perturbations that created pure elbow motion. Participants did so with the shoulder joint either free to rotate or locked by the robotic manipulandum. With the shoulder free, we found activation of shoulder extensor muscles for pure elbow extension trials, as required to counter the interaction torques that arise at the shoulder due to forearm rotation. After locking the shoulder joint, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle activity that developed slowly over many trials. This reduction is appropriate because locking the shoulder joint cancels the interaction torques that arise at the shoulder to do forearm rotation and thus removes the need to activate shoulder muscles. In our first three experiments, we tested whether this reduction generalizes when reaching is self-initiated in (1) a different initial shoulder orientation, (2) a different initial elbow orientation and (3) for a different reach distance/speed. We found reliable generalization across initial shoulder orientation and reach distance/speed but not for initial elbow orientation. In our fourth experiment, we tested whether generalization is also transferred to feedback control by applying mechanical perturbations and observing reflex responses in a distinct shoulder orientation. We found robust transfer to feedback control.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyHere we show that learning to reduce shoulder muscles activity following shoulder fixation generalizes to other movement conditions but does not generalize globally, indicating that the nervous system does not implement such learning by modifying a general internal model of arm dynamics.\\n\\nDisclosuresThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "1Organisms must ensure that expression of genes is directed to the appropriate tissues at the correct times, while simultaneously ensuring that these gene regulatory systems are robust to perturbation. This idea is captured by a mathematical concept called r-robustness, which says that a system is robust to a perturbation in up to r - 1 randomly chosen parameters. In this work we use this idea to investigate the robustness of gene regulation using a sequence level model of the Drosophila melanogaster gene even-skipped. We find that gene regulation can be remarkably sensitive to changes in transcription factor concentrations at the boundaries of expression features, while it is robust to perturbation elsewhere. We also find that the length of sequence used to control an expression feature correlates negatively with the number of nucleotides that are sensitive to mutation in both natural and in silico predicted enhancers. In all cases, the exact degree of robustness obtained is dependent not only on DNA sequence, but also on the local concentration of regulatory factors. By analyzing both natural and synthetic sequences, we provide strong quantitative evidence that increased sequence length makes gene regulatory systems more robust to genetic perturbation.\\n\\n2 Author SummaryRobustness assures that organisms can survive when faced with unpredictable environments or genetic mutations. In this work, we characterize the robustness of gene regulation using an experimentally validated model of the regulation of the Drosophila gene even-skipped. We use a mathematically precise definition of robustness that allows us to make quantitative comparisons of robustness between different genetic sequences or between different nuclei. From this analysis, we found that genetic sequences that were not previously known to be important for gene regulation reduce sensitivity to genetic perturbation. In contrast, we found that gene regulation can be very sensitive to the levels of regulators. This extreme sensitivity was only observed at the boundaries of expression features, where switch-like behavior is desirable. This highlights the importance of considering context when assessing robustness.",

However, current non-Bayesian methods may produce unreliable CIs because they do not incorporate rate variation among lineages and interactions among clock calibrations properly. Here, we present a new analytical method to calculate CIs of divergence times estimated using the RelTime method, along with an approach to utilize multiple calibration uncertainty densities in these analyses. Empirical data analyses showed that the new methods produce CIs that overlap with Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. In the analysis of computer-simulated data, we found that RelTime CIs show excellent average coverage probabilities, i.e., the true time is contained within the CIs with a 95% probability. These developments will encourage broader use of computationally-efficient RelTime approach in molecular dating analyses and biological hypothesis testing.",

    "abstract": "The innovation of new therapies to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is being outpaced by the continued rise of MDR bacterial infections. Of particular concern are hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) recalcitrant to antibiotic therapies. The Gram-positive intestinal pathobiont Enterococcus faecalis is associated with HAIs and some strains are MDR. Therefore, novel strategies to control E. faecalis populations are needed. We previously characterized an E. faecalis Type II CRISPR-Cas system and demonstrated its utility in the sequence-specific removal of antibiotic resistance determinants. Here we present work describing the adaption of this CRISPR-Cas system into a constitutively expressed module encoded on a pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid that efficiently transfers to E. faecalis for the selective removal of antibiotic resistance genes. Using in vitro competition assays, we show that these CRISPR-Cas-encoding delivery plasmids, or CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials, can reduce the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in enterococcal populations in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deployment of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials in the murine intestine reduces the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant E. faecalis by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that E. faecalis donor strains harboring CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials are immune to uptake of antibiotic resistance determinants in vivo. Our results demonstrate that conjugative delivery of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials may be adaptable for future deployment from probiotic bacteria for exact targeting of defined MDR bacteria or for precision engineering of polymicrobial communities in the mammalian intestine.\\n\\nImportanceCRISPR-Cas nucleic acid targeting systems hold promise for the amelioration of multidrug-resistant enterococci, yet the utility of such tools in the context of the intestinal environment where enterococci reside is understudied. We describe the development of a CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial, deployed on a conjugative plasmid, for the targeted removal of antibiotic resistance genes from intestinal Enterococcus faecalis. We demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas targeting reduces antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis by several orders of magnitude in the intestine. Although barriers exist that influence the penetrance of the conjugative CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial among target recipient E. faecalis cells, the removal of antibiotic resistance genes in E. faecalis upon uptake of the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial is absolute. In addition, cells that obtain the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial are immunized against the acquisition of new antibiotic resistance genes.

In addition to their composition, the physico-chemical properties of these prebiological membranes would have been significantly affected and regulated by the physical environment that they were present in. In this study, the physico-chemical properties of two different chain length membrane systems were systematically characterized, under pertinent early Earth conditions. The membrane systems were designed to comprise a fatty acid and its alcohol and/or glycerol monoester derivative, to make a range of binary and tertiary vesicle combinations. Their properties were then evaluated as a function of multiple factors including their composition, stability under varying pH, Mg2+ ion concentrations and dilution regimes, and their permeability to small molecules. Our results demonstrate how these environmental constraints would have acted as important prebiotic selection pressures to shape the evolution of prebiological membranes. This study also illustrates how different fatty acid derivatives confer varying degree of stability when combined with their respective fatty acid moiety. Interestingly, when the membrane systems were subjected to multiple selection pressures in a consecutive manner, only the heterogeneous membrane systems survived the  race. Our results illustrate that compositionally diverse membrane systems are more stable and robust to multiple selection pressures, thereby making them more suitable for supporting protocellular life.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe physico-chemical environment would have played an important role in shaping the composition and evolution of primitive membrane systems. This study demonstrates the importance of compositional heterogeneity on the stability of protomembrane systems under pertinent prebiotic selection pressures. Two different fatty acid based systems were mixed with their respective alcohol and/or glycerol monoester derivatives, to generate combinations of binary and tertiary membrane systems. Increasing chain length effected the physical property of the membranes thus affecting their stability. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how the head groups of the derivatives employed in this study (e.g. glycerol monoester and alcohol) contribute differently towards stabilizing the mixed membranes under a given selection condition, by discerning the molecular mechanism underlying this process. Our results illustrate how multiple selection pressures would have preferentially supported the emergence of compositionally heterogeneous membrane systems.",

However, it is difficult to practically make use of the relationship between sequence and phenotype due to the complex relationship between sequence and folding or activity.\n\nResultsHere, we predict the originating species optimal growth temperatures of individual protein sequences using trained machine learning models.

    "abstract": "Calibrating the molecular clock is the most contentious step in every dating analysis, but the emerging total-evidence dating approach promises increased objectivity. It combines molecular and morphological data of extant and fossil taxa in a Bayesian framework. Information about absolute node ages stems from the inferred fossil placements and associated branch lengths, under the assumption of a morphological clock. We here use computer simulations to assess the impact of mismatch of the morphology model, such as misspecification of character states and transition rates, non-stationarity of the evolutionary process, and extensive variation of evolutionary rates among branches. Comparisons with published datasets suggest that, at least for evolutionary rates typically observed in discrete morphological characters, the total-evidence dating framework is surprisingly robust to these factors. We show that even with relatively low numbers of morphological characters sampled, extensive model mismatch is mostly irrelevant for the performance of the method. The only exception we found are cases of highly asymmetric state frequencies and thus transition rates, but these can be accounted for by appropriate morphology models. In contrast, we find that the temporal scope of fossil sampling has a major impact on divergence time estimates, with the time signal quickly eroding if only rather young fossils are included in an analysis. Our results suggest that total-evidence dating might work even without a good understanding of morphological evolution and that study design should instead focus on an adequate sampling of all relevant fossils, even those with highly incomplete preservation.",

    "abstract": "Selective sweeps are frequent and varied signatures in the genomes of natural populations, and detecting them is consequently important in understanding mechanisms of adaptation by natural selection. Following a selective sweep, haplotypic diversity surrounding the site under selection decreases, and this deviation from the background pattern of variation can be applied to identify sweeps. Multiple methods exist to locate selective sweeps in the genome from haplotype data, but none leverage the power of a model-based approach to make their inference. Here, we propose a likelihood ratio test statistic T to probe whole genome polymorphism datasets for selective sweep signatures. Our framework uses a simple but powerful model of haplotype frequency spectrum distortion to find sweeps and additionally make an inference on the number of presently sweeping haplotypes in a population. We found that the T statistic is suitable for detecting both hard and soft sweeps across a variety of demographic models, selection strengths, and ages of the beneficial allele. Accordingly, we applied the T statistic to variant calls from European and sub-Saharan African human populations, yielding primarily literature-supported candidates, including LCT, RSPH3, and ZNF211 in CEU, SYT1, RGS18, and NNT in YRI, and HLA genes in both populations. We also searched for sweep signatures in Drosophila melanogaster, finding expected candidates at Ace, Uhg1, and Pimet. Finally, we provide open-source software to compute the T statistic and the inferred number of presently sweeping haplotypes from whole-genome data.",

    "abstract": "The American Paint Horse Association (APHA) records pedigree and performance information for their breed, a stock-type horse valued as a working farm or ranch horse and as pleasure horses. As the name implies, the breed is also valued for attractive white spotting patterns on the coat. The APHA utilizes visual inspections of photographs to determine if coat spotting exceeds threshold anatomical landmarks considered characteristic of desirable patterns. Horses with sufficient white patterning enter the \"Regular\" registry, rather than the \"Solid Paint-bred\" division, providing a threshold modeled phenotype. Genetic studies previously defined sequence variants corresponding to 35 alleles for white spotting in the horse. Here, we calculate the allele frequency for nine common white spotting alleles in the American Paint horse using a sample of 1,054 registered animals. The APHA spotting phenotype is altered by additive interactions among spotting loci, and epistatically by the MC1R and ASIP genes controlling pigment production. The W20 allele within the KIT gene, independent of other known spotting alleles, was strongly associated with the APHA-defined white spotting phenotype (p = 1.86 x10-18), refuting reports that W20 acts only as a modifier of other underlying white spotting patterns. The parentage of an individual horse, either American Paint or American Quarter Horse, did not alter the likelihood of entering the APHA Regular registry. An empirical definition of the action of these genetic loci on the APHA-defined white spotting phenotype will allow more accurate application of genome-assisted selection for improving color production and marketability of APHA horses.",

Here, we show that the distinct rapid evolutionary cortical expansion of cognitive networks in the human brain, and most pronounced the DMN, runs parallel with high expression of genes important for human evolution (so-called HAR genes). Comparative gene expression examination then shows that HAR genes are more differentially expressed in cognitive networks in humans compared to the chimpanzee and macaque. Genes with distinct high expression in the DMN display broad involvement in the formation of synapses and dendrites. Next, we performed a genome-wide association analysis on functional MRI data, and show that HAR genes are associated with individual variations in DMN functional connectivity in todays human population. Finally, gene-set analysis suggests associations of HAR genes with intelligence, social cognition, and mental conditions such as schizophrenia and autism. Taken together, our results indicate that the expansion of higher-order functional networks and their cognitive properties have been an important locus of change in recent human brain evolution.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is linked to changes in fMRI task activations and fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC), which can emerge early in the timecourse of illness. Study of these fMRI correlates of unhealthy aging has been conducted in largely separate subfields. Taking inspiration from neural network simulations, we propose a unifying mechanism wherein restFC network alterations associated with Alzheimers disease disrupt the ability for activations to flow between brain regions, leading to aberrant task activations. We apply this activity flow modeling framework in a large sample of clinically unimpaired older adults, which was segregated into healthy (low-risk) and at-risk subgroups based on established imaging (positron emission tomography amyloid) and genetic (apolipoprotein) risk factors for AD. We identified healthy task activations in individuals at low risk for AD, and then by estimating activity flow using at-risk AD restFC data we were able to predict the altered at-risk AD task activations. Thus, modeling the flow of healthy activations over at-risk AD connectivity effectively transformed the healthy aged activations into unhealthy aged activations. These results provide evidence that activity flow over altered intrinsic functional connections may act as a mechanism underlying Alzheimers-related dysfunction, even in very early stages of the illness. Beyond these mechanistic insights linking restFC with cognitive task activations, this approach has potential clinical utility as it enables prediction of task activations and associated cognitive dysfunction in individuals without requiring them to perform in-scanner cognitive tasks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDeveloping analytic approaches that can reliably predict features of Alzheimers disease is a major goal for cognitive and clinical neuroscience, with particular emphasis on identifying such diagnostic features early in the timeline of disease. We demonstrate the utility of an activity flow modeling approach, which predicts fMRI cognitive task activations in subjects identified as at-risk for Alzheimers disease. The approach makes activation predictions by transforming a healthy aged activation template via the at-risk subjects individual pattern of fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC). The observed prediction accuracy supports activity flow as a mechanism linking age-related alterations in restFC and task activations, thereby providing a theoretical basis for incorporating restFC into imaging biomarker and personalized medicine interventions.",

    "abstract": "Glucose homeostasis and growth essentially depend on the peptide hormone insulin engaging its receptor. Despite biochemical and structural advances, a fundamental contradiction has persisted in the current understanding of insulin ligand-receptor interactions. While biochemistry predicts two distinct insulin binding sites, 1 and 2, recent structural analyses have only resolved site 1. Using a combined approach of cryo-EM and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin molecules. Complementing the previously described insulin-site 1 interaction, we present the first view of insulin bound to the discrete insulin receptor site 2. Insulin binding stabilizes the receptor ectodomain in a T-shaped conformation wherein the membrane-proximal domains converge and contact each other. These findings expand the current models of insulin binding to its receptor and of its regulation. In summary, we provide the structural basis enabling a comprehensive description of ligand-receptor interactions that ultimately will inform new approaches to structure-based drug design.\\n\\nIn briefA cryo-EM structure of the complete insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin ligands is reported. The structural model of the insulin-insulin receptor complex adopts a T-shaped conformation, reveals two additional insulin-binding sites potentially involved in the initial interaction of insulin with its receptor, and resolves the membrane proximal region.",

    "abstract": "At their early age, a large proportion of island pools were a partial sampling of mainland pools whatever islands are oceanic or fragments of the mainland. Through time, colonization, diversification, extinctions, have deeply transformed insular and continental communities and therefore the degree to which they share species. We studied the relative importance of these mechanisms by looking at the shared evolutionary history between species pools on islands and continents. Indeed, most of these mechanisms are not neutral regarding phylogeny but are linked to species evolutionary relationships. We measured the phylogenetic divergence between continental and insular monocot communities through metrics of beta Mean Pairwise Distance and beta Mean Nearest Taxon Distance. We first tested the influence of spatial and environmental distance to the continent, two main factors of divergence, but whose explanatory power in a phylogenetic context was still unclear. We showed that both dispersal and enviromental filtering were important to explain divergence, although species that could pass these filters were not phylogenetically clustered. There was however a clear distinction between oceanic and continental islands: a stable climate in the latters was key to the survival of the original biota leading to a high proportion of shared lineages between the mainland and islands. But distance to the continent was only part of the story, we investigated additionnal mechanisms of phylogenetic divergence through their relation to island features and community structure. This showed that the most divergent islands occurred in the tropics and that processes of persistence of original species, diversification in remote archipelagos, neutral colonization on easy-to-reach islands, turnover, and high speciation rates may have driven phylogenetic divergence at a world scale. This study showed how phylogenetic approaches may explain how divergence, or similarity may have arisen and provide new insights in the continental origin of plant diversity on islands.",

    "abstract": "Many conflicting hypotheses regarding the relationships among crops and wild species closely related to wheat (the genera Aegilops, Amblyopyrum, and Triticum) have been postulated. The contribution of hybridization to the evolution of these taxa is intensely discussed. To determine possible causes for this, and provide a phylogeny of the diploid taxa based on genome-wide sequence information, independent data was obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing and a target-enrichment experiment that returned 244 low-copy nuclear loci. The data were analyzed with Bayesian, likelihood and coalescent-based methods. D statistics were used to test if incomplete lineage sorting alone or together with hybridization is the source for incongruent gene trees. Here we present the phylogeny of all diploid species of the wheat wild relatives. We hypothesize that most of the wheat-group species were shaped by a primordial homoploid hybrid speciation event involving the ancestral Triticum and Am. muticum lineages to form all other species but Ae. speltoides. This hybridization event was followed by multiple introgressions affecting all taxa but Triticum. Mostly progenitors of the extant species were involved in these processes, while recent interspecific gene flow seems insignificant. The composite nature of many genomes of wheat group taxa results in complicated patterns of diploid contributions when these lineages are involved in polyploid formation, which is, for example, the case in the tetra-and hexaploid wheats. Our analysis provides phylogenetic relationships and a testable hypothesis for the genome compositions in the basic evolutionary units within the wheat group of Triticeae.",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies seek to uncover the link between genotype and phenotype, and often utilize inbred reference panels as a replicable source of genetic variation. However, inbred reference panels can differ substantially from wild populations in their genotypic distribution, patterns of linkage-disequilibrium, and nucleotide diversity. As a result, associations discovered using inbred reference panels may not reflect the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in natural populations. To address this problem, we evaluated a mapping population design where dozens to hundreds of inbred lines are outbred for few generations, which we call the Hybrid Swarm. The Hybrid Swarm approach has likely remained underutilized relative to pre-sequenced inbred lines due to the costs of genome-wide genotyping. To reduce sequencing costs and make the Hybrid Swarm approach feasible, we developed a computational pipeline that reconstructs accurate whole genomes from ultra-low-coverage (0.05X) sequence data in Hybrid Swarm populations derived from ancestors with phased haplotypes. We evaluate reconstructions using genetic variation from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel as well as variation from neutral simulations. We compared the power and precision of GWAS using the Hybrid Swarm, inbred lines, recombinant inbred lines, and highly outbred populations across a range of allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. Our simulations show that these different mapping panels vary in their power and precision, largely depending on the architecture of the trait. The Hybrid Swam and RILs outperform inbred lines for quantitative traits, but not for monogenic ones. Taken together, our results demonstrate the feasibility of the Hybrid Swarm as a cost-effective method of fine-scale genetic mapping.",

    "abstract": "Access to cis-regulatory elements packaged in chromatin is essential for directing gene expression and cell viability. Here, we report a super-resolution imaging strategy, 3D ATAC-PALM, that enables direct visualization of the entire accessible genome. We found that active chromosomal segments are organized into spatially-segregated accessible chromatin domains (ACDs). Rapid depletion of CTCF or Cohesin (RAD21 subunit) induced enhanced ACD clustering, reduced physical separation between intrachromosomal ACDs, and differentially regulated ACD compaction. Experimental perturbations and polymer modeling suggest that dynamic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within ACDs couple with loop extrusion to organize ACD topology. Dysorganization of ACDs upon CTCF or Cohesin loss alters transcription factor binding and target search dynamics in living cells. These results uncover fundamental mechanisms underpinning the formation of 3D genome architecture and its pivotal function in transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) is a midbrain region implicated in a variety of motivated behaviors. However, the function of VTA GABAergic (Vgat+) neurons remains poorly understood. Here, using 3D motion capture, in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we demonstrate a novel function of VTAVgat+ neurons. We found three distinct populations of neurons, each representing head angle about a principal axis of rotation: pitch, roll, and yaw. For each axis, opponent cell groups were found that increase firing when the head moves in one direction, and decrease firing in the opposite direction. Selective excitation and inhibition of VTAVgat+ neurons generate opposite rotational movements. The relationship between these neurons and head angle is degraded only at the time of reward consumption, at which point all head-angle related neuronal subpopulations show indistinguishable reward-related responses. Thus, VTAVgat+ neurons serve a critical role in the control of rotational kinematics while pursuing a moving target. This general-purpose steering function can guide animals toward desired spatial targets in any motivated behavior.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an influx of therapies aimed at targeting the biological aging process. While many hold promise for potentially delaying the simultaneous onset of multiple chronic conditions, a major hurdle in developing interventions to slow human aging is the lack of reliable and valid endpoints from which to evaluate potential candidates. The aim of this study was to develop a biomarker that could serve as a potential endophenotype in evaluation of one of the most promising and exciting aging therapeutics being developed--senolytics. Senolytics are compounds which selectively clear senescent cells by targeting anti-apoptotic pathways. Using DNAm data from fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in culture, we developed a predictor of cellular senescence that related to three distinct senescence inducers (replicative, oncogene induced (OIS), and ionizing radiation (IR)). Our measure, termed DNAmSen, showed expected classification of validation data from embryonic stem cells (ESC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and near senescent cells in culture. Further, using bulk data from whole blood, peripheral tissue samples, and postmortem tissue, we observed robust correlations between age and DNAmSen. We also observed age adjusted associations between DNAmSen and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPS), COPD, lung cancer, and Werner syndrome compared to controls. When characterizing the 88 CpGs in the DNAmSen measure, we observed a enrichment for those located in enhancer regions and regulatory regions marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Interestingly most of the CpGs were observed to be moderately hypomethyled in early passage cells, yet exhibited further hypomethylation upon induction of cellular senescence, suggesting senescence is accompanied by programmatic alterations to the epigenome, rather than entropic drift.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in early detection and treatment, invasion and metastasis of breast tumors remains a major hurdle. Cystatin A (CSTA, also called stefin A), an estrogen-regulated gene in breast cancer cells, is an inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, and a purported tumor suppressor. Loss of CSTA expression in breast tumors evidently shifts the balance in favor of cysteine cathepsins, thereby promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism behind the loss of CSTA expression in breast tumors is not known. Here, we have analyzed CSTA expression, and methylation of upstream and intron-2 CpG sites within the CSTA locus in human breast cancer cell lines and breast tumors of the TCGA cohort. Results showed an inverse relationship between expression and methylation. Sequence analysis revealed a potential estrogen response element (ERE) in the intron-2. Analysis of ChIP-seq data (ERP000380) and our own ChIP experiments showed that 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) enhanced ER binding to this ERE in MCF-7 cells. This ERE was located amidst the differentially methylated intron-2 CpG sites, which provoked us to examine the possible conflict between estrogen-regulation of CSTA and DNA methylation in the intron-2. We analyzed the expression of CSTA and its regulation by estrogen in MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells subjected to global demethylation by 5-azacytidine (5-aza). 5-aza, not only enhanced CSTA expression in these cell lines but also restored estrogen-regulation of CSTA in these cells. Taken together, our results indicate that DNA methylation-dependent silencing could play a significant role in the loss of CSTA expression in breast tumors. The potential of DNA methylation as an indicator of CSTA expression or as a marker of tumor progression can be explored in future investigations. Furthermore, our results indicate the convergence of ER-mediated estrogen regulation and DNA methylation in the intron-2, thereby offering a novel context to understand the role of estrogen-ER signaling axis in breast tumor invasion and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the extent of genetic differentiation between populations is an important measure in population genetics, ecology and evolutionary biology. Fixation index or FST is an important measure, which is routinely used to quantify this. Previous studies have shown that FST estimated for selectively constrained regions was significantly lower than that estimated for neutral regions. By deriving the theoretical relationship between FST at neutral and constrained sites we show that an excess in the fraction of deleterious variations segregating within populations compared to that segregates between populations is the cause for the reduction in FST estimated at constrained sites. Using whole genome data, our results revealed that the magnitude of reduction in FST estimates obtained for selectively constrained regions was much higher for distantly related populations compared to those estimated for closely related pairs. For example, the reduction was 49% for comparison between European-African populations, 31% for European-Asian comparison, 16% for the Northern-Southern European pair and only 4% for the comparison involving two Southern European (Italian and Spanish) populations. Since deleterious variants are purged over time due to purifying selection, their contribution to the among population diversity at constrained sites decreases with the increase in the divergence between populations. However, within population diversity remain the same for all pairs compared above and therefore FST estimated at constrained sites for distantly related populations are much smaller than those estimated for closely related populations. Our results suggest that the level of population divergence should be considered when comparing constrained site FST estimates obtained for different pairs of populations.",

    "abstract": "In multisite neuroimaging studies there is often unwanted technical variation across scanners and sites. These \\\"scanner effects\\\" can hinder detection of biological features of interest, produce inconsistent results, and lead to spurious associations. We assess scanner effects in two brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies where subjects were measured on multiple scanners within a short time frame, so that one could assume any differences between images were due to technical rather than biological effects. We propose mica (multisite image harmonization by CDF alignment), a tool to harmonize images taken on different scanners by identifying and removing within-subject scanner effects. Our goals in the present study were to (1) establish a method that removes scanner effects by leveraging multiple scans collected on the same subject, and, building on this, (2) develop a technique to quantify scanner effects in large multisite trials so these can be reduced as a preprocessing step. We found that unharmonized images were highly variable across site and scanner type, and our method effectively removed this variability by warping intensity distributions. We further studied the ability to predict intensity harmonization results for a scan taken on an existing subject at a new site using cross-validation.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a critical regulator of synapse development and function. However, mechanisms that regulate the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that are responsible for the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins are poorly understood. We previously showed that the DUB USP-46 removes ubiquitin from the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and regulates it trafficking and degradation in C. elegans. We found that WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of USP-46. Here, we identify another mechanism by which WDR-48 regulates USP-46. We found that increased expression of WDR-48, but not WDR-20, promotes USP-46 abundance in mammalian cells in culture and in C. elegans neurons in vivo. Inhibition of the proteasome promotes the abundance of USP-46, and this effect is non-additive with increased expression of WDR-48. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated, and expression of WDR-48 reduces the levels of ubiquitin-USP-46 conjugates and increases the half-life of USP-46. A point mutant version of WDR-48 that disrupts binding to USP-46 is unable to promote USP-46 abundance in vivo. Together, these data support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism to control DUB availability and function.",

    "abstract": "Converting habitat for agricultural production threatens biodiversity loss worldwide and has significant implications for human well-being. Debates on how to conserve biodiversity as the demand for agriculture products rises is being informed by studies using habitat specificity as a proxy for sensitivity to land modification, assuming all species respond to habitat loss and fragmentation relative to their affinity towards the habitat type being converted. Here, we test this assumption among rodent assemblages on the Canadian Prairies, hypothesizing negative responses among grassland obligates and neutral or positive responses among habitat generalists to landscape change along a gradient of increasing agricultural intensity. We found complex, sometimes contradictory responses among rodent species, which depended on the magnitude of habitat loss that had occurred and did not always reflect each species relative affinity for grassland habitat. Our results suggest future studies should avoid assuming a single habitat type appropriately characterizes resource limitation among all species, and instead carefully consider which dimension of the ecological niche defines specificity for each species. Our results indicate habitat specificity is not always a reliable proxy for sensitivity to land modification, with significant implications for biodiversity conservation when used to inform agriculture and land use policies.",

    "abstract": "Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal childhood epilepsy and a non-classical glycogen storage disorder with no effective therapy or cure. LD is caused by recessive mutations in the EPM2A or EPM2B genes that encode the glycogen phosphatase laforin and an E3 ubiquitin ligase malin, respectively. A hallmark of LD is the intracellular accumulation of abnormal and insoluble -linked polysaccharide deposits known as Lafora bodies (LBs) in several tissues, including most regions of the brain. In mouse models of LD, genetic reduction of glycogen synthesis eliminates LB formation and rescues the neurological phenotype. Since multiple groups have confirmed that neurodegeneration and epilepsy result from LB accumulation, a major focus in the field has shifted toward the development of therapies that reduce glycogen synthesis or target LBs for degradation with the goal of treating LD. Herein, we identify the optimal enzymes for degrading LBs, and we develop a novel therapeutic agent by fusing human pancreatic -amylase to a cellpenetrating antibody fragment. This antibody-enzyme fusion (VAL-0417) degrades LBs in vitro, shows robust cellular uptake, and significantly reduces the LB load in vivo in Epm2a-/- mice. VAL-0417 is a promising therapeutic for the treatment of LD and a putative precision therapy for an intractable epilepsy. Antibody-enzyme fusions represent a new class of antibody-based drugs that could be utilized to treat glycogen storage disorders and other diseases.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAn antibody-enzyme fusion delivering an amylase degrades the toxic polyglucosan bodies that cause Lafora disease, a fatal childhood epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe molecular chaperone TRAP1, the mitochondrial isoform of cytosolic HSP90, remains poorly understood with respect to its pivotal role in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Most studies have found it to be an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and an inducer of the Warburg phenotype of cancer cells. However, others have reported the opposite and there is no consensus on the relevant TRAP1 interactors. This calls for a more comprehensive analysis of the TRAP1 interactome and of how TRAP1 and mitochondrial metabolism mutually affect each other.\\n\\nResultsWe show that the disruption of the gene for TRAP1 in a panel of cell lines dysregulates OXPHOS by a metabolic rewiring that induces the anaplerotic utilization of glutamine metabolism to replenish TCA cycle intermediates. Restoration of wild-type levels of OXPHOS requires full-length TRAP1. Whereas the TRAP1 ATPase activity is dispensable for this function, it modulates the interactions of TRAP1 with various mitochondrial proteins. Quantitatively by far the major interactors of TRAP1 are the mitochondrial chaperones mtHSP70 and HSP60. However, we find that the most stable stoichiometric TRAP1 complex is a TRAP1 tetramer, whose levels change in response to both a decline or an increase in OXPHOS.\\n\\nConclusionsOur work provides a roadmap for further investigations of how TRAP1 and its interactors such as the ATP synthase regulate cellular energy metabolism. Our results highlight that TRAP1 function in metabolism and cancer cannot be understood without a focus on TRAP1 tetramers as potentially the most relevant functional entity.",

BV is responsible for more than 60% of vulvovaginal infections and has been linked to serious, potentially life-threatening conditions, including: pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative infections, acquisition and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, preterm birth, and several adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our research showed that 3 monthly cycles of Polybactum(R) ovules administered after one course of metronidazole vaginal therapy can reduce the rate of Bacterial vaginosis recurrence and improve the vaginal milieu, favouring the growth of vaginal lactobacillus species. Taken together our results confirm that Polibactum(R) is a safe and effective treatment to reduce BV recurrence rate after a first line therapy with metronidazole.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe digits-in-noise test (DIN) has become increasingly popular as a consumer-based method to screen for hearing loss. Current versions of all DINs either test ears monaurally or present identical stimuli binaurally (i.e., diotic noise and speech, NoSo). Unfortunately, presentation of identical stimuli to each ear inhibits detection of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and neither diotic nor monaural presentation sensitively detects conductive hearing loss (CHL). Following an earlier finding of enhanced sensitivity in normally hearing listeners, this study tested the hypothesis that interaural antiphasic digit presentation (NoS{pi}) would improve sensitivity to hearing loss caused by unilateral or asymmetric SNHL, symmetric SNHL, or CHL.\\n\\nDesignThis cross-sectional study, recruited adults (18-84 years) with various levels of hearing, based on a four-frequency pure tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz. The study sample was comprised of listeners with normal hearing (n=41; PTA [&le;] 25 dB HL in both ears), symmetric SNHL (n=57; PTA > 25 dB HL), unilateral or asymmetric SNHL (n=24; PTA > 25 dB HL in the poorer ear) and CHL (n=23; PTA > 25 dB HL and PTA air-bone gap [&ge;] 20 dB HL in the poorer ear). Antiphasic and diotic speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were compared using a repeated-measures design.\\n\\nResultsAntiphasic DIN was significantly more sensitive to all three forms of hearing loss than the diotic DIN. SRT test-retest reliability was high for all tests (ICC r > 0.89). Area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for detection of hearing loss (> 25 dB HL) was higher for antiphasic DIN (0.94) than for diotic DIN (0.77) presentation. After correcting for age, PTA of listeners with normal hearing or symmetric SNHL was more strongly correlated with antiphasic (rpartial[96]=0.69) than diotic (rpartial=0.54) SRTs. Slope of fitted regression lines predicting SRT from PTA was significantly steeper for antiphasic than diotic DIN. For listeners with normal hearing or CHL, antiphasic SRTs were more strongly correlated with PTA (rpartial[62]=0.92) than diotic SRTs (rpartial[62]=0.64). Slope of regression line with PTA was also significantly steeper for antiphasic than diotic DIN. Severity of asymmetric hearing loss (poorer ear PTA) was unrelated to SRT. No effect of self-reported English competence on either antiphasic or diotic DIN among the mixed first-language participants was observed\\n\\nConclusionsAntiphasic digit presentation markedly improved the sensitivity of the DIN test to detect SNHL, either symmetric or asymmetric, while keeping test duration to a minimum by testing binaurally. In addition, the antiphasic DIN was able to detect CHL, a shortcoming of previous monaural or binaurally diotic DIN versions. The antiphasic DIN is thus a powerful tool for population-based screening. This enhanced functionality combined with smartphone delivery could make the antiphasic DIN suitable as a primary screen that is accessible to a large global audience.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin looping is exceedingly important to gene regulation and a host of other nuclear processes. Many recent insights into 3D chromatin structure across species and cell types have contributed to our understanding of the principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome evolution and how it relates to Mendelian selection remain largely unexplored. CTCF, an insulator protein found at most loop anchors, has been described as the \\\"master weaver\\\" of mammalian genomes, and variations in CTCF occupancy are known to influence looping divergence. A large fraction of mammalian CTCF binding sites fall within transposable elements (TEs) but their contributions to looping variation are unknown. Here we investigated the effect of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions on chromatin looping in human and mouse.\\n\\nResultsTEs have broadly contributed to CTCF binding and loop boundary specification, primarily forming variable loops across species and cell types and contributing nearly 1/3 of species-specific and cell-specific loops.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that TE activity is a major source of looping variability across species and cell types. Thus, TE-mediated CTCF expansions explain a large fraction of population-level looping variation and may play a role in adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is particularly challenging in pericentromeric heterochromatin, where the abundance of repeated sequences exacerbates the risk of ectopic recombination. In Drosophila Kc cells, accurate homologous recombination (HR) repair of heterochromatic DSBs relies on the relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery before Rad51 recruitment and strand invasion. This movement is driven by Arp2/3-dependent nuclear actin filaments and myosins ability to walk along them. Conserved mechanisms enable the relocalization of heterochromatic DSBs in mouse cells, and their defects lead to massive ectopic recombination in heterochromatin and chromosome rearrangements. In Drosophila polytene chromosomes, extensive DNA movement is blocked by a stiff structure of chromosome bundles. Repair pathways in this context are poorly characterized, and whether heterochromatic DSBs relocalize in these cells is unknown. Here, we show that damage in heterochromatin results in relaxation of the heterochromatic chromocenter, consistent with a dynamic response in this structure. Arp2/3, the Arp2/3 activator Scar, and the myosin activator Unc45, are required for heterochromatin stability in polytene cells, suggesting that relocalization enables heterochromatin repair in this tissue. Together, these studies reveal critical roles for actin polymerization and myosin motors in heterochromatin repair and genome stability across different organisms and tissue types.\\n\\nImpact StatementHeterochromatin relies on dedicated pathways for  safe recombinational repair. In mouse and fly cultured cells, DNA repair requires the movement of repair sites away from the heterochromatin  domain via nuclear actin filaments and myosins. Here, we explore the importance of these pathways in Drosophila salivary gland cells, which feature a stiff bundle of endoreduplicated polytene chromosomes. Repair pathways in polytene chromosomes are largely obscure and how nuclear dynamics operate in this context is unknown. We show that heterochromatin relaxes in response to damage, and relocalization pathways are necessary for repair and stability of heterochromatic sequences. This deepens our understanding of repair mechanisms in polytenes, revealing unexpected dynamics. It also provides a first understanding of nuclear dynamics responding to replication damage or rDNA breaks, providing a new understanding of the importance of the nucleoskeleton in genome stability. We expect these discoveries to shed light on tumorigenic processes, including therapy-induced cancer relapses.",

This number of women is still too high. To lower this number, more information about the molecular players in breast cancer are needed. Several members of the Guanylate-Binding Proteins (GBPs) have been correlated with better prognosis in breast cancer. In this study, we asked if the expression of GBP-2 in breast cancer merely provided a biomarker for improved prognosis or whether it actually contributed to improving outcome. Specifically, we asked whether murine GBP-2 exhibited cell autonomous behavior that altered breast cancer cells in a manner predicted to improve prognosis. To answer this, the 4T1 model of murine Triple-Negative Breast Cancer was used. 4T1 cells themselves are highly aggressive and highly metastatic, while 67NR cells, isolated from the same tumor, do not leave the primary site. mGBP-2 did not alter cell proliferation in these two cell lines, but mGBP-2 expression inversely correlated with migration. More specifically, mGBP-2 inhibits cell migration and invadopodia formation by inhibiting the activation of Rac1, while promoting the activation of CDC42 and RhoA. Together these data demonstrate that mGBP-2 is responsible for cell autonomous activities that make breast cancer cells less aggressive.",

    "abstract": "How temporal cues combine with spatial inputs to control gene expression during development is poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Drosophila transcription factor E93 controls temporal gene expression by regulating chromatin accessibility. Precocious expression of E93 early in wing development reveals that it can simultaneously activate and deactivate different target enhancers. Notably, the precocious patterns of enhancer activity resemble the wild-type patterns that occur later in development, suggesting that provision of E93 alters the competence of enhancers to respond to spatial cues. Genomic profiling reveals that precocious E93 expression is sufficient to regulate chromatin accessibility at a subset of its targets. These accessibility changes mimic those that normally occur later in development, indicating that precocious E93 accelerates the wild-type developmental program. Further, we find that target enhancers that do not respond to precocious E93 in early wings become responsive after a developmental transition, suggesting that parallel temporal pathways work alongside E93. These findings support a model wherein E93 expression functions as an instructive cue that defines a broad window of developmental time through control of chromatin accessibility.",

We found that loss of TRESK in all trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons preferentially increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter TG nociceptors that express neuropeptide CGRP or TRPM8 channels. Surprisingly, loss of TRESK increased the number of TG neurons expressing TRPV1 channels. In dorsal root ganglia neurons, neither the persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was affected by the loss of TRESK. Compared with wild-type controls, TRESK knockout mice exhibited more robust trigeminal pain, especially headache-like behaviors; but displayed normal body and visceral pain responses. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity is required for trigeminal pain regulation. A substantial reduction of TRESK activity may selectively affect the functions of TG nociceptors, thereby increasing the susceptibility to migraine headache in humans.",
