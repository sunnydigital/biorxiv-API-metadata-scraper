    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technology, the gene editing potential of CRISPR/Cas9 is hampered by low efficiency, especially for clinical applications. One of the major challenges is that chromatin compaction inevitably limits the Cas9 protein access to the target DNA. However, chromatin compaction is precisely regulated by histone acetylation and deacetylation. To overcome these challenges, we have comprehensively assessed the impacts of histone modifiers such as HDAC (1-9) inhibitors and HAT (p300/CBP, Tip60 and MOZ) inhibitors, on CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that attenuation of HDAC1, HDAC2 activity, but not other HDACs, enhances CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout frequencies by NHEJ as well as gene knock-in by HDR. Conversely, inhibition of HDAC3 decreases gene editing frequencies. Furthermore, our study showed that attenuation of HDAC1, HDAC2 activity leads to an open chromatin state, facilitates Cas9 access and binding to the targeted DNA and increases the gene editing frequencies. This approach can be applied to other nucleases, such as ZFN and TALEN.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA growing body of literature suggests etiological overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and some cases of autism, although this relationship is poorly delineated. In addition, immune, autonomic, and endocrine dysregulation are reported in both conditions and may be relevant to their respective etiologies.\\n\\nAimsTo study symptom overlap in these two comorbid spectrum conditions.\\n\\nMethods and ProceduresWe surveyed 702 adults aged 25+ years on a variety of EDS/HSD-related health topics, comparing individuals with EDS/HSD, autism, and unaffected controls.\\n\\nOutcomes and ResultsThe autism group reported similar though less severe symptomology as the EDS/HSD group, especially in areas of immune/autonomic/endocrine dysregulation, connective tissue abnormalities (i.e., skin, bruising/bleeding), and chronic pain. EDS/HSD mothers with autistic children reported more immune symptoms than EDS/HSD mothers without, suggesting the maternal immune system could play a heritable role in these conditions (p = 0.0119).\\n\\nConclusions and ImplicationsThese data suggest that EDS/HSD and autism share aspects of immune/autonomic/endocrine dysregulation, pain, and some tissue fragility, which is typically more severe in the former. This overlap, as well as documented comorbidity, suggests some forms of autism may be hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTD).",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging method ideally suited for non-invasive studies of brain dynamics. MEGs spatial resolution critically depends on the approach used to solve the ill-posed inverse problem in order to transform sensor signals into cortical activation maps. Over recent years non-globally optimized solutions based on the use of adaptive beamformers (BF) gained popularity.\n\nWhen operating in the environment with a small number of uncorrelated sources the BFs perform optimally and yield spatial super-resolution. However, the BFs are known to fail when dealing with correlated sources acting like poorly tuned spatial filters with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the output timeseries and often meaningless cortical maps of power distribution.\n\nThis fact poses a serious limitation on the broader use of this promising technique especially since fundamental mechanisms of brain functioning, its inherent symmetry and task-based experimental paradigms result into a great deal of correlation in the activity of cortical sources. To cope with this problem, we developed a novel beamformer approach that preserves high spatial resolution in the environments with correlated sources.\n\nAt the core of our method is a projection operation applied to the vectorized sensor-space covariance matrix. This projection does not remove the activity of the correlated sources from the sensor-space covariance matrix but rather selectively handles their contributions to the covariance matrix and creates a sufficiently accurate approximation of an ideal data covariance that could hypothetically be observed should these sources be uncorrelated. Since the projection operation is reciprocal to the PSIICOS method developed by us earlier (Ossadtchi et al. (2018)) we refer to the family of algorithms presented here as ReciPSIICOS.\n\nWe asses the performance of the novel approach using realistically simulated MEG data and show its superior performance in comparison to the well established MNE and classical BF approaches. We have also applied our approach to the MEG datasets from the two experiments involving two different auditory tasks.\n\nThe analysis of experimental MEG datasets showed that beamformers from ReciPSIICOS family, but not MNE and the classical BF, discovered the expected bilateral focal sources in the primary auditory cortex and detected motor cortex activity associated with the audio-motor task. Moreover, ReciPSIICOS beamformers yielded cortical activity estimates with amplitude an order of magnitude higher than that obtained with the classical BF, which indicates the severeness of the signal cancellation problem when applying classical beamformers to MEG signals generated by synchronous sources.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiologic studies have characterized ion channels in lacrimal gland acinar cells, but due to relative paucity and inaccessibility, such studies on lacrimal gland duct cells are challenging. The duct cells are believed to secrete the high level of K+ that is present in tears. The goal of this project was to develop a method for isolation of viable, single duct cells, demonstrate their utility for patch-clamp recording and characterize the K+ channels expressed by duct cells. Exorbital lacrimal gland slices from Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with collagenase. Under a microscope, the ducts were microdissected from the glands and then incubated with elastase and collagenase. Dispersed duct cells were plated on a cover slip coated with BD Cell-Tak. Duct cells were distinguished from acinar cells by their smaller size and lack of granularity. Whole-cell K+ currents were recorded from duct cells using the perforated-patch technique and pipettes with resistances of less than 10 M{Omega}. EGTA and CaCl2 in the pipette solution were adjusted to give 1 uM free Ca++. When held at -80 mV, duct cells showed K+ currents that activated at command voltages near 0 mV and reached amplitudes near 1 nA at +100 mV. Currents reached peak amplitude less than 20 ms after depolarization and did not inactivate. These currents were inactivated by holding the cells at 0 mV. Currents were blocked reversibly by TEA in the presence of Ca2+, but were not blocked by TEA in the absence of Ca2+. Currents were not affected by clotrimazole (10 uM) or Ba2+ (5 mM). A method has been established for isolation and dissociation lacrimal gland duct cells for electrophysiologic studies. These cells express a voltage-activated K+ channel that is dependent on the presence of intracellular Ca2+ and may correspond to the IKCa1 channel expressed on the apical membranes of lacrimal gland ducts.",

We present scBatch, a numerical algorithm that conducts batch effect correction on the count matrix of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Different from traditional methods, scBatch starts with establishing an ideal correction of the sample distance matrix that effectively reflect the underlying biological subgroups, without considering the actual correction of the raw count matrix itself. It then seeks an optimal linear transformation of the count matrix to approximate the established sample pattern. The benefit of such an approach is the final result is not restricted by assumptions on the mechanism of the batch effect. As a result, the method yields good clustering and gene differential expression (DE) results. We compared the new method, scBatch, with leading batch effect removal methods ComBat and mnnCorrect on simulated data, real bulk RNA-seq data, and real single-cell RNA-seq data. The comparisons demonstrated that scBatch achieved better sample clustering and DE gene detection results.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key regulator of protein function in signal transduction pathways. Kinases are the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of other proteins in a target specific manner. The dysregulation of phosphorylation is associated with many diseases including cancer. Although the advances in phosphoproteomics enable the identification of phosphosites at the proteome level, most of the phosphoproteome is still in the dark: more than 95% of the reported human phosphosites have no known kinases. Determining which kinase is responsible for phosphorylating a site remains an experimental challenge. Existing computational methods require several examples of known targets of a kinase to make accurate kinase specific predictions, yet for a large body of kinases, only a few or no target sites are reported. We present DeepKinZero, the first zero-shot learning approach to predict the kinase acting on a phosphosite for kinases with no known phosphosite information. DeepKinZero transfers knowledge from kinases with many known target phosphosites to those kinases with no known sites through a zero-shot learning model. The kinase specific positional amino acid preferences are learned using a bidirectional recurrent neural network. We show that DeepKinZero achieves significant improvement in accuracy for kinases with no known phosphosites in comparison to the baseline model and other methods available. By expanding our knowledge on understudied kinases, DeepKinZero can help to chart the phosphoproteome atlas.",

    "abstract": "Existing drug therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including sorafenib, extend patient survival by only three months. We sought to identify novel druggable targets for use in combination with sorafenib to increase its efficacy. We implemented an in vivo genetic screening paradigm utilizing a library of 43 genes-of-interest expressed in the context of repopulation of the injured livers of Fumarylacetoacetate Hydrolase-deficient (Fah-/-) mice, which led to highly penetrant HCC. We then treated mice with vehicle or sorafenib to discover genetic determinants of sensitivity and resistance. Liver X Receptor alpha (LXR) emerged as a potential target. To examine LXR agonism in combination with sorafenib treatment, we added varying concentrations of sorafenib and LXR agonist drugs to HCC cell lines. We performed transcriptomic analysis to elucidate the mechanisms of HCC death. Fah-/- mice injected with the screening library developed HCC tumor clones containing Myc cDNA plus various other cDNAs. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in sorafenib-resistant HCCs that were significantly depleted in Nr1h3 cDNA, encoding LXR, suggesting that LXR activation is incompatible with tumor growth in the presence of sorafenib treatment in vivo. The combination of sorafenib and LXR agonism led to enhanced cell death as compared to monotherapy in multiple HCC cell lines, due to reduced expression of cell cycle regulators and increased expression of genes associated with apoptosis. Combination therapy also enhanced cell death in a sorafenib-resistant primary human HCC cell line. Our novel in vivo screen led to the discovery that LXR agonist drugs potentiate the efficacy of sorafenib in treating HCC.",

Mice lacking IL10 have enhanced thermogenesis, but the roles of specific cell types in the metabolic response to IL10 remain to be defined. We demonstrate here that selective loss of IL10 receptor  in adipocytes recapitulates the beneficial effects of global IL10 deletion, and that local crosstalk between IL10-producing immune cells and adipocytes is a determinant of thermogenesis and systemic energy balance. Single Nuclei Adipocyte RNA-sequencing (SNAP-seq) of subcutaneous adipose tissue defined a metabolically-active mature adipocyte subtype characterized by robust expression of genes involved in thermogenesis whose transcriptome was selectively responsive to IL10R deletion. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adipose stromal populations identified lymphocytes as a key source of IL10 production in response to thermogenic stimuli. These findings implicate adaptive immune cell-adipocyte communication in the maintenance of adipose subtype identity and function.",

    "abstract": "Small-diameter vesicular glutamate transporter 3-lineage (Vglut3lineage) dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play an important role in mechanosensation and thermal hypersensitivity; however, little is known about their intrinsic electrical properties. We therefore set out to investigate mechanisms of excitability within this population. Calcium microfluorimetry analysis of male and female mouse DRG neurons demonstrated that the cooling compound menthol selectively activates a subset of Vglut3lineage neurons. Whole-cell recordings showed that small-diameter Vglut3lineage DRG neurons fire menthol-evoked action potentials and exhibited robust, transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)-dependent discharges at room temperature. This heightened excitability was confirmed by current-clamp and action potential phase-plot analyses, which showed menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons to have more depolarized membrane potentials, lower firing thresholds, and higher evoked firing frequencies compared with menthol-insensitive Vglut3lineage neurons. A biophysical analysis revealed voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) currents in menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons were resistant to entry into slow inactivation compared with menthol-insensitive neurons. Multiplex in situ hybridization showed similar distributions of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive NaVs transcripts between TRPM8-positive and -negative Vglut3lineage neurons; however, NaV1.8 transcripts, which encode TTX-resistant channels, were more prevalent in TRPM8-negative neurons. Conversely, pharmacological analyses identified distinct functional contributions of NaV subunits, with NaV1.1 driving firing in menthol-sensitive neurons, whereas other small-diameter Vglut3lineage neurons rely primarily on TTX-resistant NaV channels. Additionally, when NaV1.1 channels were blocked, the remaining NaV currents readily entered into slow inactivation in menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage neurons. Thus, these data demonstrate that TTX-sensitive NaVs drive action potential firing in menthol-sensitive sensory neurons and contribute to their heightened excitability.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSomatosensensory neurons encode various sensory modalities including thermoreception, mechanoreception, nociception and itch. This report identifies a previously unknown requirement for tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels in action potential firing in a discrete subpopulation of small-diameter sensory neurons that are activated by the cooling agent menthol. Together, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of factors that control intrinsic excitability in functionally distinct subsets of peripheral neurons. Furthermore, as menthol has been used for centuries as an analgesic and anti-pruritic, these findings support the viability of NaV1.1 as a therapeutic target for sensory disorders.",

In adults, both challenges reduced the inhibitory drive from PV interneurons, as reported in neurodevelopmental disorders.

    "abstract": "Despite there is a growing interest in studying the presence and effects of microplastics (MP) in fishes and other aquatic species, knowledge is still limited in tropical areas. In this study, we examined the presence of MP in the gastrointestinal content of 30 filter feeders of thread herring, Opisthonema complex (Clupeiformes: Clupeidae) from the Central Pacific coast of Costa Rica. We detected the presence of MP in 100% of the individuals with an average of 36.7 pieces per fish, of which 79.5% were fibers and 20.5% particles. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Costa Rica that demonstrates the presence of MP in planktivorous fishes. The effects of microplastics ingestion by O. libertate and its transit through aquatic food webs should be studied in greater detail, with greater number of sampling points at different times of the year. However, our work confirms that contamination by microplastics is having direct effects on the marine life of Costa Rica.\\n\\nCapsuleThis is the first multidisciplinary study in Costa Rica demonstrating the presence and nature of microplastics in the digestive tract of planktivorous fish.",

    "abstract": "In Streptococcus mutans, the alternative sigma factor ComX controls entry into genetic competence. Competence signaling peptide (CSP) induces bimodal expression of comX, with only a fraction of cells in the population becoming transformable. Curiously, bimodal comX activation in response to CSP is affected by peptides in the growth medium and by carbohydrate source. CSP elicits bimodal expression of comX in media rich in small peptides, but in defined media lacking small peptides CSP induces no response in comX. In addition, growth on certain sugars other than glucose increases the proportion of the population that activates comX in response to CSP, relative to growth on glucose. By investigating the connection between media and bimodal comX expression, we find evidence for two mechanisms that modulate transcriptional positive feedback in the ComRS system, which is the origin of comX bimodality. We find that the endopeptidase PepO suppresses the ComRS feedback loop, most likely by degrading the intracellular XIP/ComS signal. Deletion of pepO eliminates bimodality in comX, leading to a unimodal comX response to CSP in defined and complex media. We also find that CSP upregulates comR in a carbohydrate source-dependent fashion, providing an additional stimulus to the ComRS feedback system. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how CSP regulates the bistable competence circuit and explain the puzzle of growth medium-dependence in S. mutans competence regulation.",

    "abstract": "GTPases are key-players in cellular signaling processes. Phosphorylation of Rab proteins, which belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases regulating intracellular transport, has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson Disease (PD). For Rab8a, it was shown that serine 111 phosphorylation (pS111) is dependent on the protein kinase PINK1, and that mimicking the phosphorylation at S111 by a serine/glutamate substitution (S111E) impaired Rab8a activation by its cognate nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rabin8. Here, we performed comparative Molecular Dynamics and free energy simulations on Rab8a and Rab8a:Rabin8 complexes to elucidate the molecular details on how pS111 and S111E may influence the interaction with Rabin8. The simulations indicate that S111E and pS111 establish an intramolecular interaction with arginine 79 (R79). In the complex, this interaction persists, and therefore perturbs a favorable intermolecular salt-bridge contact between R79 in Rab8a and the acidic aspartate 187 (D187) in Rabin8. Binding free analysis reveals that S111E and pS111, as well as the mutation R79A, in Rab8a drastically reduce the binding affinity to Rabin8. Combining the R79A mutation with S111E or pS111, respectively, nearly diminishes Rab8a-Rabin8 binding. In vitro experiments confirm our computational results showing that the nucleotide exchange rates of the respective Rab8a mutants are decreased by >80% in the presence of Rabin8 compared to wild type. In addition to specific insights into how S111 phosphorylation of Rab8a can influence GEF-mediated activation, the simulations demonstrate how side chain modifications in general can allosterically influence the network of surface side chain interactions between binding partners.",

    "abstract": "1Nucleotides comprise small molecules that perform critical signaling and energetic roles in biological systems. Of these, the concentrations of adenosine and its derivatives, including adenosine tri-, di-, and mono-phosphate are dynamically controlled in the extracellular-space by diphosphohydrolases and ecto-nucleotidases that rapidly degrade such nucleotides. In many instances, the close coupling between cells such as those in synaptic junctions yields tiny extracellular  nanodomains, within which the charged nucleotides interact with densely-packed membranes and biomolecules. While the contributions of electrostatic and steric interactions within such nanodomains are known to shape diffusion-limited reaction rates, less is understood about how these factors control the kinetics of sequentially-coupled diphosphohydrolase/nucleotidase-catalyzed reactions. To rank the relative importance of these factors, we utilize reaction-diffusion numerical simulations to systematically probe coupled enzyme activity in narrow junctions. We perform these simulations in nanoscale geometries representative of narrow extracellular compartments, within which we localize sequentially- and spatially-coupled enzymes. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of a representative charged substrate such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into substrates with different net charges, such as adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine (Ado). Our modeling approach considers electrostatic interactions of diffusing, charged substrates with extracellular membranes, and coupled enzymes. With this model, we find that 1) Reaction rates exhibited confinement effects, namely reduced reaction rates relative to bulk, that were most pronounced when the enzyme was close to the pore size and 2) The presence of charge on the pore boundary further tunes reaction rates by controlling the pooling of substrate near the reactive protein akin to ions near trans-membrane proteins. These findings suggest how remarkable reaction efficiencies of coupled enzymatic processes can be supported in charged and spatially-confined volumes of extracellular spaces.",

    "abstract": "Cells must alter their antioxidant capacity for maximal metastatic potential. However, the antioxidant adaptations required for transcoelomic metastasis, which is the passive dissemination of cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity as seen in ovarian cancer, have largely remained unexplored. Contradicting the need for oxidant scavenging by tumor cells is the observation that expression of the nutrient stress sensor and regulator of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, SIRT3, is suppressed in many primary tumors. We discovered that this mitochondrial deacetylase is however, upregulated in a context-dependent manner in cancer cells. SIRT3 activity and expression transiently increased following ovarian cancer cell detachment and in tumor cells derived from malignant ascites of high-grade serous adenocarcinoma patients. Mechanistically, SIRT3 prevents mitochondrial superoxide surges in detached cells by regulating the manganese superoxide dismutase SOD2. This mitochondrial stress response is under dual regulation by SIRT3. SIRT3 rapidly increases SOD2 activity as an early adaptation to cellular detachment, which is followed by SIRT3-dependent transcriptional increases in SOD2 during sustained anchorage-independence. In addition, SIRT3 inhibits glycolytic capacity in anchorage-independent cells thereby contributing to metabolic changes in response to detachment. While manipulation of SIRT3 expression has few deleterious effects on cancer cells in attached conditions, SIRT3 up-regulation and SIRT3-mediated oxidant scavenging following matrix detachment are required for anoikis resistance in vitro, and both SIRT3 and SOD2 are necessary for colonization of the peritoneal cavity in vivo. Our results highlight the novel context-specific, pro-metastatic role of SIRT3 in ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of signaling hierarchies and their spatiotemporal organization together, contribute to diverse signaling outcomes. This is evident in the Notch pathway, which regulates an array of cellular processes, despite a small number of core components. Here, we describe a Notch4 activated signaling cascade, dependent on the nucleolar localization of the Notch4 Intracellular Domain (NIC4), that protects cells from genotoxic damage. Localization was assessed by immune-staining for endogenous Notch4 and visualization by confocal microscopy, in breast cancer cell lines. Live-cell, imaging-based, biophysical analysis of NIC4-GFP expressing cells, indicated unhindered mobility between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm and a stable nucleolar pool of NIC4-GFP. RNAi-mediated ablations, coupled with analysis of recombinant forms of NIC4 with modifications of its nucleolar localization sequence, confirmed nucleolar localization and identified the nucleolar proteins, Nucleolin and Fibrillarin, as key intermediates in the NIC4-activated signaling cascade. The transcriptional control of ribosome biogenesis (47s and 45s pre-rRNA transcription), emerged as another unexpected consequence of the subcellular distribution of NIC4. Taken together, this study describes intrinsic features of NIC4 that confer spatial flexibility and expand the repertoire of Notch4 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Mouse Apolipoprotein L9 is a 34-kDa phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein. The gene is present only in mouse and rat genomes; hence it is taxonomically restricted. To understand why, it is essential to uncover details about its functions in cellular processes. Here we show that ApoL9 interacts with the proteins of the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies, which are key players in macroautophagy. In amino-acid starved cells it preferentially interacts with lipidated LC3B, likely by binding to its PE moiety. On treatment with autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, ApoL9 is found near swollen mitochondria and on lysosomes/LAMP1-positive compartments. However, ApoL9 itself does not seem to be degraded as a result of autophagy, suggesting that it is not an autophagy cargo receptor. Deletions in a putative transmembrane region between amino acids 110 and 145 abolish PE-binding. In addition, ApoL9 can redistribute to stress granules, can homooligomerize, and is a microtubule-associated protein. In short, its distribution in the cell is quite widespread, suggesting that it could have functions at the intersection of membrane binding and reorganization, autophagy, cellular stress and intracellular lipid transport.\\n\\nSummary statementThis article is about how Apolipoprotein L9, a lipid-binding protein, has versatile properties and influences a variety of processes taking place inside an animal cell.",

We recruited children with active trachoma and adults with conjunctival scarring, alongside corresponding matched controls.\\n\\nFindingsIn children, active trachoma was not associated with significant changes in the ocular microbiome. Haemophilus enrichment was associated with antimicrobial responses but not linked to active trachoma. Adults with scarring trachoma had a reduced ocular bacterial diversity compared to controls, with increased relative abundance of Corynebacterium. Increased abundance of Corynebacterium in scarring disease was associated with innate immune responses to the microbiota, dominated by altered mucin expression and increased matrix adhesion.\\n\\nInterpretationIn the absence of current C. trachomatis infection, changes in the ocular microbiome associate with antimicrobial and inflammatory responses that impair epithelial cell health. In scarring trachoma, expansion of  non-pathogenic bacteria such as Corynebacterium and innate responses are coincident, warranting further investigation of this relationship. Comparisons between active and scarring trachoma supported the relative absence of type-1 interferon responses in scarring, whilst highlighting a common suppression of re-epithelialisation with altered epithelial and bacterial adhesion, likely contributing to development of scarring pathology.",

    "abstract": "Based on recent in vitro data, a relatively large number of the plant Nitrate transporter 1/Peptide transporter Family (NPF) proteins has been suggested to function as gibberellic acid (GA) transporters. Most GA transporting NPF proteins also appear to transport other structurally unrelated phytohormones or metabolites. Several of the GAs used in previous in vitro assays are membrane permeable weak organic acids whose movement across membranes are influenced by the pH-sensitive ion-trap mechanism. Moreover, a large proportion of in vitro GA transport activities have been demonstrated indirectly via long-term yeast-based GA-dependent growth assays that are limited to detecting transport of bioactive GAs. Thus, there is a need for an optimized transport assay for identifying and characterizing GA transport. Here, we develop an improved transport assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes wherein we directly measure movement of six different GAs across oocyte membranes over short time. We show that membrane permeability of GAs in oocytes can be predicted based on number of oxygen atoms and that several GAs do not diffuse over membranes regardless of changes in pH values. In addition, we show that small changes in internal cellular pH can result in strongly altered distribution of membrane permeable phytohormones. This prompts caution when interpreting heterologous transport activities. We use our transport assay to screen all Arabidopsis thaliana NPF proteins for transport activity towards six GAs (two membrane permeable and four non-permeable). The results presented here, significantly reduce the number of bona fide NPF GA transporters in Arabidopsis and narrow the activity to fewer subclades within the family. Furthermore, to gain first insight into the molecular determinants of substrate specificities towards organic molecules transported in the NPF, we charted all surface exposed amino acid residues in the substrate-binding cavity and correlated them to GA transport. This analysis identified distinct residues within the substrate-binding cavity that are shared between GA transporting NPF proteins; the potential roles of these residues in determining substrate specificity are discussed.",

Although most biochemical details of the WLP are well understood and systems-level characterisation of acetogen metabolism has recently improved, key transcriptional features such as promoter motifs and transcriptional regulators are still unknown in acetogens. Here, we use differential RNA-sequencing to identify a previously undescribed promoter motif associated with essential genes for autotrophic growth of the model-acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum. RNA polymerase was shown to bind to the new promoter motif using a DNA-binding protein assay and proteomics enabled the discovery of four candidates to potentially function directly in control of transcription of the WLP and other key genes of C1 fixation metabolism. Next, in vivo experiments showed that a TetR-family transcriptional regulator (CAETHG_0459) and the housekeeping sigma factor ({sigma}A) activate expression of a reporter protein (GFP) in-frame with the new promoter motif from a fusion vector in E. coli. Lastly, a protein-protein interaction assay with the RNA polymerase (RNAP) shows that CAETHG_0459 directly binds to the RNAP.

Using a novel approach based on the combined use of SEM and photogrammetry, we quantified the ovipositor size and 3D shape, contrasting invasive and native populations raised at three different developmental temperatures. We found a small but significant effect of temperature and geographic origin on the ovipositor shape, showing the occurrence of both geographic differentiation and plasticity to temperature. The shape reaction norms are in turn strikingly similar among populations, suggesting very little difference in shape plasticity among invasive and native populations, and therefore rejecting the hypothesis of a particular role for plasticity of the ovipositor in the invasion success. Overall, the ovipositor shape seems to be a fairly robust trait, indicative of stabilizing selection. The large performance spectrum rather than the flexibility of the ovipositor would thus contribute to the success of D. suzukii worldwide invasion.",

    "abstract": "Nitrification is a common concern in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems. The addition of ammonia promotes the growth of nitrifying organisms, causing the depletion of chloramine residuals and resulting in operational problems for many drinking water utilities. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the microbially mediated processes behind nitrogen metabolism together with chemical water quality data, may allow water utilities to better address the undesirable effects caused by nitrification. In this study, a metagenomic approach was applied to characterise the microbial nitrogen metabolism within chloraminated drinking water reservoirs. Samples from two geographically separated but connected chloraminated reservoirs within the same drinking water distribution system (DWDS) were collected within a 2-year sampling campaign. Spatial changes in the nitrogen compounds (ammonium (NH4+), nitrites (NO2-) and nitrates (NO3-)) across the DWDS were observed, where nitrate concentrations increased as the distance from the site of chloramination increased. The observed dominance of Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira-like bacteria, together with the changes in the concentration of nitrogen species, suggests that these bacteria play a significant role in contributing to varying stages of nitrification in both reservoirs. Functionally annotated protein sequences were mined for the genes associated with nitrogen metabolism and the community gene catalogue contained mostly genes involved in nitrification, nitrate and nitrite reduction and nitric oxide reduction. Furthermore, based on the construction of Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), a highly diverse assemblage of bacteria (i.e., predominately Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria in this study) was observed among the draft genomes. Specifically, 5 MAGs showed high coverage across all samples including two Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, Sphingomonas and a Rhizobiales-like MAGs. The role of these MAGs in nitrogen metabolism revealed that the fate nitrate may be linked to changes in ammonia concentrations, that is, when ammonia concentrations are low, nitrate may be assimilated back to ammonia for growth. Alternatively, nitrate may be reduced to nitric oxide and potentially used in the regulation of biofilm formation. Therefore, this study provides insight into the genetic network behind microbially mediated nitrogen metabolism and together with the water chemistry data improves our understanding nitrification in chloraminated DWDSs.",

We analyzed m6A modification across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, we found that activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by viral infection contributes to the changes in m6A modification in RIOK3 and CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.",

    "abstract": "Newly acquired memory traces are spontaneously reactivated during slow-wave sleep (SWS), leading to the consolidation of recent memories. Empirical studies found that sensory stimulation during SWS selectively enhances memory consolidation and the effect depends on the phase of stimulation. In this new study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the role of sensory stimulation on memory consolidation using computational models implementing effects of neuromodulators to simulate transitions between awake and SWS sleep, and synaptic plasticity to allow the change of synaptic connections due to the training in awake or replay during sleep. We found that when closed-loop stimulation was applied during the Down states (900-2700) of sleep slow oscillation, particularly right before transition from Down to Up state, it significantly affected the spatio-temporal pattern of the slow-waves and maximized memory replay. In contrast, when the stimulation was presented during the Up states (2700-3600 and 00-900), it did not have a significant impact on the slow-waves or memory performance after sleep. For multiple memories trained in awake, presenting stimulation cues associated with specific memory trace could selectively augment replay and enhance consolidation of that memory and interfere with consolidation of the others (particularly weak) memories. Our study proposes a synaptic level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.\\n\\nSignificance statementStimulation, such as training-associated cues or auditory stimulation, during sleep can augment consolidation of the newly encoded memories. In this study, we used a computational model of the thalamocortical system to describe the mechanisms behind the role of stimulation in memory consolidation during slow-wave sleep. Our study suggested that stimulation preferentially strengthens the memory traces when delivered at specific phase of slow oscillations just before Down to Up state transition when it makes the largest impact on the spatio-temporal pattern of sleep slow waves. In the presence of multiple memories, presenting sensory cues during sleep could selectively strengthen selected memories. Our study proposes a synaptic level mechanism of how memory consolidation is affected by sensory stimulation during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based modelling (CBM) is a powerful tool for the analysis of evolutionary trajectories. Evolution, especially evolution in the distant past, is not easily accessible to laboratory experimentation. Modelling can provide a window into evolutionary processes by allowing the examination of selective pressures which lead to particular optimal solutions in the model. To study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a ground state of C3 photosynthesis, we initially construct a C3 model. After duplication into two cells to reflect typical C4 leaf architecture, we allow the model to predict the optimal metabolic solution under various conditions. The model thus identifies resource limitation in conjunction with high photorespiratory flux as a selective pressure relevant to the evolution of C4. It also predicts that light availability and distribution play a role in guiding the evolutionary choice of possible decarboxylation enzymes. The data shows evolutionary CBM in eukaryotes predicts molecular evolution with precision.",

    "abstract": "Coenzyme F420 is a specialized redox cofactor with a highly negative redox potential. It supports biochemical processes like methanogenesis, degradation of xenobiotics or the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Although well-studied in methanogenic archaea and actinobacteria, not much is known about F420 in Gram-negative bacteria. Genome sequencing revealed F420 biosynthetic genes in the Gram-negative, endofungal bacterium Paraburkholderia rhizoxinica, a symbiont of phytopathogenic fungi. Fluorescence microscopy, high-resolution LC-MS, and structure elucidation by NMR demonstrated that the encoded pathway is active and yields unexpected derivatives of F420 (3PG-F420). Further analyses of a biogas-producing microbial community showed that these derivatives are more widespread in nature. Genetic and biochemical studies of their biosynthesis established that a specificity switch in the guanylyltransferase CofC re-programmed the pathway to start from 3-phospho-D-glycerate, suggesting a rerouting event during the evolution of F420 biosynthesis. Furthermore, the cofactor activity of 3PG-F420 was validated, thus opening up perspectives for its use in biocatalysis. The 3PG-F420 biosynthetic gene cluster is fully functional in Escherichia coli, enabling convenient production of the cofactor by fermentation.",

A method is needed to utlize a set of temporally local controls that maximises analytic power while minimising noise from unspecified environmental factors.\\n\\nResultsHere we introduce \\\"soft windowing\\\", a methodological approach that selects a window of time that includes the most appropriate controls for analysis. Using phenotype data from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), adaptive windows were applied such that control data collected proximally to mutants were assigned the maximal weight, while data collected earlier or later had less weight. We applied this method to IMPC data and compared the results with those obtained from a standard non-windowed approach. Validation was performed using a resampling approach in which we demonstrate a 10% reduction of false positives from 2.5 million analyses. We applied the method to our production analysis pipeline that establishes genotype-phenotype associations by comparing mutant versus control data. We report an increase of 30% in significant p-values, as well as linkage to 106 versus 99 disease models via phenotype overlap with the soft windowed and non-windowed approaches, respectively, from a set of 2,082 mutant mouse lines.

When fetal movements are reduced or restricted, infants are at higher risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip and arthrogryposis (multiple joint contractures). Joint shape abnormalities have been reported in mouse models with abnormal or absent musculature, but the effects on joint shape in such models have not been quantified or characterised in detail. In this study, embryonic mouse forelimbs and hindlimbs at a single developmental stage (Theiler Stage 23) with normal, reduced or absent muscle were imaged in 3D. Skeletal rudiments were virtually segmented and rigid image registration was used to reliably align rudiments with each other, enabling repeatable assessment and measurement of joint shape differences between normal, reduced-muscle and absent muscle groups. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that joint shapes are differentially affected by a lack of, or reduction in, skeletal muscle, with the elbow joint being the most affected of the major limb joints. Surprisingly, the effects of reduced muscle were often more pronounced than those of absent skeletal muscle, indicating a complex relationship between muscle mass and joint morphogenesis. These findings have relevance for human developmental disorders of the skeleton in which abnormal fetal movements are implicated, particularly developmental dysplasia of the hip and arthrogryposis.",

    "abstract": "Infection can dramatically alter behavioural and physiological traits as hosts become sick and subsequently return to health. Such \\\"sickness behaviours\\\" include disrupted circadian rhythms in both locomotor activity and body temperature. Host sickness behaviours vary in pathogen species-specific manners but the influence of pathogen intraspecific variation is rarely studied. We examine how infection with the murine malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, shapes sickness in terms of parasite genotype-specific effects on host circadian rhythms. We reveal that circadian rhythms in host locomotor activity patterns and body temperature become differentially disrupted and in parasite genotype-specific manners. Locomotor activity and body temperature in combination provide more sensitive measures of health than commonly used virulence metrics for malaria (e.g. anaemia). Moreover, patterns of host disruption cannot be explained simply by variation in replication rate across parasite genotypes or the severity of anaemia each parasite genotype causes. It is well known that disruption to circadian rhythms is associated with non-infectious diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Our results reveal that disruption of host circadian rhythms is a genetically variable virulence trait of pathogens with implications for host health and disease tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Phage-like elements are found in a multitude of streptococcal species, including pneumococcal strain Hungary19A-6 (SpnCI). The aim of our research was to investigate the role of phage-like element SpnCI in enhanced virulence and phenotypic modulation within Streptococcus pneumoniae. SpnCI was found to significantly enhance virulence within the invertebrate infection model Galleria mellonella. Infections with SpnCI led to a lower mean health score (1.6) and survival percentage (20%) compared to SpnCI null TIGR4 infections (3.85 mean health score and 50% survival). SpnCI remained integrated throughout growth, conferring greater sensitivity to UV irradiation. Change in transcriptional patterns occurred, including downregulation of operons involved with cell surface modelling in the SpnCI containing strain of TIGR4. Kanamycin-tagged SpnCI strain in Hungary19A-6 was inducible and isolated from lysate along with both annotated prophages. No phages were identified by PCR nor electron microscopy (EM) following induction of TIGR4 SpnCI{Delta}strA suggesting helper-phage dependence for dissemination. EM of lysate showed typical siphoviridae morphology with an average capsid size of 60 nm. Two of sixty capsids were found to be smaller, suggesting SpnCI disseminates using a similar mechanism described for Staphylococcus aureus phage-like element SaPI. SpnCI from lysate infected capsule null strain T4R but was incapable of infecting the encapsulated TIGR4 strain suggesting that capsule impedes phage infection. Our work demonstrates that SpnCI can modulate virulence, UV susceptibility, alter transcriptional patterns, and furthermore, can disseminate via infection within pneumococcus. Further research is necessary to elucidate how SpnCI modulates virulence and what genes are responsible for the enhanced virulence phenotype.\\n\\nImportanceAlthough vaccines have limited the scope of pneumococcal infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae still remains an important human pathogen. Understanding novel elements, such as SpnCI, that enhance virulence can lead to the development of more targeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools within the clinical realm.",

Significant variations and dynamics were evidenced for the formation, utilization and stoichiometry of intracellular polymers, namely polyphosphate, glycogen and Polyhydroxyalkanoates in PAOs and GAOs in the EBPR systems that were operated with influent C/P ranged from 20 to 50, presumably as results of phylogenetic diversity changes and, or metabolic functions shifts in these two populations at different influent C/P ratios. Single cell Raman micro-spectroscopy enabled quantification of differentiated polymer inclusion levels in PAOs and GAOs and, showed that as the influent rbCOD/P ratio increases, the excessive carbon beyond stoichiometric requirement for PAOs would be diverted into GAOs. Our results also evidenced that when condition becomes more P limiting at higher rbCOD/P ratios, both energy and reducing power generation required for acetate uptake and PHB formation might shift from relying on both polyP hydrolysis and glycolysis pathway, to more enhancement and dependence on glycolysis in addition to partial/reverse TCA cycle. These findings provided new insights into the metabolic elasticity of PAOs and GAOs and their population-level parameters for mechanistic EBPR modeling. This study also demonstrated the potential of application of single cell Raman micro-spectroscopy method as a powerful tool for studying phenotypic dynamics in ecological systems such as EBPR.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=97 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/671081v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (37K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13227d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d52d42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e67c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13eb1aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mutations in SMCHD1 can also cause facioscapulohumoral muscular dystrophy. More recently, SMCHD1 has also been detected as component of telomeric chromatin. Here, we identify requirements of SMCHD1 for DNA damage signaling and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at unprotected telomeres. Co-depletion of SMCHD1 with TRF2 reduced the rate of 3 overhang removal in time course experiments and the number of telomere end fusions. In SMCHD1 deficient cells, the formation of ATM pS1981, {gamma}H2AX and 53BP1 containing telomere dysfunction induced foci (TIFs) were diminished indicating defects in checkpoint signaling. Strikingly, removal of TPP1 and subsequent activation of ATR signaling rescued telomere fusion events in TRF2-depleted SMCHD1 knockout cells. Together, these data indicate that SMCHD1 depletion reduces telomere fusions in TRF2-depleted cells due to defects in ATM-dependent DNA checkpoint signaling.

    "abstract": "The mammalian pocket protein family, which includes the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Rb-like pocket proteins p107 and p130, regulates entry into and exit from the cell cycle by repressing cell cycle gene expression. Although pRb plays a dominant role in mammalian systems, p107 and p130 are the ancestral pocket proteins. The Rb-like pocket proteins interact with the highly conserved 5-subunit MuvB complex and an E2F-DP transcription factor heterodimer, forming the DREAM (for Dp, Rb-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex. DREAM complex assembly on chromatin culminates in repression of target genes mediated by the MuvB subcomplex. Here, we examined how the Rb-like pocket protein contributes to DREAM formation and function by disrupting the interaction between the sole Caenorhabditis elegans pocket protein LIN-35 and the MuvB subunit LIN-52 using CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis. A triple alanine substitution of LIN-52s LxCxE motif severed LIN-35-MuvB association and caused classical DREAM mutant phenotypes, including synthetic multiple vulvae, high-temperature arrest, and ectopic expression of germline genes in the soma. However, RNA-seq revealed limited upregulation of DREAM target genes when LIN-35-MuvB association was severed, as compared to gene upregulation following LIN-35 loss. Based on chromatin immunoprecipitation, disrupting LIN-35-MuvB association did not affect the chromatin localization of E2F-DP, LIN-35, or MuvB components. In a previous study we showed that in worms lacking LIN-35, E2F-DP and MuvB chromatin occupancy was reduced genome-wide. With LIN-35 present but unable to associate with MuvB, our present study suggests that the E2F-DP-LIN-35 interaction promotes E2F-DPs chromatin localization, which we hypothesize supports MuvB chromatin occupancy indirectly through DNA. Altogether, this study highlights how the pocket proteins association with MuvB supports DREAM function but is not required for DREAMs chromatin occupancy.",

    "abstract": "Bifunctional Rel stringent factors, the most broadly distributed class of RSHs, are ribosome-associated enzymes that transfer a pyrophosphate group from ATP onto the 3' of GTP or GDP to synthesize (p)ppGpp and also catalyse the 3' pyrophosphate hydrolysis of the alarmone to degrade it. The precise regulation of these enzymes seems to be a complex allosteric mechanism, and despite decades of research, it is unclear how the two opposing activities of Rel are controlled at the molecular level. Here we show that a stretch/recoil guanosine-switch mechanism controls the catalytic cycle of T. thermophilus Rel (RelTf). The binding of GDP/ATP stretches apart the NTD catalytic domains of RelTf (RelTtNTD) activating the synthetase domain and allosterically blocking the hydrolase active site. Conversely, binding of ppGpp unlocks the hydrolase domain and triggers recoil of both NTDs, which partially buries the synthetase active site and precludes the binding of synthesis precursors. This allosteric mechanism acts as an activity switch preventing futile cycles of alarmone synthesis and degradation.",

    "abstract": "The vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) plays an important role in social behaviors including aggression, social learning and memory. Genetic removal of Avpr1b from mouse models results in deficits in aggression and short-term social recognition in adults. Avpr1b gene expression is highly enriched in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 2 (CA2) region. Activity of the hippocampal CA2 has been shown to be required for normal short-term social recognition and aggressive behaviors. Vasopressin acts to enhance synaptic responses of CA2 neurons through a NMDA-receptor dependent mechanism. Genetic removal of the obligatory subunit of the NMDA receptor (Grin1) within distinct hippocampal regions impairs non-social learning and memory. However, the question of a direct role for NMDA receptor activity in Avpr1b neurons to modulate social behavior remains unclear. To answer this question, we first created a novel transgenic mouse line with Cre recombinase knocked into the Avpr1b coding region to genetically target Avpr1b neurons. We confirmed this line has dense Cre expression throughout the dorsal and ventral CA2 regions of the hippocampus, along with scattered expression within the caudate-putamen and olfactory bulb. Conditional removal of the NMDA receptor was achieved by crossing our line to an available floxed Grin1 line. The resulting mice were measured on a battery of social and memory behavioral tests. Surprisingly, we did not observe any differences between Avpr1b-Grin1 knockout mice and their wildtype siblings. We conclude that mice without typical NMDA receptor function in Avpr1b neurons can develop normal aggression as well as short-term social and object memory performance.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActivity of neurons that express vasopressin 1b receptor are essential for aggressive and social recognition behaviors. We created a novel transgenic mouse to allow selective targeting of vasopressin 1b neurons. Our studies indicate that NMDA receptor expression in vasopressin 1b neurons (including most CA2 neurons) are not required for development of the typical expression of aggression or recognition memory. Thus, CA2 neurons may have a unique way of incorporating novel stimuli into memory that deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced DPP-IV expression is found to get enhanced in various intestinal diseases. PTY-2 has already been known to have DPP-IV inhibitory potential. This inhibition has not yet been studied at mRNA level. Increased incretin secretion due to DPP-IV inhibition could lead to suppression of stress & intestinal cells apoptosis. Through histological analysis, we have found morphological damage of intestine after STZ injection (65 mg/kg bw) to male Charles foster rats. mRNA expressions were analyzed by PCR and apoptosis of cells was checked through tunnel assay & Bcl 2 expression. The number and length of villi get reduced in STZ induced diabetic control, but these damages have been getting reversed after the PTY-2 treatment for 10 days. The expression of SOD was found to get reduced while that of DPP-IV was enhanced in diabetic control group along with significant intestinal cell apoptosis. PTY-2 treatment reduces the stress by upregulating the expression of SOD and through downregulation of DPP-IV mRNA expression. These recoveries by PTY-2 leads to suppression of intestinal cells apoptosis. These short studies explain the protective action of PTY-2 against STZ induced intestinal damage. Hence, PTY-2 could be taken as an herbal treatment against intestinal disorders in case of chronic diabetes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular profiling has become essential for tumor risk stratification and treatment selection. However, cancer genome complexity and technical artifacts make identification of real variants a challenge. Currently, clinical laboratories rely on manual screening, which is costly, subjective, and not scalable. Here we present a machine learning-based method to distinguish artifacts from bona fide Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) detected by NGS from tumor specimens.\\n\\nMethodsA cohort of 11,278 SNVs identified through clinical sequencing of tumor specimens were collected and divided into training, validation, and test sets. Each SNV was manually inspected and labeled as either real or artifact as part of clinical laboratory workflow. A three-class (real, artifact and uncertain) model was developed on the training set, fine-tuned using the validation set, and then evaluated on the test set. Prediction intervals reflecting the certainty of the classifications were derived during the process to label \\\"uncertain\\\" variants.\\n\\nResultsThe optimized classifier demonstrated 100% specificity and 97% sensitivity over 5,587 SNVs of the test set. 1,252 out of 1,341 true positive variants were identified as real, 4,143 out of 4,246 false positive calls were deemed artifacts, while only 192(3.4%) SNVs were labeled as \\\"uncertain\\\" with zero misclassification between the true positives and artifacts in the test set.\\n\\nConclusionsWe presented a computational classifier to identify variant artifacts detected from tumor sequencing. Overall, 96.6% of the SNVs received a definitive label and thus were exempt from manual review. This framework could improve quality and efficiency of variant review process in clinical labs.",

Diagnostic delay contributes to the poor outcome. There is an urgent need for new tools for the rapid diagnosis of TBM, especially in children.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected serum samples from children in whom TBM was suspected at a tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Children were subsequently classified as having TBM or no TBM using a published uniform research case-definition. Using a multiplex cytokine array platform, we investigated the concentrations of serum biomarkers comprising 7-markers that were previously found to be of value in the diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB (CRP, SAA, CFH, IFN-{gamma}, IP-10, Apo-AI and transthyretin) plus other potentially useful host biomarkers as diagnostic candidates for TBM.\\n\\nFindingsOf 47 children included in the study, 23 (48.9%) had a final diagnosis of TBM of which six had HIV co-infection. A modified version of the adult 7-marker biosignature in which transthyretin was replaced by NCAM1, diagnosed TBM in children with AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92), sensitivity of 73.9% (95% CI, 51.6-89.8%) and specificity of 66.7% (95% CI, 44.7-84.4%). A new childhood TBM specific 3-marker biosignature (adipsin, A{beta}42 and IL-10) showed potential in the diagnosis of TBM, with AUC of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96), sensitivity of 82.6% (95 CI, 61.2-95.0%) and specificity of 75.0% (95% CI, 53.3-90.2%) after leave-one-out cross validation.\\n\\nConclusionAn adult 7-marker serum protein biosignature showed potential in the diagnosis of TBM in children. However, a smaller childhood TBM-specific biosignature demonstrated improved performance characteristics.

In the Provence region of France, wild boars are very abundant, and the current study was carried out to assess the presence of tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria in feces of wild boar population. W e developed an original protocol allowing the fast isolation of mycobacteria by combining a 1%-chlorhexidine decontamination of fecal matter with culture on MOD9 medium. Colonies were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, combined with DNA sequencing. This protocol yielded no tuberculous mycobacteria among ninety-nine wild boar fecal samples collected in the Provence region. However, non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from five samples (5.05%), including Mycobacterium peregrinum, Mycobacterium vaccae and Mycobacterium setense, the last species being previously unreported in the wild boar; in addition to two positive samples for Nocardia spp. In conclusion, wild boars in southeastern France are not shedding tuberculosis agents, but they could constitute a reservoir of human non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis in selected populations directly exposed to wild boars.",

We produced a new set of analyses for the last decade, using an extensive data of more than 45,000 projects between 1990 and 2017, and report a recent upsurge of R&D productivity within the industry. First, we investigated how R&D projects are allocated across therapeutic areas and found a polarization towards high-risk/high-reward indications, with a strong focus on oncology. Importantly, attrition rates have been decreasing at all clinical stages in recent years. In parallel, we observed an increase of early failures in preclinical research, and a significant reduction of time required to identify projects to be discontinued. Notably, more recent projects are increasingly based on novel mechanisms of action and target indications with small patient populations. Finally, by analyses of the relative contribution of different institutional types and development companies, we show that the observed increased performance in clinical trials is mostly due to the contribution of biotech-nological companies, while pharmaceutical companies have significantly improved their performances in identifying false positives in preclinical research.",

    "abstract": "Presence of quiescent, therapy evasive population often described as cancer stem cells (CSC) or tumor initiating cells (TIC) is often attributed to extreme metastasis and tumor recurrence. This population is typically enriched in a tumor as a result of microenvironment or chemotherapy induced stress. The TIC population adapts to this stress by turning on cell cycle arrest programs that is a \\\"fail-safe\\\" mechanism to prevent expansion of malignant cells to prevent further injury. Upon removal of the \\\"stress\\\" conditions, these cells restart their cell cycle and regain their proliferative nature thereby resulting in tumor relapse. Growth Arrest Specific 5 (GAS5) is a long-noncoding RNA that plays a vital role in this process. In pancreatic cancer, CD133+ population is a typical representation of the TIC population that is responsible for tumor relapse. In this study, we show for the first time that emergence of CD133+ population coincides with upregulation of GAS5, that reprograms the cell cycle to slow proliferation by inhibiting GR mediated cell cycle control. The CD133+ population further routed metabolites like glucose to shunt pathways like pentose phosphate pathway, that were predominantly biosynthetic in spite of being quiescent in nature but did not use it immediately for nucleic acid synthesis. Upon inhibiting GAS5, these cells were released from their growth arrest and restarted the nucleic acid synthesis and proliferation. Our study thus showed that GAS5 acts as a molecular switch for regulating quiescence and growth arrest in CD133+ population, that is responsible for aggressive biology of pancreatic tumors.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase II (Top2) removes topological linkages between replicated chromosomes. Top2 inhibition leads to mitotic catastrophe (MC) when cells unsuccessfully try to split their genetic material between the two daughter cells. Herein, we have characterized the fate of these daughter cells in the budding yeast. Clonogenic and microcolony experiments, in combination with vital and apoptotic stains, showed that 75% of daughter cells become senescent in the short term; they are unable to divide but remain alive. Decline in cell vitality then occurred, yet slowly, uncoordinatedly when comparing pairs of daughters, and independently of the cell death mediator Mca1/Yca1. Furthermore, we showed that senescence can be modulated by ploidy, suggesting that gross chromosome imbalances during segregation may account for this phenotype. Indeed, we found that diploid long-term survivors of the MC are prone to genomic imbalances such as trisomies, uniparental disomies and terminal loss of heterozygosity (LOH), the latter affecting the longest chromosome arms.",

    "abstract": "Organisms - especially microbes - tend to live in complex communities. While some of these ecosystems are very bio-diverse, others arent1-3, and while some are very stable over time others undergo strong temporal fluctuations4,5. Despite a long history of research and a plethora of data it is not fully understood what sets biodiversity and stability of ecosystems6,7. Theory as well as experiments suggest a connection between species interaction, biodiversity, and stability of ecosystems8-13, where an increase of ecosystem stability with biodiversity could be observed in several cases7,9,14. However, what causes these connections remains unclear. Here we show in microbial ecosystems in the lab that the concentrations of available nutrients can set the strength of interactions between bacteria. At high nutrient concentrations, extensive microbial growth leads to strong chemical modifications of the environment, causing more negative interactions between species. These stronger interactions exclude more species from the community - resulting in a loss of biodiversity. At the same time, these stronger interactions also decrease the stability of the microbial communities, providing a mechanistic link between species interaction, biodiversity and stability.",

    "abstract": "F1 hybrids between mouse inbred strains PWD and C57BL/6 represent the most thoroughly genetically defined model of hybrid sterility in vertebrates. Hybrid male sterility can be fully reconstituted from three components of this model, namely the Prdm9 hybrid sterility gene, intersubspecific homeology of Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus autosomes, and the X-linked Hstx2 locus. Hstx2 modulates the extent of Prdm9-dependent meiotic arrest and harbors two additional genetic factors responsible for intersubspecific introgression-induced oligospermia (Hstx1) and reduced global meiotic recombination rate (Meir1). To facilitate positional cloning and to overcome the recombination suppression within the 4.3 Mb genomicDob interval encompassing the Hstx2 locus we designed Hstx2-CRISPR and SPO11/Cas9 transgenes aimed to induce DNA double-strand breaks specifically within the Hstx2 locus. The resulting recombinant reduced the Hstx2 locus to 2.70 Mb (Chr X:66.51-69.21 Mb). The newly defined Hstx2 still operates as the major X-linked factor of the F1 hybrid sterility, controls meiotic chromosome synapsis, and modifies meiotic recombination rate. Despite extensive further crosses, the 2.70 Mb Hstx2 interval behaved as a recombination cold spot with reduced PRDM9-mediated H3K4 hotspots and absence of DMC1-defined DNA DSB hotspots. To search for structural anomalies as a possible cause of recombination suppression we used optical mapping of the Hstx2 interval and observed high incidence of subspecies-specific structural variants along the X chromosome, with a striking copy number polymorphism of the microRNA Mir465 cluster. Finally, we analyzed the role of one of the Hstx2 candidate genes, the Fmr1 neighbor (Fmr1nb) gene in male fertility.\\n\\nArticle summaryEarly meiotic arrest of mouse intersubspecific hybrids depends on the interaction between the Prdm9 gene and Hybrid sterility X2 (Hstx2) locus on chromosome X. Lustyk et al. conducted high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of the Hstx2 locus, reduced it to 2.7 Mb interval within a constitutive recombination cold spot and found that the newly defined Hstx2 still operates as the X-linked hybrid sterility factor, controls meiotic chromosome synapsis, and modifies recombination rate. Optical mapping of the Hstx2 genomic region excluded inversion as a cause of recombination suppression and revealed a striking copy number polymorphism of the microRNA Mir465 cluster.",

    "abstract": "Obesity, a risk factor for various human diseases originates through complex interactions between genes and prevailing environment that varies across populations. Indians exhibit a unique obesity phenotype likely attributed by specific gene pool and environmental factors. Here, we present genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 7,259 Indians to understand the genetic architecture of body mass index (BMI) in the population. Our study revealed novel association of variants in BAI3 (rs6913677) and SLC22A11 (rs2078267) at GWAS significance, and of ZNF45 (rs8100011) with near GWAS significance. As genetic loci may dictate the phenotype through modulation of epigenetic processes, we overlapped discovered genetic signatures with DNA methylation patterns of 236 Indian individuals, and analyzed expression of the candidate genes using publicly available data. The variants in BAI3 and SLC22A11 were found to dictate methylation patterns at unique CpGs harboring critical cis- regulatory elements. Further, BAI3, SLC22A11 and ZNF45 variants were found to overlie repressive chromatin, active enhancer, and active chromatin regions, in that order, in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in ENCODE database. Besides, the identified genomic regions represented potential binding sites for key transcription factors implicated in obesity and/or metabolic disorders. Interestingly, rs8100011 (ZNF45) acted as a robust cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) in subcutaneous adipose tissue in GTEx portal, and ZNF45 gene expression showed an inverse correlation with BMI in skeletal muscle of Indian subjects. Further, gene-based GWAS analysis revealed CPS1 and UPP2 as additional leads regulating BMI in Indians. Our study decodes potential genomic mechanisms underlying obesity phenotype in Indians.",

We identified a HIV-1-seropositive woman who spontaneously suppressed HIV replication and had normal CD4-cell counts, no HIV disease, no replication-competent virus and no cell HIV DNA detected with a routine assay. We suspected that dramatic HIV DNA degradation occurred postinfection. We performed multiple nested-PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing and applied a multiplex-PCR approach. Furthermore, we implemented a new technique based on two hybridization steps on beads prior to next-generation sequencing that removed human DNA then retrieved integrated HIV sequences with HIV-specific probes. We assembled {approx}45% of the HIV genome and further analyzed the G-to-A mutations putatively generated by cellular APOBEC3 enzymes that can change tryptophan codons into stop codons. We found more G-to-A mutations in the HIV DNA from the woman than in that of her contaminator. Moreover, 74% of the tryptophan codons were changed to stop codons (25%) or were deleted as a possible consequence of gene inactivation. Finally, we found that this womans cells remained HIV-susceptible in vitro.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe astounding regenerative abilities of planarian flatworms prompt a steadily growing interest in examining their molecular foundation. Planarian regeneration was found to require hundreds of genes and is hence a complex process. Thus, RNA interference followed by transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis by RNA-seq is a popular technique to study the impact of any particular planarian gene on regeneration. Typically, the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the first step of all RNA-Seq library preparation protocols. To date, rRNA removal in planarians was primarily achieved by the enrichment of polyadenylated (poly(A)) transcripts. However, to better reflect transcriptome dynamics and to cover also non-poly(A) transcripts, a procedure for the targeted removal of rRNA in planarians is needed.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we describe a workflow for the efficient depletion of rRNA in the planarian model species S. mediterranea. Our protocol is based on subtractive hybridization using organism-specific probes. Importantly, the designed probes also deplete rRNA of other freshwater triclad families, a fact that considerably broadens the applicability of our protocol. We tested our approach on total RNA isolated stem cells (termed neoblasts) of S. mediterranea and compared ribodepleted libraries with publicly available poly(A)-enriched ones. Overall, mRNA levels after ribodepletion were consisted with poly(A) libraries. However, ribodepleted libraries revealed higher transcript levels for transposable elements and histone mRNAs that remained underrepresented in poly(A) libraries. As neoblasts experience high transposon activity this suggests that ribodepleted libraries better reflect the transcriptional dynamics of planarian stem cells. Furthermore, the presented ribodepletion procedure was successfully expanded to the removal of ribosomal RNA from the gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium.\\n\\nConclusionsThe ribodepletion protocol presented here ensures the efficient rRNA removal from low input total planarian RNA, which can be further processed for RNA-Seq applications. Resulting libraries contain less than 2% rRNA. Moreover, for a cost-effective and efficient removal of rRNA prior to sequencing applications our procedure might be adapted to any prokaryotic or eukaryotic species of choice.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications on chromatin play important roles in regulating gene expression. While chromatin states are often governed by multi-layered structure, how individual pathways contribute to gene expression remains poorly understood. For example, DNA methylation is known to regulate transcription factor binding but also to recruit methyl-CpG binding proteins that affect chromatin structure through the activity of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Both of these mechanisms can potentially affect gene expression, but the importance of each, and whether these activities are integrated to achieve appropriate gene regulation, remains largely unknown. To address this important question, we measured gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor occupancy in wild-type or DNA methylation-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells following HDAC inhibition. Interestingly, we observe widespread increases in chromatin accessibility at repeat elements when HDACs are inhibited, and this is magnified when cells also lack DNA methylation. A subset of these elements have elevated binding of the YY1 and GABPA transcription factors and increased expression. The pronounced additive effect of HDAC inhibition in DNA methylation deficient cells demonstrate that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation act largely independently to suppress transcription factor binding and gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Touch can give rise to different sensations including sensory, emotional and social aspects. Tactile pleasure typically associated with caress-like skin stroking of slow velocities (1-10 cm/s) has been hypothesised to relate to an unmyelinated, slow-conducting C-tactile afferent system (CT system), developed to distinguish affective touch from the   noise of other tactile information on hairy skin (the so-called  social touch hypothesis). However, to date, there is no psychometric examination of the discriminative and metacognitive processes that contribute to accurate awareness of pleasant touch stimuli. Over two studies (total N= 194), we combined for the first time CT stimulation with signal detection theory and metacognitive measurements to assess the social touch hypothesis on the role of the CT system in affective touch discrimination. Participants ability to accurately discriminate pleasantness of tactile stimuli of different velocities, as well as their response bias, was assessed using a force-choice task (high versus low pleasantness response) on two different skin sites: forearm (CT-skin) and palm (non-CT skin). We also examined whether such detection accuracy was related to the confidence in their decision (metacognitive sensitivity). Consistently with the social touch hypothesis, we found higher sensitivity d on the forearm versus the palm, indicating that people are better at discriminating between stimuli of high and low tactile pleasantness on a skin site that contains CT afferents. Strikingly, we also found more negative response bias on the forearm versus the palm, indicating a tendency to experience all stimuli on CT-skin as  high-pleasant, with such effects depending on order, likely to be explained by prior touch exposure. Finally, we found that people have greater confidence in their ability to discriminate between affective touch stimuli on CT innervated skin than on non-CT skin, possibly relating to the domain specificity of CT touch hence suggesting a domain-specific, metacognitive hypothesis that can be explored in future studies as an extension of the social touch hypothesis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LITouch mediated by C-tactile (CT) afferents on hairy skin elicits pleasant sensations\\nC_LIO_LIWe combine for the first time CT stimulation with signal detection theory\\nC_LIO_LIBetter accuracy to detect pleasantness of tactile stimuli at CT optimal speeds on CT skin\\nC_LIO_LIHigher confidence in ability to accurately distinguish affective touch on CT skin\\nC_LI",

Here we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and accompanying phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) to validate phenotype-genotype associations of BMI, and to a greater extent, severe Class 2 obesity, using comprehensive diagnostic and clinical data from the EHR database of our cohort. Three GWASs of 500,000 variants on the Illumina platform of 6,645 Healthy Nevada participants identified several published and novel variants that affect BMI and obesity. Each GWAS was followed with two independent PheWASs to examine associations between extensive phenotypes (incidence of diagnoses, condition, or disease), significant SNPs, BMI, and incidence of extreme obesity. The first GWAS excludes DM2-diagnosed individuals and focuses on associations with BMI exclusively. The second GWAS examines the interplay between Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) and BMI. The intersection of significant variants of these two studies is surprising. The third complementary case-control GWAS, with cases defined as extremely obese (Class 2 or 3 obesity), identifies strong associations with extreme obesity, including established variants in the FTO and NEGR1 genes, as well as loci not yet linked to obesity. The PheWASs validate published associations between BMI and extreme obesity and incidence of specific diagnoses and conditions, yet also highlight novel links. This study emphasizes the importance of our extensive longitudinal EHR database to validate known associations and identify putative novel links with BMI and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viral infections play central roles in the initiation, exacerbation and progression of asthma in humans. An acute paramyxoviral infection in mice can cause a chronic lung disease that resembles human asthma. We sought to determine whether reduction of Sendai virus lung burden in mice by stimulating innate immunity with aerosolized Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists could attenuate the severity of chronic asthma-like lung disease. Treatment with 1 {micro}M oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) M362, an agonist of the TLR9 homodimer, and 4 {micro}M Pam2CSK4 (Pam2), an agonist of the TLR2/6 heterodimer, within a few days before or after Sendai virus challenge, resulted in a [~]75% reduction in lung Sendai virus burden five days after challenge. The reduction in acute lung virus burden was associated with marked reductions 49 days after viral challenge in eosinophilic and lymphocytic lung inflammation, airway mucous metaplasia, lumenal mucus occlusion, and hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Mechanistically, ODN/Pam2 treatment attenuated the chronic asthma phenotype by suppressing IL-33 production by type 2 pneumocytes, both by reducing the severity of acute infection and by downregulating Type 2 (allergic) inflammation. These data suggest that treatment of susceptible human hosts with aerosolized ODN and Pam2 at the time of a respiratory viral infection might attenuate the severity of the acute infection and reduce progression of asthma.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryRespiratory viral infections can induce chronic airway disease, and we find that stimulating innate immunity within the lungs of mice reduces the severity of acute infection and development of a chronic asthma phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Many major human pathogens are multi-host pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host-pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host-pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multi-host viruses have a more restricted host range than multi-host bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses--such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne--are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Some East African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities, such as the Sonso chimpanzees, display an unusually limited range of tool-use, but it remains unclear whether this is due to ecological and/or cultural factors. Information on ecological conditions and the diet of the Sonso chimpanzees in relation to neighbouring communities is needed. Here, we studied three adjacent communities in Budongo Forest (Sonso, Waibira, and Kamira), and the presumed core area of an undescribed community (Mwera), in the neighbouring Bugoma Forest. Through line-transects, we investigated (i) whether there were differences in food diversity and abundance between the communities home ranges; (ii) whether the home ranges differed in abundance of sticks and insect nests; and (iii) whether Sonso and Mwera chimpanzees differed in their diet (using faecal samples). Across communities, Sonso had the richest food availability and the lowest insect nest abundance. However, food availability in Mwera, Bugoma, was richer than Budongo communities that neighbour the Sonso territory, suggesting that there may be variation within Budongo. Data from faecal samples replicated our direct observations of food availability suggesting that Sonso chimpanzees had a broader diet than Mwera chimpanzees. This difference in foods availability may partially explain the Sonso chimpanzees lack of stick-tool-use, and low levels of insectivory. The tool repertoire of the other communities is currently unknown; however, we make predictions based on our ecological data. More detailed knowledge of small-scale variation in ecology within and between forest habitats may be important to advancing our understanding of the drivers of tool-use.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT - HIGHLIGHTED STUDENT PAPERTo advance our knowledge of the role of ecological factors in the emergence of tool use in chimpanzees, a nuanced understanding of the ecological conditions different chimpanzee communities experience is needed. We studied four Ugandan chimpanzee communities in two forests. One of these communities, Sonso, in the Budongo Forest, is well-known for its restricted range of tool types, including a total absence of stick use. Food diversity and abundance were highest, and stick tool use opportunities (abundance of sticks and insect nests) were lowest for the core-habitat of the Sonso chimpanzees in contrast to the other communities. We argue that ecological factors play a role in their unusual pattern of tool use, and make predictions about the expected types of tool use in the other communities based on their ecology. Thus, our study provides information that may help advance our understanding of how tool use arises under varied socioecological circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational inheritance of small RNAs is challenging basic concepts of heredity and achieving control over such responses is of great interest. In C. elegans nematodes, small RNAs are transmitted across generations to establish a transgenerational memory trace of ancestral environments and distinguish self from non-self genes. Inheritance of small RNAs is regulated by dedicated machinery and carryover of aberrant heritable small RNA responses was shown to be maladaptive and to induce sterility. Here we show that various types of stress (starvation, high temperatures, and high osmolarity) but not non-stressful changes in cultivation conditions, lead to resetting of small RNA inheritance. We found that stress leads to a genome-wide reduction in heritable small RNA levels and that mutants defective in different stress pathways exhibit irregular RNAi inheritance dynamics. Moreover, we discovered that resetting of heritable RNAi is orchestrated by MAPK pathway factors, the transcription factor SKN-1, and the MET-2 methyltransferase. Termination of small RNA inheritance, and the fact that this process depends on stress, could protect from run-on of environment-irrelevant heritable gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "In the soil-dwelling organism Pseudomonas putida KT2440, the rare earth element (REE)-utilizing and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase PedH is part of a periplasmic oxidation system that is vital for growth on various alcoholic volatiles. Expression of PedH and its Ca2+-dependent counterpart PedE is inversely regulated in response to lanthanide (Ln3+) bioavailability, a mechanism termed the REE-switch. In the present study, we demonstrate that copper, zinc, and in particular, iron availability influences this regulation in a pyoverdine-independent manner by increasing the minimal Ln3+ concentration required for the REE-switch to occur by several orders of magnitude. A combined genetic- and physiological approach reveals that an ABC-type transporter system encoded by the gene cluster pedA1A2BC is essential for efficient growth with low (nanomolar) Ln3+ concentrations. In the absence of pedA1A2BC, a ~100-fold higher La3+ concentration is needed for PedH-dependent growth but not for the ability to repress growth based on PedE activity. From these results, we conclude that cytoplasmic uptake of lanthanides through PedA1A2BC is essential to facilitate REE-dependent growth under environmental conditions with poor REE bioavailability. Our data further suggest that the La3+/Fe3+ ratio impacts the REE-switch through the mismetallation of putative La3+-binding proteins, such as the sensor histidine kinase PedS2, in the presence of high iron concentrations. As such, this study provides an example for the complexity of bacteria-metal interactions and highlights the importance of medium compositions when studying physiological traits in vitro in particular in regards to REE-dependent phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Familiarity with a stimulus leads to an attenuated neural response to the stimulus. Alongside this attenuation, recent studies have also observed a truncation of stimulus-evoked activity for familiar visual input. One proposed function of this truncation is to rapidly put neurons in a state of readiness to respond to new input. Here, we examined this hypothesis by presenting human participants with target stimuli that were embedded in rapid streams of familiar or novel distractor stimuli at different speeds of presentation, while recording brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and measuring behavioral performance. We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of signal truncation and whether this phenomenon bears relationship to participants ability to categorize target items within a visual stream. Behaviorally, target categorization performance was markedly better when the target was embedded within familiar distractors, and this benefit became more pronounced with increasing speed of presentation. Familiar distractors showed a truncation of neural activity in the visual system, and this truncation was strongest for the fastest presentation speeds. Moreover, neural processing of the target was stronger when it was preceded by familiar distractors. Taken together, these findings suggest that truncation of neural responses for familiar items may result in stronger processing of relevant target information, resulting in superior perceptual performance.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe visual response to familiar input is attenuated more rapidly than for novel input. Here we find that this truncation of the neural response for familiar input is strongest for very fast image presentations. We also find a tentative function for this truncation: the neural response to a target image that is embedded within distractors is much greater when the distractors are familiar than when they are novel. Similarly, target categorization performance is much better when the target is embedded within familiar distractors, and this advantage is most obvious for very fast image presentations. This suggests that neural truncation helps to rapidly put neurons in a state of readiness to respond to new input.",

Previous reports have demonstrated that plants transformed with random DNA sequences produce synthetic peptides that affect plant biology. In this report one specific peptide is characterized that inhibits discrete aspects of red-light-mediated Arabidopsis thaliana development during photomorphogenesis. Seedlings expressing the PEP6-32 peptide presented longer hypocotyls and diminished cotyledon expansion when grown under red light. Other red-light-mediated seedling processes such as induction of Lhcb (cab) transcripts or loss of vertical growth remained unaffected. Long-term responses to red light in PEP6-32 expressing plants, such as repression of flowering time, did not show defects in red light signaling or integration. A synthesized peptide applied exogenously induced the long-hypocotyl phenotype under red light in non-transformed seedlings. The results indicate that the PEP6-32 peptide causes discrete cell expansion defects during early seedling development in red light, mimicking weak phyB alleles in some aspects of seedling photomorphogenesis. The findings demonstrate that new chemistries derived from random peptide expression can modulate specific facets of plant growth and development.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA plant line expressing random DNA sequence expresses a synthetic peptide that affects specific red-light responses in a developing seedling.",

    "abstract": "The C9orf72 protein is required for normal lysosome function. In support of such functions, C9orf72 forms a heterotrimeric complex with SMCR8 and WDR41 that is recruited to lysosomes when amino acids are scarce. These properties raise questions about the identity of the lysosomal binding partner of the C9orf72 complex and the amino acid sensing mechanism that regulates C9orf72 complex abundance on lysosomes. We now demonstrate that an interaction with the lysosomal cationic amino acid transporter PQLC2 mediates C9orf72 complex recruitment to lysosomes. This is achieved through an interaction between PQLC2 and WDR41. The interaction between PQLC2 and the C9orf72 complex is negatively regulated by arginine, lysine and histidine, amino acids that PQLC2 transports across the membrane of lysosomes. These results define a new role for PQLC2 in the regulated recruitment of the C9orf72 complex to lysosomes and reveal a novel mechanism that allows cells to sense and respond to changes in the availability of cationic amino acids within lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens is a major enteric pathogen known to cause gastroenteritis in human adults. Although major outbreak cases are frequently reported, limited Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) based studies have been performed to understand the genomic epidemiology and virulence gene content of C. perfringens-associated outbreak strains. We performed both genomic and phylogenetic analysis on 109 C. perfringens strains (human and food) isolated from disease cases in England and Wales between 2011-2017. Initial findings highlighted the enhanced discriminatory power of WGS in profiling outbreak C. perfringens strains, when compared to the current Public Health England referencing laboratory technique of Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (fAFLP). Further analysis identified that isogenic C. perfringens strains were associated with nine distinct care home-associated outbreaks over the course of a 5-year interval, indicating a potential common source linked to these outbreaks or transmission over time and space. As expected the enterotoxin CPE gene was encoded in all but 4 isolates (96.4%; 105/109), with virulence plasmids encoding cpe (particularly pCPF5603- and pCPF4969-family plasmids) extensively distributed (82.6%;90/109). Genes encoding accessory virulence factors, such as beta-2 toxin, were commonly detected (46.7%; 50/109), and genes encoding phage proteins were also frequently identified, with additional analysis indicating their contribution to increased virulence determinants within the genomes of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens. Overall this large-scale genomic study of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens suggested that 3 major sub-types underlie these outbreaks: strains carrying (1) pCPF5603 plasmid, (2) pCPF4969 plasmid, and (3) strains carrying cpe on transposable element Tn5565(usually integrated into chromosome). Our findings indicate that further studies will be required to fully probe this enteric pathogen, particularly in relation to developing intervention and prevention strategies to reduce food poisoning disease burden in vulnerable patients, such as the elderly.",

Here we characterized the small RNA transcriptomes of egg cells and sperm cells from rice to elucidate genome-wide distributions of 24nt siRNAs, which are a hallmark of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants and are typically concentrated at boundaries of heterochromatin. We found that 24nt siRNAs were depleted from heterochromatin boundaries in both gametes, reminiscent of siRNA patterns in DDM1-type nucleosome remodeler mutants. In sperm, 24nt siRNAs were spread across broad heterochromatic regions, while in eggs, 24nt siRNAs were concentrated at a smaller number of heterochromatic loci throughout the genome, which were shared with vegetative tissues and sperm. In both gametes, patterns of CHH methylation, typically a strong indicator of RdDM, were similar to vegetative tissues, although lower in magnitude. These findings indicate that the small RNA transcriptome undergoes large-scale re-programming in both male and female gametes, which is not correlated with recruitment of DNA methyltransferases in gametes and suggestive of unexplored regulatory activities of gamete small RNAs in seeds after fertilization.",

But while everyday mental imagery feels distinct from incoming stimulus input, visual illusions, like hallucinations, are under limited volitional control and appear indistinguishable from physical reality.

In contrast, imagery involves a wide network of brain areas that recruit early visual cortices for the sensory representation of the imagined stimulus. Here, we combine laminar fMRI brain imaging with psychophysical methods and multivariate pattern analysis to investigate in human participants how seemingly  real and imaginary non-physical experiences are processed in primary visual cortex (V1). We find that the content of mental imagery is only decodable in deep layers, whereas illusory content is only decodable at superficial depths. This suggests that feedback to the different layers may serve distinct functions: low-level feedback to superficial layers might be responsible for shaping perception-like experiences, while deep-layer feedback might serve the formation of a more malleable  inner world, separate from ongoing perception.",

    "abstract": "Integrating multiple assessment parameters of motor behavior is critical for understanding neural activity dynamics during motor control in both intact and dysfunctional nervous systems. Here, we described a novel approach (termed Multifactorial Behavioral Assessment (MfBA)) to integrate, in real-time, electrophysiological and biomechanical properties of rodent spinal sensorimotor network activity with behavioral aspects of motor task performance. Specifically, the MfBA simultaneously records limb kinematics, multi-directional forces and electrophysiological metrics, such as high-fidelity chronic intramuscular electromyography synchronized in time to spinal stimulation in order to characterize spinal cord functional motor evoked potentials (fMEPs). Additionally, we designed the MfBA to incorporate a body weight support system to allow bipedal and quadrupedal stepping on a treadmill and in an open field environment to assess function in rodent models of neurologic disorders that impact motor activity This novel approach was validated using, a neurologically intact cohort, a cohort with unilateral Parkinsonian motor deficits due to midbrain lesioning, and a cohort with complete hind limb paralysis due to T8 spinal cord transection. In the SCI cohort, lumbosacral epidural electrical stimulation (EES) was applied, with and without administration of the serotonergic agonist Quipazine, to enable hind limb motor functions following paralysis. The results presented herein demonstrate the MfBA is capable of integrating multiple metrics of motor activity in order to characterize relationships between EES inputs that modulate mono- and polysynaptic outputs from spinal circuitry which in turn, can be used to elucidate underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms of motor behavior by synchronizing these datasets to metrics of movement and behavior. These results also demonstrate that proposed MfBA is an effective tool to integrate biomechanical and electrophysiology metrics, synchronized to therapeutic inputs such as EES or pharmacology, during body weight supported treadmill or open field motor activities, to target a high range of variations in motor behavior as a result of neurological deficit at the different levels of CNS.",

    "abstract": "Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in cortical networks are coupled by gap-junctions, forming a syncytium that supports propagating epileptiform discharges, induced by 4-aminopyridine. It remains unclear, however, whether these propagating events occur under more natural states, without pharmacological blockade. In particular, we investigated whether propagation also happens when extracellular K+ rises, as is known to occur following intense network activity, such as during seizures. We examined how increasing [K+]o affects the likelihood of propagating activity away from a site of focal (200-400{micro}m) optogenetic activation of PV-interneurons. Activity was recorded using a linear 16-electrode array placed along layer V of primary visual cortex. At baseline levels of [K+]o (3.5mM), induced activity was recorded only within the illuminated area. However, when [K+]o was increased above a threshold level (50th percentile= 8.0mM; interquartile range= 7.5-9.5mM), time-locked, fast-spiking unit activity, indicative of parvalbumin-expressing interneuron firing, was also recorded outside the illuminated area, propagating at 59.1 mm/s. Blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission reduced the efficacy of propagation, but could be restored by further increasing [K+]o. Propagation was further reduced, and in most cases prevented altogether, by pharmacological blockade of gap-junctions, achieved by any of three different drugs, quinine, mefloquine or carbenoxolone. Wash-out of quinine rapidly re-established the pattern of propagating activity. Computer simulations show qualitative differences between propagating discharges in high [K+]o and 4-aminopyridine, arising from differences in the electrotonic effects of these two manipulations. These interneuronal syncytial interactions are likely to affect the complex electrographic dynamics of seizures, once [K+]o is raised above this threshold level.\\n\\nSignificance statementWe demonstrate the spatially extended propagation of activity through a gap-junction mediated syncytium of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, in conditions that are known to exist at times within the brain. Previous work has only shown gap-junction coordination very locally, through directly connected cells, or induced at a distance by pharmacological means. We show that cell-class specific spread is facilitated by raised extracellular K+. This is highly pertinent to what happens at the onset of, and during, seizures, when extracellular K+ can rise rapidly to levels well in excess of the measured threshold for propagation. Our data suggests that interneuronal coupling will be enhanced at this time, and this has clear implications for the behaviour of these cells as seizures progress.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural underpinning of conscious perception remains one of the primary challenges of cognitive neuroscience. Theories based mostly on studies of the visual system differ according to whether the neural activity giving rise to conscious perception occurs in modality-specific sensory cortex or in associative areas, such as the frontal and parietal cortices. Here, we search for modality-specific conscious processing in the auditory cortex using a bistable stream segregation paradigm that presents a constant stimulus without the confounding influence of physical changes to sound properties. ABA_ triplets (i.e., alternating low, A, and high, B, tones, and _ gap) with a 700 ms silent response period after every third triplet were presented repeatedly, and human participants reported nearly equivalent proportions of 1- and 2-stream percepts. The pattern of behavioral responses was consistent with previous studies of visual and auditory bistable perception. The intermittent response paradigm has the benefit of evoking spontaneous perceptual switches that can be attributed to a well-defined stimulus event, enabling precise identification of the timing of perception-related neural events with event-related potentials (ERPs). Significantly more negative ERPs were observed for 2-streams compared to 1-stream, and for switches compared to non-switches during the sustained potential (500-1000 ms post-stimulus onset). Further analyses revealed that the negativity associated with switching was independent of switch direction, suggesting that spontaneous changes in perception have a unique neural signature separate from the observation that 2-streams has more negative ERPs than 1-stream. Source analysis of the sustained potential showed activity associated with these differences originating in anterior superior temporal gyrus, indicating involvement of the ventral auditory pathway that is important for processing auditory objects.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhen presented with ambiguous stimuli, the auditory system takes the available information and attempts to construct a useful percept. When multiple percepts are possible from the same stimuli, however, perception fluctuates back and forth between alternating percepts in a bistable manner. Here, we examine spontaneous switches in perception using a bistable auditory streaming paradigm with a novel intermittent stimulus paradigm, and measure sustained electrical activity in anterior portions of auditory cortex using event-related potentials. Analyses revealed enhanced sustained cortical activity when perceiving 2-streams compared to 1-stream, and when a switch occurred regardless of switch direction. These results indicate that neural responses in auditory cortex reflect both the content of perception and neural dynamics related to switches in perception.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell dysfunction drives many age-related disorders. Identifying mechanisms that initially compromise stem cell function represent early targets to enhance stem cell behavior later in life. Here, we pinpoint multiple factors that disrupt neural stem cells (NSC) in the adult hippocampus. We find that NSCs exhibit asynchronous maintenance by identifying short-term (ST-NSC) and intermediate-term NSCs (IT-NSCs). ST-NSC divide rapidly to generate neurons and deplete in the young brain. Meanwhile, multipotent IT-NSCs persist for months, but are pushed out of homeostasis by lengthening quiescence. Single cell transcriptome analysis of deep NSC quiescence revealed several hallmarks of biological aging in the mature brain and identified tyrosine-protein kinase Abl1 as an NSC pro-aging factor. Treatment with the Abl-inhibitor Imatinib increased NSC proliferation without impairing NSC maintenance in the middle-aged brain. Further intersectional analysis of mature NSC with old epidermal, hematopoietic and muscle stem cell transcriptomes identified consensus changes in stem cell aging. Our study elucidates multiple origins of adult neurogenesis decline and reveals that hippocampal NSCs are particularly vulnerable to a shared stem cell aging signature.",

    "abstract": "RationaleAccumulating evidence point to a role for primary cilia in endothelial cell function. Islet vascularization is an important determinant of islet function and glucose homeostasis. We have previously shown that {beta}-cell cilia directly regulate insulin secretion. However, it is unclear whether primary cilia are also implicated in islet vascularization and thus contribute to glucose homeostasis.\\n\\nObjectiveTo characterize the role of primary cilia in islet vascularization.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsAt four weeks, Bbs4-/- islets show markedly lower intra-islet capillary density with enlarged diameters. We transplanted islets into the anterior chamber (ACE) of mouse eyes for longitudinal and non-invasive in vivo monitoring of vascular morphology. Bbs4-/- islets exhibited significantly delayed re-vascularization and enlarged vessels during engraftment. Similar vascular phenotypes were observed in two other ciliopathy models. By shifting the relative contributions of host versus donor endothelial cells in islet revascularization, we found that primary cilia on endothelial cells is essential for this process. Electron microscopy analysis further revealed a lack of fenestration in engrafted Bbs4-/- islets, partially impairing vascular permeability and glucose delivery to {beta}-cells. Finally, we identified that Vascular endothelial cell growth factor A (VEGF-A)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signalling is involved in islet vascularization, islet function and vascular fenestration. In vitro silencing of two different ciliary genes in endothelial cells disrupts VEGF-A/ VEGFR2 internalization and phospho-activation of downstream signalling components. Consequently, key features of angiogenesis including proliferation, migration and tube formation are attenuated in BBS4 silenced endothelial cells.\\n\\nConclusionsEndothelial cell primary cilia regulate islet vascularization and vascular barrier function via VEGF-A/ VEGFR2 signaling pathway. Islet vascularization is impaired in four weeks old Bbs4-/- mice. Long-time monitoring of re-vascularization of WT and Bbs4-/- islets recapitulates the phenotype and demonstrates a role for cilia in islet vascularization and vascular barrier function. VEGF-A/ VEGFR2-dependent signalling is regulated by endothelial primary cilia.",

    "abstract": "During embryogenesis, the distinct morphogenetic cell behavior programs that shape tissues are influenced both by the fate of cells and their position with respect to the embryonic axes, making embryonic patterning a prerequisite for morphogenesis. These two essential processes must therefore be coordinated in space and time to ensure proper development, but mechanisms by which patterning information is translated to the cellular machinery that drives morphogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we address the role of Nodal morphogen signaling at the intersection of cell fate specification, patterning, and anteroposterior (AP) axis extension in zebrafish gastrulae and embryonic explants. AP axis extension is impaired in Nodal-deficient embryos, but it is unclear whether this defect is strictly secondary to their severe mesendoderm deficiencies or also results from loss of Nodal signaling per se. We find that convergence & extension (C&E) gastrulation movements and underlying mediolateral (ML) cell polarization are reduced in the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient mutants and exacerbated by simultaneous disruption of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling, demonstrating at least partially parallel functions of Nodal and PCP. ML polarity of mutant neuroectoderm cells is not fully restored upon transplantation into wild-type gastrulae, demonstrating a cell autonomous, mesoderm-independent role for Nodal in neural cell polarization. This is further demonstrated by the ability of Nodal ligands to promote neuroectoderm-driven C&E of naive blastoderm explants in a tissue-autonomous fashion. Finally, temporal manipulation of signaling reveals that Nodal contributes to neural C&E in explants after mesoderm is specified and promotes C&E even in the absence of mesoderm. Together these results reveal a mesoderm-independent, cell-autonomous role for Nodal signaling in neural C&E that may cooperate with previously-described mesoderm-dependent mechanisms to drive AP embryonic axis extension.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons degenerate resulting in muscle atrophy, paralysis and fatality. Studies using mouse models of ALS indicate a protracted period of disease development with progressive motor neuron pathology, evident as early as embryonic and postnatal stages. Key missing information includes concomitant alterations in the sensorimotor circuit essential for normal development and function of the neuromuscular system. Leveraging unique brainstem circuitry, we show in vitro evidence for reflex circuit-specific postnatal abnormalities in the jaw proprioceptive sensory neurons in the well-studied SOD1G93A mouse. These include impaired and arrhythmic action potential burst discharge associated with a deficit in Nav1.6 Na+ channels. However, the mechanoreceptive and nociceptive trigeminal ganglion neurons and the visual sensory retinal ganglion neurons were resistant to excitability changes in age matched SOD1G93A mice.

Our findings suggest that these proprioceptive sensory neurons are exclusively afflicted early in the disease process relative to sensory neurons of other modalities. Moreover, they presented Nav1.6 Na+ channel deficiency which contributed to arrhythmic burst discharge.

    "abstract": "The heptad repeating sequence of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is highly conserved in eukaryotes. In yeast, a CTD code consisting of pairs of heptad repeats is essential for viability. However, the strict requirement of diheptad repeats for the CTD function in transcription and splicing is unexplained. Here we show that CoAA (gene symbol RBM14), an oncoprotein and mammalian transcriptional coactivator, possesses diheptad repeats and directly interacts with the CTD. CoAA comprises 27 copies of tyrosine-rich repeats and regulates pre-mRNA synthesis and alternative splicing. Tyrosine substitutions in either the CoAA repeats or the CTD repeats diminish their interactions. Ser2- or Ser5-phosphorylated CTD peptides exhibit higher binding affinity to CoAA than the corresponding non-phosphorylated CTD peptide. CoAA dynamically interacts with both the CTD and hnRNP M, which is an alternative splicing regulator also comprising diheptad repeats. Arginine methylation of CoAA switches its interaction from the hnRNP M repeats to the CTD repeats. This study provides a mechanism for CoAA at the interface of transcription and alternative splicing, and explains the functional requirement of diheptad repeats in the CTD. In the human genome, tyrosine-rich repeats similar to the CoAA repeats were only found in six oncoproteins including EWS and SYT. We suggest that the diheptad sequence is one of the signature features for the CTD interaction among oncoproteins involved in transcription and alternative splicing. We anticipate that direct RNA Pol II interaction is a mechanism in oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In prior work we demonstrated that loss of E2F transcription factors inhibits metastasis. Here we address the mechanisms for this phenotype and identify the E2F regulated genes that coordinate tumor cell metastasis. Transcriptomic profiling of E2F1 knockout tumors identified a role for E2F1 as a master regulator of a suite of pro-metastatic genes, but also uncovered E2F1 target genes with an unknown role in pulmonary metastasis. High expression of one of these genes, Fgf13, is associated with early human breast cancer metastasis in a clinical dataset. Together these data led to the hypothesis that Fgf13 is critical for breast cancer metastasis, and that upregulation of Fgf13 may partially explain how E2F1 promotes breast cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis we ablated Fgf13 via CRISPR. Deletion of Fgf13 in a MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cell line reduces the frequency of pulmonary metastasis. In addition, loss of Fgf13 reduced in vitro cell migration, suggesting that Fgf13 may be critical for tumor cells to invade out of and escape the primary tumor. The significance of this work is twofold: we have both uncovered genomic features by which E2F1 regulates metastasis and we have identified new pro-metastatic functions for the E2F1 target gene Fgf13.",
