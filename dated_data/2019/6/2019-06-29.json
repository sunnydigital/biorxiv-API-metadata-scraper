    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell heterogeneity prevails in many biological systems, although its origin and function are often unclear. Cell hydrostatic pressure, alias turgor pressure, is essential in physiology and morphogenesis, and its spatial variations are often overlooked. Here, based on a mathematical model describing cell mechanics and water movement in a plant tissue, we predict that cell pressure anticorrelates with cell neighbour number. Using atomic force microscopy, we confirm this prediction in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem, a population of stem cells that generate all plant aerial organs. Pressure is predicted to correlate either positively or negatively with cellular growth rate depending on osmotic drive, cell wall extensibility, and hydraulic conductivity. The meristem exhibits one of these two regimes depending on conditions, suggesting that, in this tissue, water conductivity is non-negligible in growth control. Our results illustrate links between local topology, cell mechanical state and cell growth, with potential roles in tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme in the biosphere and one of the best-characterized enzymes. Based on correlations between Rubisco kinetic parameters, it is widely posited that tradeoffs embedded in the catalytic mechanism constrain its specificity and maximum catalytic rate. However, the reasoning that established this view was based on data from {approx}20 organisms. We re-examine these tradeoff models using a dataset from {approx}300 organisms. Most correlations are substantially attenuated, with the inverse relationship between carboxylation kcat and specificity SC/O being a key example. Only one tradeoff model survives in our dataset. In this model, increasing catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for carboxylation requires increased catalytic efficiency for the competing oxygenation reaction, evidenced by strong power-law correlation between catalytic efficiencies. Our results imply that Rubisco evolution is constrained primarily by the physicochemical limits of O2/CO2 discrimination, which should reframe efforts to engineer this very central enzyme.",

    "abstract": "The activity of Src-family kinases (SFKs), which phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), is critical factor regulating myeloid-cell activation. In a previous paper (Freedman et al., 2015) we showed in macrophages that the SFK LynA is uniquely susceptible to rapid ubiquitin-mediated degradation, functioning as a rheostat regulating ITAM signaling. We now report the mechanism by which LynA is preferentially targeted for degradation and how cell specificity is built into the LynA rheostat. Using genetic and biochemical analysis, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets LynA via tyrosine 32 in its unique insert region. This orthogonal mode of c-Cbl recognition depresses the steady-state level of macrophage LynA. Mast cells, however, express little c-Cbl and have correspondingly high steady-state levels of LynA. Upon activation, mast-cell LynA is not rapidly degraded, and SFK-mediated signaling is amplified relative to macrophages. Cell-specific c-Cbl expression therefore builds cell specificity into the LynA checkpoint.",

    "abstract": "Patients with hippocampal amnesia play a central role in memory neuroscience but the neural underpinnings of amnesia are hotly debated. We hypothesized that focal hippocampal damage is associated with changes across the extended hippocampal system and that these, rather than hippocampal atrophy per se, would explain variability in memory between patients. We assessed this hypothesis in a uniquely large cohort of patients (n=38) after autoimmune limbic encephalitis, a syndrome associated with focal structural hippocampal pathology. These patients showed impaired recall, recognition and maintenance of new information, and remote autobiographical amnesia. Besides hippocampal atrophy, we observed correlatively reduced thalamic volume, resting-state inter-hippocampal connectivity and activity in posteromedial cortex. Associations of hippocampal volume with recall, recognition, and remote memory were fully mediated by wider network abnormalities, and were only direct in forgetting. Such network abnormalities may explain the variability across studies of amnesia and speak to theoretical debates in memory neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Metabolically quiescent pathogens can persist in a viable non-replicating state for months or even years. For certain infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, latent infection is a corollary of this dormant state, which has the risk for reactivation and clinical disease. During murine cryptococcosis and macrophage uptake, stress and host immunity induce C. neoformans heterogeneity with the generation of a sub-population of yeasts that manifests a phenotype compatible with dormancy (low stress response, latency of growth). In this subpopulation, mitochondrial transcriptional activity is regulated and this phenotype has been considered as a hallmark of quiescence in stem cells. Based on these findings, we worked to reproduce this phenotype in vitro and then standardize the experimental conditions to consistently generate this dormancy in Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\nWe found that incubation of stationary phase yeasts (STAT) in nutriment limited conditions and hypoxia for 8 days (8D-HYPOx) was able to produced cells that mimic the phenotype obtained in vivo. In these conditions, mortality and/or apoptosis occurred in less than 5% of the yeasts compared to 30-40% of apoptotic or dead yeasts upon incubation in normoxia (8D-NORMOx). Yeasts in 8D-HYPOx harbored a lower stress response, delayed growth and less that 1% of culturability on agar plates, suggesting that these yeasts are viable but non culturable cells (VBNC). These VBNC were able to reactivate in the presence of pantothenic acid, a vitamin that is known to be involved in quorum sensing and a precursor of acetyl-CoA. Global metabolism of 8D-HYPOx cells showed some specific requirements and was globally shut down compared to 8D-NORMOx and STAT conditions. Mitochondrial analyses showed that the mitochondrial masse increased with mitochondria mostly depolarized in 8D-HYPOx compared to 8D-NORMox, with increased expression of mitochondrial genes. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of 8D-HYPOx revealed that the number of secreted proteins and transcripts detected also decreased compared to 8D-NORMOx and STAT, and the proteome, secretome and transcriptome harbored specific profiles that are engaged as soon as four days of incubation. Importantly, acetyl-CoA and the fatty acid pathway involving mitochondria are required for the generation and viability maintenance of VBNC.\n\nAll together, these data show that we were able to generate for the first time VBNC phenotype in Cryptococcocus neoformans. This VBNC state is associated with a specific metabolism that should be further studied to understand dormancy/quiescence in this yeast.",

Here we report the 1.2-Gbp draft genome of C. augens and results from comparative genomic analyses with other arthropods. In C. augens we uncovered the largest chemosensory gene repertoire of ionotropic receptors in the animal kingdom, a massive expansion which might compensate for the loss of vision. We found a paucity of photoreceptor genes mirroring at the genomic level the secondary loss of an ancestral external photoreceptor organ. Expansions of detoxification and carbohydrate metabolism gene families might reflect adaptations for foraging behaviour, and duplicated apoptotic genes might underlie its high regenerative potential.\\n\\nThe C. augens genome represents one of the key references for studying the emergence of genomic innovations in insects, the most diverse animal group, and opens up novel opportunities to study the under-explored biology of diplurans.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-8 proteins are microtubule motors that are often involved in regulation of mitotic spindle length and chromosome alignment. They move towards the ends of spindle microtubules and regulate the dynamics of these ends due, at least in some species, to their microtubule depolymerization activity. Plasmodium spp. exhibit an atypical endomitotic cell division in which chromosome condensation and spindle dynamics are not well understood in the different proliferative stages. Genome-wide homology analysis of Plasmodium spp. revealed the presence of two Kinesin-8 motor proteins (Kinesin-8X and Kinesin-8B). Here we have studied the biochemical properties of Kinesin-8X and its role in parasite proliferation. In vitro, Kinesin-8X showed motile and depolymerization activities like other Kinesin-8 motors. To understand its role in cell division, we have used protein tagging and live cell imaging to define the location of Plasmodium Kinesin-8X during all proliferative stages of the P berghei life cycle. Furthermore, we have used gene targeting to analyse the function of Kinesin-8X. The results reveal a spatio-temporal involvement of Kinesin-8X in spindle dynamics and its association with both mitotic and meiotic spindles and the putative microtubule organising centre (MTOC). Deletion of the Kinesin-8X gene showed that this protein is required for endomitotic division during oocyst development and is therefore necessary for parasite replication within the mosquito gut, and for transmission to the vertebrate host. Consistently, transcriptome analysis of{Delta} kinesin-8X parasites reveals modulated expression of genes involved mainly in microtubule-based processes, chromosome organisation and the regulation of gene expression supporting a role in cell division.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKinesins are microtubule-based motors that play key roles in intracellular transport, cell division and motility. Members of the Kinesin-8 family contribute to chromosome alignment during cell division in many eukaryotes. However, the roles of kinesins in the atypical cell division in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is not known. In contrast to many other eukaryotes, Plasmodium proliferates by endomitosis, in which genome replication and division occur within a nucleus bounded by a persistent nuclear envelope. We show that the Plasmodium genome encodes only nine kinesins and we further investigate the role of Kinesin-8X throughout the Plasmodium life cycle using biochemical and gene targeting approaches. We show that Plasmodium Kinesin-8X has microtubule-based motility and depolymerization activity. We also show that Kinesin-8X is probably localized on putative MTOCs and spindles during cell division in most of the stages of P. berghei life cycle. By gene deletion we demonstrate that Kinesin-8X is essential for normal oocyst development and sporozoite formation. Genome-wide RNA analysis of{Delta} kinesin-8X parasites reveals modulated expression of genes involved in microtubule-based processes. Overall, the data suggest that Kinesin-8X is a molecular motor that plays essential roles during endomitosis in oocyst development in the mosquito, contributing to parasite transmission.",

    "abstract": "Mouse Apolipoprotein L9 is a 34-kDa phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein. The gene is present only in mouse and rat genomes; hence it is taxonomically restricted. To understand why, it is essential to uncover details about its functions in cellular processes. Here we show that ApoL9 interacts with the proteins of the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies, which are key players in macroautophagy. In amino-acid starved cells it preferentially interacts with lipidated LC3B, likely by binding to its PE moiety. On treatment with autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, ApoL9 is found near swollen mitochondria and on lysosomes/LAMP1-positive compartments. However, ApoL9 itself does not seem to be degraded as a result of autophagy, suggesting that it is not an autophagy cargo receptor. Deletions in a putative transmembrane region between amino acids 110 and 145 abolish PE-binding. In addition, ApoL9 can redistribute to stress granules, can homooligomerize, and is a microtubule-associated protein. In short, its distribution in the cell is quite widespread, suggesting that it could have functions at the intersection of membrane binding and reorganization, autophagy, cellular stress and intracellular lipid transport.\\n\\nSummary statementThis article is about how Apolipoprotein L9, a lipid-binding protein, has versatile properties and influences a variety of processes taking place inside an animal cell.",

    "abstract": "Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5-12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has neither addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, nor dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings for the sensory cues. Moreover, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over ones lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes within immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and cues them during SWOs. In particular, we demonstrate that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses to temporally coincide with UP states of SWOs (0.4167 - 1 s) on two consecutive nights to achieve about 20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes at 48 hours after the one-shot viewing, compared to the control episodes. Post-sleep metamemory of the targeted episodes was driven by an interaction between their pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications for those episodes during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases from 6.18 to 6.7 s following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (9-12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is necessary for appropriate appraisal of stressful information, as well as coordinating visceral and behavioral processes. However, prolonged stress impairs mPFC function and prefrontal-dependent behaviors. Additionally, chronic stress induces sympathetic predominance, contributing to health detriments associated with autonomic imbalance. Previous studies identified a subregion of rodent prefrontal cortex, infralimbic cortex (IL), as a key regulator of neuroendocrine-autonomic integration after chronic stress, suggesting that IL output may prevent chronic stress-induced autonomic imbalance. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the IL regulates hemodynamic, vascular, and cardiac responses to chronic stress. To address this hypothesis, a viral-packaged siRNA construct was used to knockdown vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) and reduce glutamate packaging and release from IL projection neurons. Male rats were injected with a vGluT1 siRNA-expressing construct or GFP control into the IL and then remained as unstressed controls or were exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS). IL vGluT1 knockdown increased heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) reactivity, while CVS increased chronic MAP only in siRNA-treated rats. In a separate cohort, CVS and vGluT1 knockdown interacted to impair both endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasoreactivity ex vivo. Furthermore, vGluT1 knockdown and CVS increased histological markers of fibrosis and hypertrophy. Thus, knockdown of glutamate release from IL projection neurons indicates that these cells are necessary to prevent the enhanced physiological responses to stress that promote susceptibility to cardiovascular pathophysiology. Ultimately, these findings provide evidence for a neurobiological mechanism mediating the relationship between stress and poor cardiovascular health outcomes.\\n\\nClinical perspectiveWhat is new?

Reverse genetics have facilitated genome-scale knockout screens in Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii, in which pooled transfections of multiple vectors were critical to increasing scale and throughput. These approaches have not yet been implemented in P. falciparum, mainly because the extent to which pooled transfections can be performed in this species still remains unknown. Here we use next-generation sequencing to quantitate uptake of a pool of 94 barcoded vectors. The distribution of vectors in different transfections allowed us to estimate the number of barcodes and DNA molecules taken up by the parasite population. Dilution cloning showed that single transfected parasites routinely carry as many as seven episomal barcodes, revealing an intake of multiple vectors in a highly non-uniform fashion. Transfection of non-overlapping fluorescent proteins, which allowed us to follow the dynamics of the process, confirmed the tendency for parasites to take up multiple vectors from the early stages of transfection. This finding has important implications for how reverse genetics can be scaled in P. falciparum.",

By using genetic and molecular analyses in vivo, we show that a small network of basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors controls both stemness and bi-potential differentiation in the Drosophila adult intestine. We find that homodimers of Daughterless (Da, homolog to mammalian E proteins) maintain the self-renewal of intestinal stem cells and antagonise the activity of heterodimers of Da and Scute (Sc, homolog to ASCL and known to promote intestinal secretory differentiation). We find a novel role for the HLH factor Extramacrochaetae (Emc, homolog to Id proteins), titrating Da and Sc to promote absorptive differentiation. We further show that Emc prevents committed absorptive progenitors from de-differentiating, underscoring the plasticity of these cells. Switching physical interaction partners in this way enables the active maintenance of stemness, but primes stem cells for differentiation along two alternative fates. Such regulatory logic could be recapitulated in other bipotent stem cell systems.",

    "abstract": "The brain is a vulnerable metabolic organ and must adapt to different fuel conditions to sustain function. Nerve terminals are a locus of this vulnerability but how they regulate ATP synthesis as fuel conditions vary is unknown. We show that synapses can switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism, but to do so, they rely on activity-driven presynaptic mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to accelerate ATP production. We demonstrate that while in non-neuronal cells mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake requires elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+, axonal mitochondria readily take up Ca2+ in response to small changes in Ca2+. We identified the brain-specific protein MICU3 as a critical driver of this tuning of Ca2+ sensitivity. Ablation of MICU3 renders axonal mitochondria similar to non-neuronal mitochondria, prevents acceleration of local ATP synthesis, and impairs presynaptic function under oxidative conditions. Thus, presynaptic mitochondria rely on MICU3 to facilitate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during activity and achieve metabolic flexibility.\\n\\nO_LISynapses rely on activity-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis with oxidative fuels\\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is required to stimulate ATP synthesis in axons\\nC_LIO_LIThe mitochondria Ca2+ uptake threshold is lower in axons than in non-neuronal cells\\nC_LIO_LIMICU3 controls the Ca2+ sensitivity of MCU in axonal mitochondria\\nC_LI",

Chromatin remodeling complexes regulate critical processes during gamete development by restricting or promoting accessibility of DNA repair and gene expression machineries to the chromatin. Here, we investigated the role of CHD4 and CHD3 catalytic subunits of the NURD complex during spermatogenesis. Germ cell-specific deletion of Chd4 early in gametogenesis, but not Chd3, resulted in arrested early gamete development due to failed cell survival of neonate undifferentiated spermatogonia stem cell population. Candidate assessment revealed that CHD4 controls expression of Dmrt1 and its downstream target Plzf, both described as prominent regulators of spermatogonia stem cell maintenance. Our results show the requirement of CHD4 in mammalian gametogenesis pointing to functions in gene expression early in the process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms of immune regulation is key to developing immunotherapies for autoimmunity and cancer. We examined the role of mononuclear phagocytes during peripheral T cell regulation in type 1 diabetes and melanoma. MERTK expression and activity in mononuclear phagocytes in the pancreatic islets, promoted islet T cell regulation, resulting in reduced sensitivity of T cell scanning for cognate antigen in pre-diabetic islets. MERTK-dependent regulation led to reduced T cell activation and effector function at the disease site in the islets and prevented rapid progression of type 1 diabetes. In human islets, MERTK-expressing cells were increased in remaining insulin-containing islets of type 1 diabetic patients, suggesting that MERTK protects the islets from autoimmune destruction. MERTK also regulated T cell arrest in melanoma tumors. These data indicate that MERTK signaling in mononuclear phagocytes drives T cell regulation at inflammatory disease sites in peripheral tissues through a mechanism that reduces the sensitivity of scanning for antigen leading to reduced responsiveness to antigen.",

ATP driven remodeling enzymes are known to be crucial for its establishment in vivo, but their non-equilibrium nature has hindered the development of a unified theoretical framework for nucleosome positioning. Using a perturbation theory, we show that the effect of these enzymes can be well approximated by effective equilibrium models with rescaled temperatures and interactions. Numerical simulations support the accuracy of the theory in predicting both kinetic and steady-state quantities, including the effective temperature and the radial distribution function, in biologically relevant regimes. The energy landscape view emerging from our study provides an intuitive understanding for the impact of remodeling enzymes in either reinforcing or overwriting intrinsic signals for nucleosome positioning, and may help improve the accuracy of computational models for its prediction in silico.",

    "abstract": "A subset of genes in plant genomes are labeled with DNA methylation specifically at CG residues. These genes, known as gene-body methylated (gbM), have a number of associated characteristics. They tend to have longer sequences, to be enriched for intermediate expression levels, and to be associated with slower rates of molecular evolution. Most importantly, gbM genes tend to maintain their level of DNA methylation between species, suggesting that this trait is under evolutionary constraint. Given the degree of conservation in gbM, we still know surprisingly little about its function in plant genomes or whether gbM is itself a target of selection. To address these questions, we surveyed DNA methylation across eight grass (Poaceae) species that span a gradient of genome sizes. We first established that genome size correlates with genome-wide DNA methylation levels, but less so for genic levels. We then leveraged genomic data to identify a set of 2,982 putative orthologs among the eight species and examined shifts of methylation status for each ortholog in a phylogenetic context. A total of 55% of orthologs exhibited a shift in gbM, but these shifts occurred predominantly on terminal branches, indicating that shifts in gbM are rarely conveyed over time. Finally, we found that the degree of conservation of gbM across species is associated with increased gene length, reduced rates of molecular evolution, and increased gene expression level, but reduced gene expression variation across species. Overall, these observations suggest a basis for evolutionary pressure to maintain gbM status over evolutionary time.",

    "abstract": "Sound localization in reverberant environments is a difficult task that human listeners perform effortlessly. Many neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for this behavior. Generally they rely on emphasizing localization information at the onset of the incoming sound while discarding localization cues that arrive later. We modelled several of these mechanisms using neural circuits commonly found in the brain and tested their performance in the context of experiments showing that, in the dominant frequency region for sound localisation, we have a preference for auditory cues arriving during the rising slope of the sound energy (Dietz et al., 2013). We found that both single cell mechanisms (onset and adaptation) and population mechanisms (lateral inhibition) were easily able to reproduce the results across a very wide range of parameter settings. This suggests that sound localization in reverberant environments may not require specialised mechanisms specific to perform that task, but could instead rely on common neural circuits in the brain. This would allow for the possibility of individual differences in learnt strategies or neuronal parameters. This research is fully reproducible, and we made our code available to edit and run online via interactive live notebooks.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are important predictors for outcome, independence and quality of life after stroke, but often remain unnoticed and unattended because other impairments are more evident. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is among the candidate interventions that may alleviate cognitive difficulties, but the evidence supporting its feasibility and effectiveness is scarce, partly due to the lack of tools for outcome prediction and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides candidate markers for disease monitoring and outcome prediction. By integrating information not only about lesion extent and localization, but also regarding the integrity of the unaffected parts of the brain, advanced MRI provides relevant information for developing better prediction models in order to tailor cognitive intervention for patients, especially in a chronic phase.\\n\\nUsing brain age prediction based on MRI based brain morphometry and machine learning, we tested the hypotheses that stroke patients with a younger-appearing brain relative to their chronological age perform better on cognitive tests and benefit more from cognitive training compared to patients with an older-appearing brain. In this randomized double-blind study, 54 patients who suffered mild stroke (>6 months since hospital admission, NIHSS<7 at hospital discharge) underwent 3-weeks CCT and MRI before and after the intervention. In addition, patients were randomized to one of two groups receiving either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We tested for main effects of brain age gap (estimated age - chronological age) on cognitive performance, and associations between brain age gap and task improvement. Finally, we tested if longitudinal changes in brain age gap during the intervention were sensitive to treatment response. Briefly, our results suggest that longitudinal brain age prediction based on automated brain morphometry is feasible and reliable in stroke patients. However, no significant association between brain age and both performance and response to cognitive training were found.",

As such, WMHs have been targeted as a surrogate biomarker in intervention trials with older adults. However, it is unclear at what stage of aging WMHs begin to relate to cognition and if they may be a viable target for early prevention. In a population-representative birth cohort of 843 45-year-olds we measured WMHs using T2-weighted MRI, and we assessed cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. We found that WMHs were common at age 45 and that WMH volume was modestly associated with both lower childhood ({beta}=-0.08, p=0.013) and adult IQ ({beta}=-0.15, p<0.001). Moreover, WMH volume was associated with greater cognitive decline from childhood to midlife ({beta}=-0.09, p<0.001). Our results demonstrate that a link between WMHs and early signs of cognitive decline is detectable decades before clinical symptoms of dementia emerge. Thus, WMHs may be a useful surrogate biomarker for identifying individuals in midlife at risk for future accelerated cognitive decline and selecting participants for dementia prevention trials.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) continues to be amongst the most addictive and abused drugs in the US. Unfortunately, there are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments for METH substance abuse disorder. As an alternative approach, we have previously explored the use of Adeno-associated viral (AAV) mediated gene transfer of an anti-METH monoclonal antibody. Here, we advance our approach by generating a novel anti-METH scFv-Fc fusion construct (7F9-Fc), packaged into AAV serotype 8 vector (called AAV-scFv-Fc), and tested in vivo and ex vivo. A range of doses (1 x 1010. 1 x 1011, and 1 x 1012 vector copies(vc)/mouse) were administered to mice, which exhibited a dose-dependent expression of 7F9-Fc in serum with peak circulating concentrations of 48, 1785, and 3,831 g/ml. The dose of 1 x 1012 vc/mouse was further tested in METH locomotor and biodistribution studies to determine the efficacy of the antibody protection. Expressed 7F9-Fc exhibited high affinity binding, 17 nM, to METH. Between days 21 and 35 after vector administration, the 7F9-Fc gene therapy significantly reduced the effects of METH in locomotor assays following administration of moderate and high doses of subcutaneous METH, 3.1 and 9.4 mg/kg respectively. On day 116 post-AAV administration, mice expressing 7F9-Fc sequestered over 2.5 times more METH into the serum than vehicle mice, and METH concentrations in the brain were reduced by 1.2 times compared to vehicle mice. Taken together, these data suggest that a AAV-delivered anti-METH Fc fusion antibody could be a design for persistently reducing concentrations of METH in the CNS.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn this manuscript, we describe the use of a novel anti-METH scFv-Fc fusion protein delivered in mice using gene therapy. The results suggest that the gene therapy delivery system can lead to the production of enough antibody to mitigate METHs psychostimulant effects in mice over an extended time period.",

Here we demonstrate that FITZAP, an intrinsically disordered sperm protein in the marine mollusk abalone, exploits differences in the intracellular and oceanic ionic environments to package the fertilization protein lysin at extraordinary concentrations inside sperm by forming Fuzzy Interacting Transient Zwitterion (FITZ) complexes. FITZAP binds lysin at the same protein interface as its egg receptor VERL, and as sexual selection rapidly alters the lysin-VERL interface, FITZAP coevolves rapidly to maintain lysin binding. Consequently, FITZAP-lysin interactions exhibit a similar species-specificity as lysin-VERL interactions. Thus, tethered molecular arms races driven by sexual selection can generally explain rapid sperm protein evolution.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryStructural study of sperm proteins reveals a novel protein packaging/dispersion system embedded in a coevolutionary arms race.",

    "abstract": "In order to deal with their huge volume and complex morphology, neurons localize mRNAs and ribosomes near synapses to produce proteins locally. A relative paucity of polyribosomes (considered the active sites of translation) detected in electron micrographs of neuronal processes (axons and dendrites), however, has suggested a rather limited capacity for local protein synthesis. Polysome profiling together with ribosome footprinting of microdissected synaptic regions revealed that a surprisingly high number of dendritic and/or axonal transcripts were predominantly associated with monosomes (single ribosomes). Contrary to prevailing views, the neuronal monosomes were in the process of active protein synthesis (e.g. they exhibited elongation). Most mRNAs showed a similar translational status in both compartments, but some transcripts exhibited differential ribosome occupancy in the somata and neuropil. Strikingly, monosome-preferred transcripts often encoded high-abundance synaptic proteins. This work suggests a significant contribution of monosome translation to the maintenance of the local neuronal proteome. This mode of translation can presumably solve some of restricted space issues (given the large size of polysomes) and also increase the diversity of proteins made from a limited number of ribosomes available in dendrites and axons.",
