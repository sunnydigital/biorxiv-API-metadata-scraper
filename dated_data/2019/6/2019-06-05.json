    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening invasive lung infections in immunodeficient patients. The cellular and molecular processes of infection during onset, establishment and progression are highly complex and depend on both fungal attributes and the immune status of the host. Therefore, preclinical animal models are paramount to investigate and gain better insight into the infection process. Yet, despite their extensive use, commonly employed murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are not well understood due to analytical limitations. Here we present quantitative light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to describe fungal growth and the local immune response in whole lungs at cellular resolution within its anatomical context. We analyzed three very common murine models of pulmonary aspergillosis based on immunosuppression with corticosteroids, chemotherapy-induced leukopenia or myeloablative irradiation. LSFM uncovered distinct architectures of fungal growth and degrees of tissue invasion in each model. Furthermore, LSFM revealed the spatial distribution, interaction and activation of two key immune cell populations in antifungal defense: alveolar macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Interestingly, the patterns of fungal growth correlated with the detected effects of the immunosuppressive regimens on the local immune cell populations. Moreover, LSFM demonstrates that the commonly used intranasal route of spore administration did not result in the desired intra-alveolar deposition, as more than 60% of fungal growth occurred outside of the alveolar space. Hence, LSFM allows for more rigorous characterization of murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pinpointing their strengths and limitations.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe use of animal models of infection is essential to advance our understanding of complex host-pathogen interactions that take place during Aspergillus fumigatus lung infections. As in the case of humans, mice need to be immunosuppressed to become susceptible to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the most serious infection caused by A. fumigatus. There are several immunosuppressive regimens that are routinely used to investigate fungal growth and/or immune responses in murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, the precise consequences that each immunosuppressive model has on the local immune populations and for fungal growth are not completely understood. Here we employed light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to analyze whole lungs at cellular resolution, to pin down the scenario commonly used IPA models. Our results will be valuable to optimize and refine animal models to maximize their use in future research.\\n\\nVISUAL ABSTRACTQuantitative light sheet fluorescence microscopy to dissect local host-pathogen interactions in the lung after A. fumigatus airway infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/661157v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (42K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4baf31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dad3c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84aab9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e45c0d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a field study that examined the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in anti-poaching enforcement in parks and game reserves. In the field study, a UAV attempted to spot mock poachers while the mock poachers tried to spot the UAV. The field study was conducted at N/aan ku se, an operational game reserve in the central region of Namibia. In total, 118 trials were completed, providing 236 UAV-poacher interdiction scenarios. Of these, 198 were during the day, 152 with a quadcopter and 46 with a fixed-wing. Live spotting success during the day varied due to the hiding behavior of the mock poachers, with the highest and lowest success rates of spotting being 86% for poachers in the open and 25% for poachers hiding under canopy cover. The UAVs were demonstrated to be a potentially effective tool for anti-poaching patrol and interdiction, in part, because of their ability to spot poachers. The pursuit of integrating the UAV into current anti-poaching patrol and interdiction efforts in arid savanna landscapes is strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease with endemic foci in Cameroon. Epidemiological data on schistosomiasis in pregnancy are scarce in the country. This study is about schistosomiasis among pregnant women in the Njombe-Penja health district, where schistosomiasis was reported since 1969.\\n\\nMethodologyOverall, 282 pregnant women were enrolled upon informed consent at first antenatal consultation. A questionnaire was administered to document socio-economic and obstetric information. Stool and terminal urine samples were collected and analysed using the Kato-Katz/formol-ether concentration techniques and centrifugation method respectively. Haemoglobin concentration was measured with finger prick blood, using a URIT-12(R) electronic haemoglobinometer.\\n\\nPrincipal findingsThe overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 31.91%. Schistosoma guineensis, S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections were found in 0.35%, 04.96% and 28.01% of participants respectively. Co-infection with 2 species of Schistosoma was found in 04.44% of these women. The prevalence of schistosomiasis was significantly higher in younger women ([&le;]20) and among residents of Njombe. All S. haematobium infected women were anemic and infection was associated with significantly lower haemoglobin levels (p=0.02).\\n\\nConclusionThe prevalence of schistosomiasis is high in pregnant women of the Njombe-Penja health district, with possible adverse pregnancy outcomes. Female of childbearing age should be considered for mass drug administration.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPregnant women are known to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases and in their case, at least two lives are at risk. Although schistosomiasis remains a major public health issue in Cameroon, epidemiological data on schistosomiasis in pregnancy are scarce. These data are of high interest for informed decision-making. We examined stools and urines from 282 women of the Njombe-Penja Health district and measured their blood levels. Overall, 31.91% of women were infected, mostly younger ones and those living in the town of Njombe. Three species of Schistosoma parasite were identified. Women having urinary schistosomiasis had lower blood levels. These results show that the prevalence of schistosomiasis is high in pregnant women of Njombe. Also, because of the anemia it induces, the disease can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes on the woman and her foetus. Treating female of childbearing age would cure the disease and prevent adverse outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the regulation of development can help elucidate the pathogenesis behind many developmental defects found in humans and other vertebrates. Evidence has shown that alternative splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a role in developmental regulation, but our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing are inadequate. Notably, a subset of small noncoding RNAs known as scaRNAs (small cajal body associated RNAs) contribute to spliceosome maturation and function through covalently modifying spliceosomal RNAs by either methylating or pseudouridylating specific nucleotides, but the developmental significance of these modifications is not well understood. Our focus is on one such scaRNA, known as SNORD94 or U94, that methylates one specific cytosine (C62) on spliceosomal RNA U6, thus potentially altering spliceosome function during embryogenesis. We previously showed that mRNA splicing is significantly different in myocardium from infants with congenital heart defects (CHD) compared to controls. Furthermore, we showed that modifying expression of scaRNAs alters mRNA splicing in human cells, and zebrafish embryos. Here we present evidence that SNORD94 levels directly influence levels of methylation at C62 in U6, which we have previously shown is associated with altered splicing and congenital heart defects. The potential importance of scaRNAs as a developmentally important regulatory mechanism controlling alternative splicing of mRNA is unappreciated and needs more research.\\n\\nAuthor summarySplicing of mRNA transcripts by removal of introns and some non-critical exons is a crucial part of mRNA processing, gene expression, and cell function, and regulation of this process is still under investigation. Alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts of genes is tissue and time specific throughout life, although this process occurs everywhere in the body according to local tissue needs and signals. The spliceosome, the large ribonucleoprotein complex that carries out splicing, is biochemically modified by small noncoding RNAs, which is important for its structure and function. Here we show that the amount of 2-O-ribose methylation at nucleotide C62 in spliceosomal RNA U6 is dependent on the level of the scaRNA SNORD94. We hypothesize that alternative splicing is dependent, at least in part, on biochemical modification to the spliceosomal RNAs. Furthermore, when scaRNA directed modifications are dysregulated, the result causes inappropriate alternative splicing that may contribute to developmental defects such as congenital heart defects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that 2-O-ribose methylation is indeed dependent on scaRNA levels in human cells and tissues.",

    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been the first-line standard of care for the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) since 2005. Though initially beneficial, TMZ- resistance is universal and second-line interventions are an unmet clinical need. Here we took advantage the mechanism of action of TMZ to target guanines (G) and investigated G-rich g- quadruplex (G4) and splice site changes that occur upon TMZ-resistance. We report TMZ-resistant GBM has guanine mutations that disrupt the G-rich DNA G4s and splice sites that lead to deregulated alternative splicing. These alterations create vulnerabilities, which are selectively targeted by either the G4 stabilizing drug TMPyP4 or a novel splicing kinase inhibitor of cdc2- like kinase. Finally, we show that the G4 and RNA-binding protein EWSR1 aggregates in the cytoplasm in TMZ-resistant GBM cells and patient samples. Together, our findings provide insight into targetable vulnerabilities of TMZ-resistant GBM and present cytoplasmic EWSR1 as a putative biomarker.\n\nTeaserTargeting temozolomide mutations in drug resistant glioma via g-quadruplex and splicing modulators with a putative biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are critical components of the BM microenvironment and play an essential role in supporting hematopoiesis. Dysfunction of MSCs is associated with the impaired BM microenvironment that promotes leukemia development. However, whether and how restoration of the impaired BM microenvironment can inhibit leukemia development remain unknown. Using an established leukemia model and the RNA-seq analysis, we discovered functional degeneration of MSCs during leukemia progression. Importantly, intra-BM instead of systemic transfusion of donor healthy MSCs restored the BM microenvironment, thus systemically altering cytokine expression patterns, improving normal hematopoiesis, reducing tumor burden, and ultimately prolonging survival of the leukemia-bearing mice. Donor MSC treatment restored the function of host MSCs and reprogrammed host macrophages to fulfill tissue-repair function. Transfusion of MSC-reprogrammed macrophages largely recapitulated the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Further, we found that donor MSCs reprogrammed macrophages to reduce leukemia burden through autocrine of IL-6. Taken together, our study reveals that donor MSCs reprogram host macrophages to restore the BM microenvironment and inhibit leukemia development, thus offering rationales for local MSC administration as a potentially effective therapy for leukemia.\\n\\nKey PointsKey Point 1: Intra-BM transfusion of MSCs restores the BM microenvironment, improves thrombopoiesis, and suppresses MDS/MPN initiated by Nras mutation.\\n\\nKey Point 2: Donor MSCs reprogram macrophages to restore the BM microenvironment, improve thrombopoiesis, and suppress leukemia.",

ER-phagy can occur by macroautophagic and microautophagic mechanisms. While dedicated machinery for macro-ER-phagy has been discovered, the molecules and mechanisms mediating micro-ER-phagy remain unknown. Here, we first show that micro-ER-phagy in yeast involves the conversion of stacked cisternal ER into multilamellar ER whorls during microautophagic uptake into lysosomes. Second, we identify the conserved Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase complex and ESCRT proteins as key components for micro-ER-phagy. Third, we demonstrate that macro- and micro-ER-phagy are parallel pathways with distinct molecular requirements. Finally, we provide evidence that ESCRT proteins directly function in scission of the lysosomal membrane to complete the microautophagic uptake of ER. These findings establish a framework for a mechanistic understanding of micro-ER-phagy and, thus, a comprehensive appreciation of the role of autophagy in ER homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is conserved across eukaryotes yet varies in the details of its execution. Here we describe a new comparative model system for molecular analysis of meiosis, the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, a distant relative of the widely studied model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. P. pacificus shares many anatomical and other features that facilitate analysis of meiosis in C. elegans. However, while C. elegans has lost the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and evolved a recombination-independent mechanism to synapse its chromosomes, P. pacificus expresses both DMC-1 and RAD-51. We find that SPO-11 and DMC-1 are required for stable homolog pairing, synapsis, and crossover formation, while RAD-51 is dispensable for these key meiotic processes. RAD-51 and DMC-1 localize sequentially to chromosomes during meiotic prophase and show nonoverlapping functions. We also present a new genetic map for P. pacificus that reveals a crossover landscape very similar to that of C. elegans, despite marked divergence in the regulation of synapsis and crossing-over between these lineages.",

This cognitive robustness is thought to be enabled by transforming the varying input patterns into invariant representations of objects, but how this transformation occurs computationally remains unclear. Here we propose that sensory coding should follow a principle of maximal dependence capturing to encode associations among structural components that can uniquely identify objects. We show that a computational framework incorporating dimension expansion and a specific form of sparse coding can capture structures that contain maximum information about specific objects, allow redundancy coding, and enable consistent representation of object identities. Using symbol and face recognition, we demonstrate that a two-layer system can generate representations that remain invariant under conditions of occlusion, corruption, or high noise.",

To identify genes that control hypothalamic development, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to profile mouse hypothalamic gene expression across 12 developmental time points between embryonic day 10 and postnatal day 45. This identified genes that delineated clear developmental trajectories for all major hypothalamic cell types, and readily distinguished major regional subdivisions of the developing hypothalamus. By using our developmental dataset, we were able to rapidly annotate previously unidentified clusters from existing scRNA-Seq datasets collected during development, and to identify the developmental origins of major neuronal populations of the ventromedial hypothalamus. We further show that our approach can rapidly and comprehensively characterize mutants that have altered hypothalamic patterning, identifying Nkx2.1 as a negative regulator of prethalamic identity.
