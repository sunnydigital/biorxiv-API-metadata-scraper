    "abstract": "The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure volume relationship (ES; ESPVR) is the cornerstone of systolic LV function analysis. Recently, it became possible to measure 2D LV chamber shape during vena cava occlusion (VCO) with MRI. We used an improved level-set semi-automatic segmentation method (LSSM) to determine the effect of VCO on LV geometry, ES pressure area (PA) and ESPVR.\n\n10 healthy adult sheep were anesthetized. LV pressure transducer and inferior vena cava (IVC) balloon catheter were percutaneously inserted. Ferumoxytol (0.125 ml/kg iv; AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA) was given to enhance blood pool contrast. LV pressure and 2D retrospectively-gated cine MRI of LV cross sections 25 (Apex), 50 (Mid) and 75% (Base) of the distance from the apex to the base of the LV were obtained during separate IVC balloon inflations (VCO). LV pressure was digitally filtered and LV chamber segmented with the LSSM. Cross sectional area, major and minor axes, major axis orientation, ESPAR and ESPVR were calculated.\n\nThe LSSM had excellent reliability. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The orientation (angle) of each major axis relative to the anterior RV insertion shifted during VCO. However, the orientation remained toward the septum. There was chamber collapse (LV area < 0.25 cm2) at the apical level during VCO (7 cases). ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse.\n\nIn conclusion, MRI-based measurement of LV geometry, ESPAR and ESPVR during VCO is a valuable method that may lead to improved understanding of systolic LV function.\n\nNew and NoteworthyReal-time MRI was used to continuously measure the LV PA relationship as loading conditions were transiently varied in anesthetized sheep. All three examined cross-sections became more elliptical during VCO. The ESPAR were non-linear at all three cross-sections. Chamber collapse at the apical level during VCO resulted in a non-linear ESPVR. The heart contracted in a non-concentric manner during VCO which could inform modeling studies and elucidate mechanisms underlying LV adaptations to sudden load changes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWVariational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model from the computer vision community; it learns a latent representation of images and generates new images in an unsupervised way. Recently, Vanilla VAE has been applied to single-cell data analysis, in the hope of harnessing the representation power of latent space to evade the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\" of the original dataset. However, Vanilla VAE is suffering from the issue of less informative latent space, which raises a question concerning the reliability of Vanilla VAE latent space in representing the high-dimensional single-cell datasets. Therefore I set up such a study to examine this issue from the multiple perspectives.\\n\\nThis paper confirms the issue of Vanilla VAE by comparing it with MMD-VAE, a variant of VAE which has claimed to have overcome this issue based on image data, across a series of single-cell RNAseq and mass cytometry datasets. The result indicates that MMD-VAE is superior to Vanilla VAE in retaining the information not only in the latent space but also the reconstruction space, which suggests that MMD-VAE be a better option for single-cell data analysis than Vanilla VAE.",

    "abstract": "The advent of medical imaging and automatic image analysis is bringing the full quantitative assessment of lesions and tumor burden at every clinical examination within reach. This opens avenues for the development and testing of functional disease models, as well as their use in the clinical practice for personalized medicine. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian statistical framework, based on mixed-effects models, to quantitatively test and learn functional disease models at different scales, on population longitudinal data. We also derive an effective mathematical model for the crossover between initially detected lesions and tumor dissemination, based on the Iwata-Kawasaki-Shigesada model. We finally propose to leverage this descriptive disease progression model into model-aware biomarkers for personalized risk-assessment, taking all available examinations and relevant covariates into account. As a use case, we study Multiple Myeloma, a disseminated plasma cell cancer, in which proper diagnostics is essential, to differentiate frequent precursor state without end-organ damage from the rapidly developing disease requiring therapy. After learning the best biological models for local lesion growth and global tumor burden evolution on clinical data, and computing corresponding population priors, we use individual model parameters as biomarkers, and can study them systematically for correlation with external covariates, such as sex or location of the lesion. On our cohort of 63 patients with smoldering Multiple Myeloma, we show that they perform substantially better than other radiological criteria, to predict progression into symptomatic Multiple Myeloma. Our study paves the way for modeling disease progression patterns for Multiple Myeloma, but also for other metastatic and disseminated tumor growth processes, and for analyzing large longitudinal image data sets acquired in oncological imaging. It shows the unprecedented potential of model-based biomarkers for better and more personalized treatment decisions and deserves being validated on larger cohorts to establish its role in clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "DNA polymerase IV (pol IV) is expressed at increased levels in Escherichia coli cells suffering high levels of DNA damage. In a recent single-molecule imaging study, we demonstrated that elevating the pol IV concentration is not sufficient to provide access to binding sites on the nucleoid, suggesting that other factors may recruit pol IV to its substrates once the DNA becomes damaged. Here we extend this work, investigating the proteins UmuD and RecA as potential modulators of pol IV activity. UmuD promotes long-lived association of pol IV with the nucleoid, whereas its cleaved form, UmuD, which accumulates in DNA-damaged cells, inhibits binding. In agreement with proposed roles for pol IV in homologous recombination, up to 40% of pol IV foci colocalise with a probe for RecA* nucleoprotein filaments in ciprofloxacin-treated cells. A hyperactive RecA mutant, recA(E38K), allows pol IV to bind the nucleoid even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. In vitro, RecA(E38K) forms RecA*-like structures that can recruit pol IV, even on double-stranded DNA, consistent with a physical interaction between RecA and pol IV. Together, the results indicate that UmuD and RecA modulate the binding of pol IV to its DNA substrates, which frequently coincide with RecA* structures.",

    "abstract": "Activated myeloid cells and astrocytes are the predominant cell types in active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Both cell types can adopt diverse functional states that play critical roles in lesion formation and resolution. In order to identify phenotypic subsets of myeloid cells and astrocytes, we profiled acute MS lesions with thirteen glial activation markers using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a method for multiplexed labeling of histological sections. In a demyelinating lesion, we found multiple distinct myeloid and astrocyte phenotypes that populated separate lesion zones. In a post-demyelinating lesion, phenotypes were less distinct and more uniformly distributed. In both lesions cell-to-cell interactions were not random, but occurred between specific glial subpopulations and lymphocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that myeloid, but not astrocyte phenotypes were activated along a lesion rim-to-center gradient, and that marker expression in glial cells at the lesion rim was driven more by cell-extrinsic factors than in cells at the center. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that highly multiplexed tissue imaging, combined with the appropriate computational tools, is a powerful approach to study heterogeneity, spatial distribution and cellular interactions in the context of MS lesions. Identifying glial phenotypes and their interactions at different lesion stages may provide novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting acute demyelination and low-grade, chronic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHigh frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induces excitation when applied to the motor cortex as reflected by the increase MEP amplitudes after the stimulation. The effects differ according to pulse width, probably due to higher content of energy in the wider pulses and their ability to cause wider activation in comparison to shorter pulse shapes. Here we focus on the aftereffects generated with high frequency controllable pulse TMS (cTMS) with different pulse widths.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate the influence of pulse energy by using different stimulation intensities and pulse widths on the excitatory plastic aftereffects of high frequency (HF) rTMS.\n\nMethodsUsing a controllable pulse stimulator TMS (cTMS), we stimulated the hand motor cortex with 5 Hz rTMS applying 1200 bidirectional pulses with the main component widths of 80, 100 and 120 microseconds. 14 healthy subjects were initially investigated for six randomized sessions first with 80% RMT for anterior-posterior (AP) and posterior-anterior (PA). Then three more sessions using same pulse widths were added for 90% RMT anterior-posterior (AP).\n\nResults80% HF rTMS did not produce any significant excitation in either AP or PA direction. 90% RMT AP stimulation with 100 and 120 microsecond-wide pulses were more excitatory, when compared to the 80 microsecond-wide pulses. We also found a correlation between the individual pulse energy and the plastic outcome of each session.\n\nConclusionsHF rTMS with wider pulses is more effective in producing excitatory aftereffects, an effect that correlated with the higher energy content of wider pulses and higher intensity.\n\nSignificanceThe findings here suggest that wider pulses are capable of inducing more excitation, a fact that could contribute to better results in future clinical studies performed with wider pulses.",

    "abstract": "Accurate massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of genetic variants is key to many areas of science and medicine, such as cataloguing population genetic variation and diagnosing genetic diseases. Certain genomic positions can be prone to higher rates of systematic sequencing and alignment bias that limit accuracy, resulting in false positive variant calls. Current standard practices to differentiate between loci that can and cannot be sequenced with high confidence utilise consensus between different sequencing methods as a proxy for sequencing confidence. These practices have significant limitations and alternative methods are required to overcome these.\n\nWe have developed a novel statistical method based on summarising sequenced reads from whole genome clinical samples and cataloguing them in \"Incremental Databases\" that maintain individual confidentiality. Allele statistics were catalogued for each genomic position that consistently showed systematic biases with the corresponding MPS sequencing pipeline. We found systematic biases present at [~]1-3% of the human autosomal genome across five patient cohorts. We identified which genomic regions were more or less prone to systematic biases, including large homopolymer flanks (odds ratio=23.29-33.69) and the NIST high confidence genomic regions (odds ratio=0.154-0.191). We confirmed our predictions on a gold-standard reference genome and showed that these systematic biases can lead to suspect variant calls within clinical panels.\n\nOur results recommend increased caution to address systematic biases in whole genome sequencing and alignment.

    "abstract": "During cell culture, trypsin, a serine protease, is applied to cells for 5-10 minutes to separate them from each other and from the underlying substratum so that they can be transferred to a different vessel, for re-plating, after growth medium containing 10 % serum has been added to the cells, in a well-known technique known as  passaging. The serum in the growth medium contains alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is a potent inhibitor of trypsin, elastase and other serine proteases. Although what is used is bovine serum in which levels of proteins could be different from levels seen in humans, normal human serum contains A1AT (> 1 mg/ml; > [~]18 {micro}mol/L) as well as trypsin itself (< 460 ng/ml, or [~]0.02 {micro}mol/L), with the former in a [~]900-fold molar excess over the latter. Thus, it may be assumed there is also enough A1AT in the bovine serum added during passaging, to neutralize the trypsin ([~]100 M) present in the small volume of trypsin-EDTA solution used to separate cells. What are the consequences of not adding serum, when growth medium is added, or of maintaining cells for a few tens of hours in the presence of trypsin, in a serum-free growth medium? What does such sustained exposure to trypsin during cell culture do to cells? More generally, what are the responses of cells within an organism to the balance of trypsin and A1AT in the serum that bathes them constantly? We know that excesses and deficiencies in the levels of either trypsin or A1AT are associated with disease. We know that cellular metabolism can be influenced through signaling involving protease activated membrane GPCR receptors (PAR1-4). In particular, we know of a receptor called PAR2, which is specifically activated by trypsin, expressed by cells at baseline levels, and upregulated through some feedback involving trypsin-activation. We also know that cells at sites of injury or inflammation produce and secrete trypsin, and that this trypsin can act locally upon cells in a variety of ways, all of which have probably not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that sustained exposure to trypsin induces cells to de-differentiate into a stem-like state. We show that if serum is either not added at all, or added and then washed away (after confluency is attained), during cell culture, all cells exposed to exogenously-added trypsin undergo changes in morphology, transcriptome, secretome, and developmental potential, and transition into a state of stemness, in minimal essential medium (MEM). Regardless of their origins, i.e., independent of whether they are derived from primary cultures, cell lines or cancer cell lines, and regardless of the original cell type used, exposure to trypsin ([~]10 {micro}M; [~]250 {micro}g/ml) at a concentration 10-fold lower than that used to separate cells during passaging ([~]100 M), over a period of 24-48 hours, causes cells to (1) become rounded, (2) cluster together, (3) get arrested in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, (4) display increased presence of 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine in their nuclei (indicative of reprogramming), (5) display increased levels of activated PAR2 membrane receptor, (6) become capable of very efficient efflux of drug-mimicking dyes, (7) express factors and/or markers known to be associated with induction and/or attainment of stemness, with predominant expression of Sox-2 within cell nuclei; (8) display overall transcriptomic (RNASEQ) profiles characteristic of stemness; (9) secrete stemness-associated factors such as bFGF, and IL-1{beta}, into the medium, in quantities sufficient to support autocrine function (in certain cases); and (10) display increased conversion of pro-MMPs into activated MMPs in the cells secretome. Notably, (11) inclusion of differentiating and/or transdifferentiating factors in the environment of such cells causes them to express markers associated with ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal cell lineages and/or transdifferentiate into specific cell types, e.g., adipocytes or osteocytes.\\n\\nMost intriguingly of all, (12) the attained stemness appears to be reversible, i.e., withdrawal of trypsin from the medium prior to addition of any differentiating factors restores cells to their original morphology, also over a period of 24-48 hours. Further, (13) a known PAR2 agonist, and a known PAR2 antagonist, respectively, appear to mimic effects of trypsin addition and withdrawal/inhibition. In addition, (14) in experiments with a particular cancer characterized by high levels of stemness (TNBC; triple negative breast cancer), tissues of all TNBC patients express high levels of the PAR2 receptor, as do cells from a known TNBC-derived cell line. We propose that through their effects on PAR levels, and PAR activation status, the balance of trypsin and A1AT levels in organisms normally regulates cellular potential for differentiation, de-differentiation or transdifferentiation, in a local manner, with the default status being that A1AT inhibits trypsin and keeps cells differentiated, whereas sustained trypsin signaling at sites of injury through local production of trypsin helps to place cells into an intermediate state of stemness from which they can either return to their original differentiated state(s), or undergo factor-dependent differentiation, or transdifferentiation, into specific cell types or lineages. It is also possible that reduction in A1AT promotes regeneration. We present a core (RNASEQ-derived) signature for trypsin-induced stemness in human corneal fibroblasts (HCFs) and cells from a retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19), noting that there are commonalities as well as differences between them, which suggests that this core signature will be amended with RNASEQ studies of more trypsin-exposed cell types. Our findings offer a possible explanation for the recent unexplained increase in the preference for serum-free protocols used for induction and maintenance of stemness involving iPSCs and mesenchymal stem cells. Also, our studies suggest a new approach to understanding and exploiting how organisms might use stemness, in adults. Trypsin-dominated serine protease induced reprogramming (SPIR) might offer a more natural, and suitably  softer, method of reprogramming of cellular developmental potential for local regenerative requirements in animal tissues.",

To address this challenge, we developed a generalizable light modulated protein stabilization system (GLIMPSe) to control intracellular protein level independent of its functionality. We applied GLIMPSe to control two distinct classes of proteins: mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), a negative regulator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, as well as a constitutively active form of MEK (CA MEK), a positive regulator of the same pathway. Kinetics study showed that light-induced protein stabilization could be achieved within 1 minute of blue light stimulation. GLIMPSe enables target-independent optogenetic control of protein activities and therefore minimizes the systematic variation embedded within different photoactivatable proteins. Overall, GLIMPSe promises to achieve light-mediated post-translational stabilization of a wide array of target proteins in live cells.",

    "abstract": "The human Ska (spindle and kinetochore associated) complex is essential for proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Its loading onto the kinetochore complex Ndc80 (Ndc80C) plays a critical role in such function; however, the key determinant that docks Ska onto Ndc80C still remain elusive. Here, we address this question using biochemical reconstitution followed by functional analysis. We identified six Cdk1 sites in Ska3 distributed in three conserved regions. In vitro, Cdk1 phosphorylation on the Ska complex enhanced WT, not phospho-deficient 6A, binding to Ndc80C. Strikingly, the phospho-mimetic Ska 6D complex formed a stable macro-complex with Ndc80C, but Ska WT failed to do so, suggesting that Cdk1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the Ska-Ndc80 macro-complex. In cells, Ska3 6A completely lost its localization to kinetochores and its functions in chromosome segregation; whereas Ska3 6D partially restored them. Altogether, our findings not only for the first time reveal the key phospho-regulated Ska-Ndc80 macro-complex essential for faithful chromosome segregation, but also pave the way for mechanistic analyses of kinetochore-microtubule interactions.",

    "abstract": "Most of the variation in the human genome is a single nucleotide variation (SNV) based on a single base or small fragment insertions and deletions and genomic copy number variation (CNV). Both types of mutations are involved in many human diseases. Such diseases often have complex clinical symptoms and difficult clinical diagnosis, so an effective detection method is needed to help clinical diagnosis and prevent birth defects. With the development of sequencing technology, the method of chip capture combined with high-throughput sequencing has been extensively used because of its high throughput, high accuracy, high speed and low cost. This study designed a chip that captures the coding region of 3043 genes associated with 4013 monogenic diseases. In addition, 148 chromosomal abnormalities can be identified by setting targets in specific regions. Compared with the whole exon chip, the chip can detect 4013 monogenic diseases and 148 chromosomal abnormalities at a lower cost, including SNV, intra-gene CNV and genomic copy number variation. This study utilized a strategy of combining the BGISEQ500 sequencing platform with the chip to identify 102 disease-associated mutations in 63 patients, 69 of which were new mutations. The evaluation test results also show that this combination complies with the requirements of clinical testing and has good clinical application value.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large 286 kDa multi-domain protein whose mutation is a common cause of Parkinsons disease (PD). One of the common sites of familial PD-associated mutations occurs at residue Arg-1441 in the GTPase domain of LRRK2. Previously, we reported that the PD-associated mutation R1441H impairs the catalytic activity of the GTPase domain thereby traps it in a persistently \\\"on\\\" state. More recently, we reported that the GTPase domain of LRRK2 exists in a dynamic dimer-monomer equilibrium where GTP binding shifts it to the monomeric conformation while GDP binding shifts it back to the dimeric state. We also reported that all of the PD-associated mutations at Arg-1441, including R1441H, R1441C, and R1441G, impair the nucleotide-dependent dimer-monomer conformational dynamics of the GTPase domain. However, the mechanism of this nucleotide-dependent conformational dynamics and how it is impaired by the mutations at residue Arg-1441 remained unclear. Here, we report a 1.6 [A] crystal structure of the GTPase domain of LRRK2. Our structure has revealed a dynamic switch region that can be differentially regulated by GTP and GDP binding. This nucleotide-dependent regulation is impaired when residue Arg-1441 is substituted with the PD-associated mutations due to the loss of its exquisite interactions consisting of two hydrogen bonds and a {pi}-stacking interaction at the dimer interface.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMutations in LRRK2 are associated with familial Parkinsons disease, so understanding its mechanism of actions and how they are changed by the disease-associated mutations is important for developing therapeutic strategies. This paper describes an atomic structure of the G-domain of LRRK2 revealing that the conformational dynamics of the switch regions are potentially important for its normal function. It further shows that a disease-associated mutation could lock the G domain in a persistently active-like conformation, thus perturbing its normal function.",

    "abstract": "The dynamical interaction between a growing cancer population and the adaptive immune system generates diverse evolutionary trajectories which ultimately result in tumor clearance or immune escape. Here, we create a simple mathematical model coupling T-cell recognition with an evolving cancer population which may randomly produce evasive subclones, imparting transient protection against the effector T-cells. We demonstrate that T-cell turnover declines and evasion rates together explain differential probabilities in early incidence data for almost all cancer types. Fitting the model to TRACERx evolutionary data argues in favor of substantial and sustained immune pressure exerted on a developing tumor, suggesting that measured incidence is a small proportion of all cancer initiation events. Most generally, dynamical models promise to increase our quantitative understanding of many immune escape contexts, with applications to cancer and intracellular pathogenic infections.",

Monocular contrast sensitivity, uncrowded and crowded visual acuity were measured before, during, 5 minutes and 30 minutes post stimulation on each day.\n\nResultsActive tRNS significantly improved contrast sensitivity and uncrowded visual acuity for both amblyopic and fellow eyes whereas sham stimulation had no effect. An analysis of the day by day effects revealed large within session improvements on day 1 for the active group that waned across subsequent days. No long-lasting (multi-day) improvements were observed for contrast sensitivity, however a long-lasting improvement in amblyopic eye uncrowded visual acuity was observed for the active group. This improvement remained at 28 day follow up. However, between-group differences in baseline uncrowded visual acuity complicate the interpretation of this effect. No effect of tRNS was observed for amblyopic eye crowded visual acuity.\n\nConclusionsIn agreement with previous non-invasive brain stimulation studies using different techniques, tRNS induced short-term contrast sensitivity improvements in adult amblyopic eyes, however, multiple sessions of tRNS did not lead to enhanced or long-lasting effects for the majority of outcome measures.",

There is significant potential in the use of computational modelling techniques to predict individual patient responses and thus provide more personalized treatment. Deep learning is a promising computational technique that can be used for differential treatment selection based on predicted remission probability.\\n\\nMethodsUsing STAR*D and CO-MED trial data, we employed deep neural networks to predict remission after feature selection. Differential treatment benefit was estimated in terms of improvement of population remission rates after application of the model for treatment selection using both naive and conservative approaches. The naive approach assessed population remission rate in five sets of 200 patients held apart from the training set; the conservative approach used bootstrapping for sample generation and focused on population remission rate for patients who actually received the drug predicted by the model compared to the general population.\\n\\nResultsOur deep learning model predicted remission in a pooled CO-MED/STAR*D dataset (including four treatments) with an AUC of 0.69 using 17 input features. Our naive analysis showed an improvement of remission of over 30% (from a 34.33% population remission rate to 46.12%). Our conservative analysis showed a 7.2% improvement in population remission rate (p= 0.01, C.I. 2.48% {+/-} .5%).\\n\\nConclusionOur model serves as proof-of-concept that deep learning has utility in differential prediction of antidepressant response when selecting from a number of treatment options.

Work over the last 15 years has shown that plasma membrane lipid composition is close to a critical point of phase separation, with evidence that cells adapt their composition in ways that alter the proximity to this thermodynamical point. Macrophage cells are a key component of the innate immune system, responsive to infections, regulating the local state of inflammation. We investigate changes in the plasma membranes proximity to the critical point, as a response to stimulation by various pro- and anti-inflammatory agents. Pro-inflammatory (IFN-{gamma}, Kdo-LipidA, LPS) perturbations induce an increase in the transition temperature of the GMPVs; anti-inflammatory IL4 has the opposite effect. These changes recapitulate complex plasma membrane composition changes, and are consistent with lipid criticality playing a master regulatory role: being closer to critical conditions increases membrane protein activity.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR homing gene drives potentially have the capacity for large-scale population modification or suppression. However, resistance alleles formed by the drives can prevent them from successfully spreading. Such alleles have been found to form at high rates in most studies, including those in both insects and mammals. One possible solution to this issue is the use of multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs), thus allowing cleavage by the drive even if resistance sequences are present at some of the gRNA target sequences. Here, we develop a high-fidelity model incorporating several factors affecting the performance of drives with multiple gRNAs, including timing of cleavage, reduction in homology-directed repair efficiency due to imperfect homology around the cleavage site, Cas9 activity saturation, variance in the activity level of individual gRNAs, and formation of resistance alleles due to incomplete homology-directed repair. We parameterize the model using data from homing drive experiments designed to investigate these factors and then use it to analyze several types of homing gene drives. We find that each type of drive has an optimal number of gRNAs, usually between two and eight, dependent on drive type and performance parameters. Our model indicates that utilization of multiple gRNAs is insufficient for construction of successful gene drives, but that it provides a critical boost to drive efficiency when combined with other strategies for population modification or suppression.",

    "abstract": "Community productivity often correlates with diversity. In the microbial world this phenomenon can sometimes be explained by highly-specific metabolic interactions that include cross-feeding and syntrophy. Such interactions help account for the astonishing variety of microbial life, and drive many of the biogeochemical cycles without which life as we know it could not exist. While it is difficult to recapitulate experimentally how these interactions evolved among multiple taxa, we can explore in the laboratory how they arise within one. These experiments provide insight into how different bacterial ecotypes evolve and from these, possibly new  species. We have previously shown that in a simple, constant environment a single clone of E. coli can give rise to a consortium of genetically-and physiologically-differentiated strains, in effect, a set of ecotypes, that coexist by cross-feeding. We marked these different ecotypes and their shared ancestor by integrating fluorescent protein into their genomes. We then used flow cytometry to show that each strain by itself is more fit than the shared ancestor, that pairs of evolved strains are fitter still, and that the entire consortium is fittest of all. We further demonstrate that the rank order of fitness values agrees with estimates of yield, indicating that an experimentally evolved consortium more efficiently converts resources to offspring than its ancestor or any member acting in isolation.\\n\\nImportanceIn the microbial world, diversity and productivity of communities and consortia often correlate positively. However, it is challenging to tease apart a consortium whose members have co-evolved, and connect estimates of their fitness and the fitness of their ancestor(s) with estimates of productivity. Such analyses are prerequisite to understanding the evolutionary origins of all biological communities. Here we dissect an E. coli consortium that evolved in the laboratory and show that cooperative interactions are favored under continuous glucose limitation because a partnership of ecotypes is better able to scavenge all available resources and more efficiently convert those resources to offspring than any single individual. Such interactions may be a prelude to a special form of syntrophy, and are likely to be key determinants of microbial community structure in nature, including those having clinical significance, such as chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "While drug resistant mutations in HIV-1 is largely credited to its error prone HIV-1 RT, host proteins such as deaminases may also play a role generating mutations. Many HIV-1 RT mutational in vitro studies utilize reporter genes (LacZ) as template, leaving out the possible contribution of HIV codon usage and gene-specific effects. To address this gap, we studied HIV-1 RT mutation rates and bias on its own Gag, protease, and RT p66 genes in an in-vitro selection pressure free system. We found rare clinical mutations with a general avoidance of crucial functional sites in the background mutations rates for Gag, protease and RT p66 at 4.71 x 10-5, 6.03 x 10-5, and 7.09 x 10-5 mutations/bp respectively. Gag and p66 genes showed a large number of  A to G hypermutations likely due to cellular adenosine deaminases. Comparisons with silently mutated p66 sequences showed an increase in mutation rates (1.88 x 10-4 mutations/bp) and that  A to G mutations occurred in regions reminiscent of ADAR neighbour preferences. Mutational free energies by the  A to G mutations revealed an avoidance of destabilizing effects with the natural p66 gene codon usage providing barriers to ADAR effects. Our study demonstrates the importance of studying mutation emergence in HIV genes to understand how fast drug resistance can emerge, sometimes with contributions of host deaminases, providing transferable applications to how new viral diseases and drug resistances can emerge.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial symbionts that manipulate the reproduction of their hosts are important factors in invertebrate ecology and evolution. Studying the genomic and phenotypic diversity of reproductive manipulators can improve efforts to control infectious diseases and contribute to our understanding of host-symbiont evolution. Despite the vast genomic and phenotypic diversity of reproductive manipulators, only a handful of strains are used as biological control agents because little is known about the broad scale infection frequencies and densities of these bacteria in nature. Here we develop a data mining approach to quantify the number of arthropod and nematode host species infected with Wolbachia and other reproductive manipulators such as Rickettsia and Spiroplasma. Across the entire Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, we found reproductive manipulators infected 2,083 arthropod and 119 nematode samples, representing 240 and 8 species, respectively. After accounting for sampling and infection frequency differences among species, we estimated that Wolbachia infects approximately 44% of all arthropod species and 34% of all nematode species. In contrast, we estimated other reproductive manipulators infect 1-8% of arthropod and nematode species. Next, we explored another important biological parameter: the relative bacterial density, or titer, within hosts. We found variation in titer within and between arthropod species to be large, and that host species explains approximately 36% of variation in titer across our dataset. This suggests bacterial strain and/or host species plays a role in shaping bacterial densities within and between host species. By leveraging the model system Drosophila melanogaster, we also found a number of host SNPs associated with titer in genes potentially relevant to host interactions with Wolbachia, suggesting bacterial induced host genome evolution. Our study demonstrates that data mining is a powerful tool to understand host-symbiont co-evolution and opens an array of previously inaccessible questions for further analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bone mass loss contributes to the risk of bone fracture in the elderly. Many factors including age, obesity, estrogen and diet, are associated with bone mass loss. Mice studies suggest that the intestinal microbiome might influence the bone mass by regulating the immune system, however there has been little evidence from human studies.\n\nWe have recruited 361 Chinese elderly women to collect data for a metagenomic-wide association study (MWAS) to investigate the influence of the gut microbiome on bone health. Gut microbiome data were produced using BGISEQ500 sequencing, BMD was calculated using Hologic dual energy X-ray machine, BMI (Body Mass Index) and age were also provided. This therefore data allows exploration of gut microbiome diversity and links to bone mass loss, as well as microbial species and modules as markers for bone mineral density. Making these data potentially useful in studying the role the gut microbiota might play in bone mass loss and offering exploration into the bone mass loss process.",

    "abstract": "Membrane vesicles (MVs) serve as a vital source of virulence factors in many pathogenic organisms. The release of MVs by Listeria monocytogenes is only recently recognized, but its role in the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of MVs of L. monocytogenes in virulence and host interactions. Proteomic analyses of whole cells and MVs of L. monocytogenes were performed using LC/MS/MS. A total of 1376 and 456 proteins were identified in the L. monocytogenes cells and MVs, respectively. Also, we have found that MVs contains active pore-forming listeriolysin (LLO), internalin B (inlB), phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC-A). We have previously reported that MVs of L. monocytogenes can infect and induce cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cells. In this study, we report the transcriptome response of Caco-2 cells upon infection with MVs as well as L. monocytogenes. In particular, we observed the up-regulation of autophagy-related genes in the early phase of infection with MVs. Transcription of inflammatory cytokines (CCL2, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL15, CXCL5, CXCL10) peaked at four h of infection. A large number of differentially expressed genes was associated with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, autophagy, cell cycle arrest, and induction of oxidative stress. At a later time point, transcriptional programs generated upon infection with MVs point toward to evade innate immune signals, by modulating the expression of anti-inflammatory genes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that MVs induce several signaling pathways such as PI3k-Akt signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, TNF, and NF-kB signaling pathway. Moreover, MVs induced the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes, which may result in the ability to prolong host cell survival, thus protecting the replicative niche for L. monocytogenes. Notably, we identified several non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are regulated during infection, suggesting that an early manipulation of the host gene expression may be essential for L. monocytogenes persistence and replication in host cells.",

Many studies have focused on T central memory (TCM) cells, while the existence and functional significance of T follicular helper (TFH) memory cells is controversial. Here we show that TFH memory cells are highly susceptible to NAD induced cell death (NICD) during isolation from tissues, leading to their under-representation in prior studies. NICD blockade reveals the persistence of abundant TFH memory cells, with high expression of hallmark TFH markers, that persist to at least 400 days after infection, by which time TCM cells are no longer found. Using single cell RNA-seq we demonstrate that TFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells, maintain stemness and self-renewal gene expression, and, in contrast to TCM cells, are multipotent following recall. Surprisingly, TFH memory cells concurrently express a distinct glycolytic signature similar to trained immune cells, including elevated expression of mTOR, HIF-1 and cAMP regulated genes. Late disruption of glycolysis/ICOS signaling leads to TFH memory cell depletion concomitant with decreased splenic plasma cells and circulating antibody titers, demonstrating both unique homeostatic regulation of memory TFH and their sustained function during the memory phase of the immune response. These results highlight the metabolic heterogeneity underlying distinct memory T cell subsets and establish TFH memory cells as an attractive target for the induction of long-lived adaptive immunity.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICell death during isolation from the tissue prevents the full recovery of TFH memory cells\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells and maintain a broader recall capacity\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells are maintained in the absence of antigen but require ICOS signaling and glycolysis\\nC_LIO_LITFH memory cells support late phase antibody production by splenic plasma cells\\nC_LI",

The transduction and processing of these vibrations mediates the ability to discern fine surface features. In the present study, we seek to characterize the effect of changes in scanning speed on texture-elicited vibrations to better understand how the exploratory strategy shapes the neuronal representation of texture. To this end, we scanned a variety of textures across the fingertip of human participants at a variety of speeds (10 - 160 mm/s) while measuring the resulting vibrations using a laser Doppler vibrometer. We found that increases in speed led to systematic increases in vibratory intensity and to a systematic upward multiplicative shift in the frequency composition of the vibrations. Furthermore, we showed that the upward shift in frequency composition accounts for the increase in intensity. The enhancement of higher frequency components accounts for the observed increase in the firing rates of nerve fibers, particularly Pacinian corpuscle-associated fibers, which are most sensitive at the high frequencies.",

We utilized in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging in awake mice expressing GCaMP6s in GABAergic or non-GABAergic neurons in the IC to investigate their spatial organization. We found different classes of temporal response, which we confirmed with simultaneous juxtacellular electrophysiology. Both GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons showed spatial microheterogeneity in their temporal responses. In contrast, a robust reversed rostromedial-caudolateral gradient of frequency tuning was conserved between the two groups, and even among the subclasses. This, together with the existence of a subset of neurons sensitive to spontaneous movements, provides functional evidence for redefining the border between DCIC and LCIC.",

A survey was implemented online and on site in two genetic diagnostic centres. Nearly half of the participants or their close family members had undergone genetic testing. Doctors constituted the only profession group that people trusted for the privacy of their health and genetic data; however, people chose to limit even their doctors access to their genetic/health records. The majority of the respondents preferred to keep full access for themselves. Several participants had negative experience or preconceptions about electronic health records: the medical reports of 9.7% of the respondents had been used or released without their consent, 15.1% stated that they avoided being tested due to violation risks, and 3.5% asked their doctors to enter a less embarrassing health status in their records. The participants wanted to see some regulations and security measurements before using any system for their health/genetic data. In addition, significantly more participants stating that storing genetic data in a mobile system was riskier compared to other health data.

During an immune response, DCs undergo a maturation process that optimizes their ability to efficiently prime naive T cells. Using atomic force microscopy, we find that during maturation, DC cortical stiffness increases via process that involves actin polymerization. Using stimulatory hydrogels and DCs expressing mutant cytoskeletal proteins, we find that increasing stiffness lowers the agonist dose needed for T cell activation. CD4+ T cells exhibit much more profound stiffness-dependency than CD8+ T cells. Finally, stiffness responses are most robust when T cells are stimulated with pMHC rather than anti-CD3{varepsilon}, consistent with a mechanosensing mechanism involving receptor deformation. Taken together, our data reveal that maturation-associated cytoskeletal changes alter the biophysical properties of DCs, providing mechanical cues that costimulate T cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Promastigotes of Leishmania infantum undergo a series of extracellular developmental stages inside the natural sand fly vector Lutzomyia longipalpis to reach the infectious stage, the metacyclic promastigote. There is limited information regarding the expression profile of L. infantum developmental stages inside the sand fly vector, and molecular markers that can distinguish the different parasite stages are lacking. We performed RNAseq on unaltered midguts of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis after infection with L. infantum parasites. RNAseq was carried out at various time points throughout parasite development. Principal component analysis mapped the sequences corresponding to the procyclic, nectomonad, leptomonad or metacyclic promastigote stage into distinct positions, with the procyclic stage being the most divergent population. Transcriptional levels across genes varied on average between 10- to 100-fold. Comparison between procyclic and nectomonad promastigotes resulted in 836 differentially expressed (DE) genes; between nectomonad and leptomonad promastigotes in 113 DE genes; and between leptomonad and metacyclic promastigotes in 302 DE genes. Most of the DE genes do not overlap across stages, highlighting the uniqueness of each stage. Furthermore, the different stages of Leishmania parasites exhibited specific transcriptional enrichment across chromosomes. Using the transcriptional signatures exhibited by distinct Leishmania stages during their development in the sand fly midgut, we determined the genes predominantly enriched in each stage, identifying multiple stage-specific markers for L. Infantum. Leading stage-specific marker candidates include genes encoding a zinc transporter in procyclics, a beta-fructofuranidase in nectomonads, a surface antigen-like protein in leptomonads, and an amastin-like surface protein in metacyclics. Overall, these findings demonstrate the transcriptional plasticity of the Leishmania parasite inside the sand fly vector and provide a repertoire of stage-specific markers for further development as molecular tools for epidemiological studies.",

There is, however, a lack of methods decomposing brain electrophysiological data into interacting components. Here, we propose a novel framework for detecting such interactions in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which we refer to as Nonlinear Interaction Decomposition (NID). In contrast to all previous methods for separation of cross-frequency (CF) sources in the brain, we propose that the extraction of nonlinearly interacting oscillations can be based on the statistical properties of their linear mixtures. The main idea of NID is that nonlinearly coupled brain oscillations can be mixed in such a way that the resulting linear mixture has a non-Gaussian distribution. We evaluate this argument analytically for amplitude-modulated narrow-band oscillations which are either phase-phase or amplitude-amplitude CF coupled. We validated NID extensively with simulated EEG obtained with realistic head modeling. The method extracted nonlinearly interacting components reliably even at SNRs as small as -15 (dB). Additionally, we applied NID to the resting-state EEG of 81 subjects to characterize CF phase-phase coupling between alpha and beta oscillations. The extracted sources were located in temporal, parietal and frontal areas, demonstrating the existence of diverse local and distant nonlinear interactions in resting-state EEG data.",

    "abstract": "Tissue remodeling during embryogenesis is driven by the apical contractility of the epithelial cell cortex. This behavior arises notably from Rho1/Rok induced transient accumulation of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII pulses) pulling on actin filaments (F-Actin) of the medio-apical cortex. While recent studies begin to highlight the mechanisms governing the emergence of Rho1/Rok/MyoII pulsatility in different organisms, little is known about how the F-Actin organization influences this process. Focusing on Drosophila ectodermal cells during germband extension and amnioserosa cells during dorsal closure, we show that the medio-apical actomyosin cortex consists of two entangled F-Actin subpopulations. One exhibits pulsatile dynamics of actin polymerization in a Rho1 dependent manner. The other forms a persistent and homogeneous network independent of Rho1. We identify the Frl/Fmnl formin as a critical nucleator of the persistent network since modulating its level, in mutants or by overexpression, decreases or increases the network density. Absence of this network yields sparse connectivity affecting the homogeneous force transmission to the cell boundaries. This reduces the propagation range of contractile forces and results in tissue scale morphogenetic defects. Our work sheds new lights on how the F-Actin cortex offers multiple levels of regulation to affect epithelial cells dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a hereditary disease characterized by cardiac hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction. Gene mutations causing HCM have been found in about half of the patients, while the genetic etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown for many cases of HCM. To identify novel mechanisms underlying HCM pathogenesis, we generated a cardiovascular-mutant medaka fish non-spring heart (nsh), which showed diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophic myocardium. The nsh homozygotes had fewer myofibrils, disrupted sarcomeres and expressed pathologically stiffer titin isoforms. In addition, the nsh heterozygotes showed M-line disassembly that is similar to the pathological changes found in HCM. Positional cloning revealed a missense mutation in an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain located in the M-line-A-band transition zone of titin. Screening of mutations in 96 unrelated patients with familial HCM, who had no previously implicated mutations in known sarcomeric gene candidates, identified two mutations in Ig domains close to the M-line region of titin. In vitro studies revealed that the mutations found in both medaka fish and in familial HCM increased binding of titin to muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MURF1) and enhanced titin degradation by ubiquitination. These findings implicate an impaired interaction between titin and MURF1 as a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HCM.",

MIR300 anti-proliferative and PP2A-activating functions are differentially activated through dose-dependent CCND2/CDK6 and SET inhibition, respectively. LSCs escape PP2A-mediated apoptosis through TUG1 lncRNA that uncouples and limits MIR300 functions to cytostasis by regulating unbound-MIR300 levels. Halting MIR300 homeostasis restores NK cell activity and suppresses leukemic but not normal hematopoiesis by eradicating nearly all LSCs.

    "abstract": "Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and KIR-ligand (KIRL) interactions play an important role in natural killer (NK) cell mediated graft versus leukemia effect following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the KIR gene and KIRL content in individuals, making it difficult to estimate the full clinical impact of NK cell reconstitution following HCT. Herein a novel mathematical model designed to quantify these interactions is presented to better assess the influence of NK cell-mediated alloreactivity on transplant outcomes. Ninety-eight HLA matched unrelated donor (URD) HCT recipients were retrospectively studied. The KIR-KIRL interactions were quantified using a system of matrix equations. Unit values were ascribed to each KIR-KIRL interaction and directionality of interactions was denoted by, either a positive (activating) or negative symbol (inhibition); these interactions were then summed. The absolute values of both the missing KIRL as well as inhibitory KIR-KIRL interactions were significantly associated with overall survival and relapse. These score components were initially used to develop a weighted (w-KIR Score) and subsequently a simplified, non-weighted KIR-KIRL interaction scores (IM-KIR Score). Increased w-KIR Score and IM-KIR Score were both predictive of all-cause mortality and relapse; w-KIR score HR of 0.37 (P=0.001) and 0.44 (P=0.044) respectively; IM-KIR score HR of 0.5 (P=0.049) and 0.44 (P=0.002) respectively.

Few hosts have a large number of parasites while most hosts have a low number of parasites. Phenomenological models of host-parasite systems thus use the negative-binomial distribution. However, to infer the mechanisms of aggregation, a mechanistic model that does not make any a priori assumptions is essential. Here we formulate a mechanistic model of parasite aggregation in hosts without assuming a negative-binomial distribution. Our results show that a simple model of parasite accumulation still results in an aggregated pattern, as shown by the derived mean and variance of the parasite distribution. By incorporating the derived statistics in host-parasite interactions, we can predict how aggregation affects the population dynamics of the hosts and parasites through time. Thus, our results can directly be applied to observed data as well as can inform the designing of statistical sampling procedures. Overall, we have shown how a plausible mechanistic process can result in the often observed phenomenon of parasite aggregation occurring in numerous ecological scenarios, thus providing a basis for a \"law\" of ecology.",

    "abstract": "SOX2 is a prominent member of the SOX family of transcription factors that has many different functional roles. This pleiotropy is made possible by multiple regulatory mechanisms that direct appropriate spatial and temporal patterns of expression, and therefore action. The current study concerns the mechanisms that determine Sox2 gene expression in the adult mammalian brain, where SOX2 protein is absent in general, but is selectively and abundantly expressed in a majority of neurons within a ventral diencephalic brain structure, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In this study, a comparative bioinformatic and biochemical analysis of different adult rat brain regions was conducted in order to identify SCN-selective (immaturity-related) regulatory mechanisms. The approach incorporated an integrated analysis of Sox2 enhancers, CTCF binding sites, and also expression of the Sox2-overlapping, long non-coding (lnc)RNA, Sox2ot. Initial experiments revealed brain region-specific Sox2ot expression (including region-specific novel transcripts), indicating a significant diversity of Sox2ot expression across the adult brain. However, the pattern and abundance of Sox2ot expression in the SCN, relative to selected control areas of the brain, did not indicate an overt relationship to Sox2 gene expression. Furthermore, although multiple individual Sox2ot exon sequences were shown to overlap annotated Sox2 gene enhancers at different sites across the Sox2 locus, again there was no indication of a SCN-specific functional correlation. Further integration with an analysis of selectively-active CTCF sites within the Sox2 locus directed attention to one site with both a prominent peak of activity in immature brain, and proximity to a functionally-characterized, ventral diencephalic, Sox2 enhancer termed U6 (upstream enhancer 6). Ex vivo analysis of the U6-associated CTCF site revealed SCN-selective CTCF binding, and these sequences were both localized within a known (brain region-selective) super-enhancer. Bioinformatic analysis of the U6 enhancer sequence revealed an abundance of consensus sites for the SCN-selective transcription factor LHX1, and over-expression of this factor enhanced the activity of cloned U6 sequence in transfected cells. However, despite this compelling evidence for a molecular mechanism that underlies adult brain expression of SOX2, further analysis of LHX1-SOX2 co-expression in the SCN confounded this view, indicating the presence of other concurrent mechanisms in the different cell populations of the SCN.",

    "abstract": "The fast accumulation of high-throughput gene expression data provides us an unprecedented opportunity to understand the gene interactions and prioritize disease candidate genes. However, these data are typically noisy and highly heterogeneous, complicating their use in constructing large expression compendium. Recent studies suggest that the collective expression pattern can be better modeled by Gaussian mixtures. This motivates our present work, which applies a Multimodal framework (MMF) to depict the gene expression profiles. MMF introduces two new statistics: Multimodal Mutual Information and Multimodal Direct Information. Through extensive simulations, MMF outperforms other approaches for detecting gene co-expressions or gene regulatory interactions, regardless of the level of noise or strength of interactions. In the principal component analysis for very large collections of expression data, the use of MMI enables more biologically meaningful spaces to be extracted than the use of Pearson correlation. The practical use of MMF is further demonstrated with three biological applications: 1. Prioritizing KIF1A as the candidate causal gene of hereditary spastic paraparesis from familial exome sequencing data; 2. Detecting ANK2 as the  hot genes for autism spectrum disorders, derived from exome sequencing family based study; 3.

Profitable cultivation of the crop is hindered by various factors and one of the approaches for genetic improvement of the crop belonging to a monotypic genus is to exploit biotechnological tools. The major limitation for successful exploitation of biotechnological tools is the in vitro recalcitrance of castor tissues. Response of castor tissues to in vitro culture is poor which necessitated study on understanding the molecular basis of organogenesis in cultured tissues of castor, through de novo transcriptome analysis, by comparing with two other crops (jatropha and sunflower) with good regeneration ability.\\n\\nResultsRNA-seq analysis was carried out with hypocotyl explants from castor, jatropha and cotyledons from sunflower cultured on MS media supplemented with different concentrations of hormones. Genes that showed strong differential expression analysis during dedifferentiation and organogenic differentiation stages of callus included components of auxin and cytokinin signaling, secondary metabolite synthesis, genes encoding transcription factors, receptor kinases and protein kinases. In castor, many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and homeostasis like WAT1 (Wall associated thinness), vacuolar transporter genes, transcription factors like short root like protein were down-regulated while genes like DELLA were upregulated accounting for regeneration recalcitrance. Validation of 62 differentially expressed genes through qRT-PCR showed a consensus of 77.4% with the RNA-Seq analysis.\\n\\nConclusionThis study provides information on the set of genes involved in the process of organogenesis in three oilseed crops which forms a basis for understanding and improving the efficiency of plant regeneration and genetic transformation in castor.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, massively parallel sequencing approaches identified hundreds of mutated genes in cancer(1) providing an unprecedented amount of information about mechanisms of cancer cell maintenance and progression. However, while (it is widely accepted that) transformation processes result from oncogenic cooperation between deregulated genes and pathways, the functional characterization of candidate key players is mostly performed at the single gene level which is generally inadequate to identify these oncogene circuitries. In addition, studies aimed at depicting oncogenic cooperation involve the generation of challenging mouse models or the deployment of tedious screening pipelines. Genome wide mapping of epigenomic modifications on histone tails or binding of factors such as MED1 and BRD4 allowed identification of clusters of regulatory elements, also termed Super-Enhancers (SE)(2). Functional annotation of these regions revealed their high relevance during normal tissue development and cancer ontogeny(3). An interesting paradigm of the tumorigenic function of these SE regions comes from ETO2-GLIS2-driven acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) in which the fusion protein ETO2-GLIS2 is sufficient to promote an aberrant transcriptional network by the rewiring of SE regions(4). We thus hypothesized that important regulatory regions could control simultaneously expression of genes cooperating in functional modules to promote cancer development. In an effort to identify such modules, we deployed a genome-wide CRISPRi-based screening approach and nominated SE regions that are functionally linked to leukemia maintenance. In particular, we pinpointed a novel SE region regulating the expression of both tyrosine kinases KIT and PDGFRA. Whereas the inhibition of each kinase alone affected modestly cancer cell growth, combined inhibition of both receptors synergizes to impair leukemia cell growth and survival. Our results demonstrate that genome-wide screening of regulatory DNA elements can identify co-regulated genes collaborating to promote cancer and could open new avenues to the concept of combined gene inhibition upon single hit targeting.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveFor more than 25 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients, surgical intervention aiming at resecting brain regions where seizures arise is often the only alternative therapy. However, the identification of this epileptogenic zone (EZ) is often imprecise which may affect post-surgical outcomes (PSOs). Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been revealed to be reliable biomarkers in delineating EZ. In this paper, an analytical methodology aiming at automated detection and classification of interictal HFOs is proposed to improve the identification of EZ. Furthermore, the detected high-rate HFO areas were compared with the seizure onset zones (SOZs) and resected areas to investigate their clinical relevance in predicting PSOs.\\n\\nMethodsFIR band-pass filtering as well as a combination of time-series local energy, peak, and duration analysis were utilized to identify high-rate HFO areas in interictal, multi-channel intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings. The detected HFOs were then classified into fast-ripple (FR), ripple (R), and fast-ripple concurrent with ripple (FRandR) events.\\n\\nResultsThe proposed method resulted in sensitivity of 91.08% and false discovery rate of 7.32%. Moreover, it was found that the detected HFO-FRandR areas in concordance with the SOZs would have better delineated the EZ for each patient, while limiting the area of the brain required to be resected.\\n\\nConclusionTesting on a dataset of 20 patients has supported the feasibility of using this method to provide an automated algorithm to better delineate the EZ.\\n\\nSignificanceThe proposed methodology may significantly improve the precision by which pathological brain tissue can be identified.",

    "abstract": "We report the development and laboratory testing of a novel Killer-Rescue (K-R) self-limiting gene drive system in Drosophila melanogaster. This K-R system utilizes the well-characterized Gal4/UAS binary expression system and the Gal4 inhibitor, Gal80. Three killer (K) lines were tested; these used either an autoregulated UAS-Gal4 or UAS-Gal4 plus UAS-hid transgene. One universal rescue (R) line was used, UAS-Gal80, to inhibit Gal4 expression. The K lines are lethal and cause death in the absence of R. We show that Gal4 RNA levels are high in the absence of R. Death is possibly due to transcriptional squelching from high levels of Gal4. When R is present, Gal4 activation of Gal80 would lead to inhibition of Gal4 and prevent overexpression. With a single release ratio of 2:1 engineered K-R to wildtype, we find that K drives R through the population while the percent of wild type individuals decreases each generation. The choice of core promoter for a UAS-Gal4 construct strongly influences the K-R system. With the strong hsp70 core promoter, K was very effective but was quickly lost from the population. With the weaker DSCP core promoter, K persisted for longer allowing the frequency of individuals with at least one copy of R to increase to over 98%. This simple gene drive system could be readily adapted to other species such as mosquito disease vectors for driving anti-viral or anti-parasite genes.\\n\\nSignificanceHere we report the development and testing of a novel self-limiting gene drive system, Killer-Rescue, in Drosophila melanogaster. This system is composed of an auto-regulated Gal4 Killer (K) and a Gal4-activated Gal80 Rescue (R). Overexpression of Gal4 is lethal but in the presence of R, activation of Gal80 leads to much lower levels of Gal4 and rescue of lethality. We demonstrate that with a single 2:1 engineered to wildtype release, more than 98% of the population carry R after eight generations. We discuss how this Killer-Rescue system may be used for population replacement in a human health pest, Aedes aegypti, or for population suppression in an agricultural pest, Drosophila suzukii.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is emerging as a biomonitoring tool available to the citizen science community that promises to augment or replace photographic observation. However, eDNA results and photographic observations have rarely been compared to document their individual or combined power. Here, we use eDNA multilocus metabarcoding, a method deployed by the CALeDNA Program, to inventory and evaluate biodiversity variation along the Pillar Point headland near Half Moon Bay, California. We describe variation in presence of 13,000 taxa spanning 82 phyla, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of beta diversity, and identify metacommunities. Inventory and measures of turnover across space and time from eDNA analysis are compared to the same measures from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data, which contain information largely contributed by iNaturalist photographic observations. We find eDNA depicts local signals with high seasonal turnover, especially in prokaryotes. We find a diverse community dense with pathogens and parasites in the embayment, and a State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA) with lower species richness than the rest of the beach peninsula, but with beta diversity signals showing resemblance to adjacent unprotected tidepools. The SMCA differs in observation density, with higher density of protozoans, and animals in Ascidiacea, Echinoidea, and Polycladida. Local contributions to beta diversity are elevated in a section of East-facing beach. GBIF observations are mostly from outside the SMCA, limiting some spatial comparisons. However, our findings suggest eDNA samples can link the SMCA sites to sites with better GBIF inventory, which may be useful for imputing species from one site given observations from another. Results additionally support >3800 largely novel biological interactions. This research, and accompanying interactive website support eDNA as a gap-filling tool to measure biodiversity that is available to community and citizen scientists.",

    "abstract": "Elevations in glucocorticoid levels (GCs) in breeding females may induce adaptive shifts in offspring life histories. Offspring produced by mothers with elevated GCs may be better prepared to face harsh environments where a faster pace of life is beneficial. We examined how experimentally elevated GCs in pregnant or lactating North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) affected offspring postnatal growth, structural size, oxidative stress levels (two antioxidants and oxidative protein damage) in three different tissues (blood, heart, liver), and liver telomere lengths. We predicted that offspring from mothers treated with GCs would grow faster but would also have higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres, which may predict reduced longevity. Offspring from mothers treated with GCs during pregnancy were 8.3% lighter around birth but grew (in body mass) 17.0% faster than those from controls, whereas offspring from mothers treated with GCs during lactation grew 34.8% slower than those from controls and did not differ in body mass around birth. Treating mothers with GCs during pregnancy or lactation did not alter the oxidative stress levels or telomere lengths of their offspring. Fast-growing offspring from any of the treatment groups did not have higher oxidative stress levels or shorter telomere lengths, indicating that offspring that grew faster early in life did not exhibit oxidative costs after this period of growth. Our results indicate that elevations in maternal GCs may induce plasticity in offspring growth without long-term oxidative costs to the offspring that might result in a shortened lifespan.\n\nSummary StatementWe show that experimental increases in glucocorticoids in breeding female North American red squirrels affects offspring postnatal growth but not levels of oxidative damage and antioxidants or telomere lengths.",

Neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell in the pulmonary vasculature, are critical to immunity but they are also capable of generating life-threatening pathology. Natural Killer cells are the most highly represented lymphocyte subset in the lung, but relatively little is known about their localization, motility or the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to local homeostasis. Here, we used lung-intravital microscopy to directly visualise and quantify neutrophil and natural killer cell dynamics in the pulmonary vasculature of live mice. This approach revealed unexpected sessile behaviour by intravascular natural killer cells. Interactions with natural killer cells made neutrophils scan the endothelium more slowly over larger distances and reduced the number of neutrophils that accumulated in an LPS-triggered inflammatory challenge. This represents a new paradigm by which natural killer cells contribute to lung physiology by diminishing potentially pathogenic neutrophil accumulation.",

However, compared with its constituent elements such as individual landmarks, neural substrates of coherent spatial information remain largely unknown. The present study investigated how the brain codes map-like representations in a virtual environment specified by the relative positions of three objects. Representational similarity analysis revealed an object-based spatial representation in the hippocampus (HPC) when participants located themselves within the environment, while the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) represented it when they recollected a target objects location relative to their self-body. During recollection, task-dependent functional connectivity increased between the two areas implying exchange of self- and target-location signals between the HPC and mPFC. Together, the coherent cognitive map, which could be formed by objects, may be recruited in the HPC and mPFC for complementary functions during navigation, which may generalize to other aspects of cognition, such as navigating social interactions.",

However, no transcriptomic and genomic data for molecular characterization are available for these plants.\n\nTranscriptome sequencing is a valuable resource for determining the genetic basis of ecological-meaningful traits, especially in non-model organisms. Here we describe the de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly of Iris atropurpurea, an endangered species, endemic to Israels coastal plain. We employed RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of roots, leaves, and three stages of developing flower buds. To identify genes involved in developmental processes we generated phylogenetic gene trees for two major gene families, the MADS-box and MYB transcription factors, which play an important role in plant development. In addition, we identified 1,503 short sequence repeats that can be developed for molecular markers for population genetics in irises.\n\nIn the era of large genetic datasets, the Iris transcriptome sequencing provides a valuable resource for studying adaptation-associated traits in this non-model plant. This first reported transcriptome for the Royal Irises, and the data generated from this study, will facilitate gene discovery, functional genomic studies, and development of molecular markers in irises, to complete the intensive eco-evolutionary studies of this group.",

    "abstract": "The genus Castanea in North America contains multiple tree and shrub taxa of conservation concern. The two species within the group, American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and chinquapin (C. pumila sensu lato), display remarkable morphological diversity across their distributions in the eastern United States and southern Ontario. Previous investigators have hypothesized that hybridization between C. dentata and C. pumila has played an important role in generating morphological variation in wild populations. A putative hybrid taxon, Castanea alabamensis, was identified in northern Alabama in the early 20th century; however, the question of its hybridity has been unresolved. We tested the hypothesized hybrid origin of C. alabamensis using genome-wide sequence-based genotyping of C. alabamensis, all currently recognized North American Castanea taxa, and two Asian Castanea species at >100,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. With these data, we generated a high-resolution phylogeny, tested for admixture among taxa, and analyzed population genetic structure of the study taxa. Bayesian clustering and principal components analysis provided no evidence of admixture between C. dentata and C. pumila in C. alabamensis genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated that C. alabamensis forms a distinct group within C. pumila sensu lato. Our results are consistent with the model of a nonhybrid origin for C. alabamensis. Our finding of C. alabamensis as a genetically and morphologically distinct group within the North American chinquapin complex provides further impetus for the study and conservation of the North American Castanea species.",

Here we explore the role of proteases in antibiotic tolerance, short-term population survival of antibiotics, using queueing theory (i.e. the study of waiting lines), computational models, and a synthetic biology approach. Proteases are key cellular components that degrade proteins and play an important role in a multi-drug tolerant subpopulation of cells, called persisters. We found that queueing at the protease ClpXP increases antibiotic tolerance ~80 and ~60 fold in an E. coli population treated with ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. There does not appear to be an effect on antibiotic persistence, which we distinguish from tolerance based on population decay. These results demonstrate that proteolytic queueing is a practical method to probe bacterial tolerance and related genes, while limiting the unintended consequences frequently caused by gene knockout and overexpression.",

Their main cellular functions are to proofread errors of transcription and to restart elongation via stimulation of RNA hydrolysis by the active centre of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Very few taxons lack these factors, including the large evolutionarily ancient group of cyanobacteria and their descendants, the chloroplasts. How do they cope? What compensatory mechanisms they possess?\\n\\nWe found that cyanobacterial RNAP functionally substitutes for Gre/TFIIS - it does not stall on DNA, it efficiently catalyses the proofreading reaction of RNA hydrolysis, and the drop in transcription fidelity is only fractional, as confirmed by NGS. This alternative, presumably primordial, route to fidelity and processivity in the absence of Gre/TFIIS factors is based on the active site of RNAP stabilisation in a closed conformation. However, here lies a trade off - a severely reduced ability of this active site to recognise regulatory pausing signals. We suggest that perhaps the main advantage of Gre/TFIIS acquisition was to allow transcription regulation via pausing; with increase in fidelity as a bonus side effect.",

    "abstract": "Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) Grand Challenge 4 (GC4) offered a unique opportunity for designing and testing novel methodology for accurate docking and affinity prediction of ligands in an open and blinded manner. We participated in the beta-secretase 1 (BACE) Subchallenge which is comprised of cross-docking and redocking of 20 macrocyclic ligands to BACE and predicting binding affinity for 154 macrocyclic ligands. For this challenge, we developed machine learning models trained specifically on BACE. We developed a deep neural network (DNN) model that used a combination of both structure and ligand-based features that outperformed simpler machine learning models. According to the results released by D3R, we achieved a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of 0.43(7) for predicting the affinity of 154 ligands. We describe the formulation of our machine learning strategy in detail. We compared the performance of DNN with linear regression, random forest, and support vector machines using ligand-based, structure-based, and combining both ligand and structure-based features. We compared different structures for our DNN and found that performance was highly dependent on fine optimization of the L2 regularization hyperparameter, alpha. We also developed a novel metric of ligand three-dimensional similarity inspired by crystallographic difference density maps to match ligands without crystal structures to similar ligands with known crystal structures. This report demonstrates that detailed parameterization, careful data training and implementation, and extensive feature analysis are necessary to obtain strong performance with more complex machine learning methods. Post hoc analysis shows that scoring functions based only on ligand features are competitive with those also using structural features. Our DNN approach tied for fifth in predicting BACE-ligand binding affinities.",

    "abstract": "Integrodifference equations (IDEs) are often used for discrete-time continuous-space models in mathematical biology. The model includes two stages: the reproduction stage, and the dispersal stage. The output of the model is the population density of a species for the next generation across the landscape, given the current population density. Most previous models for dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape approximate the landscape by a set of homogeneous patches, and allow for different demographic and dispersal rates within each patch. Some work has been done designing and analyzing models which also include a patch preference at the boundaries, which is commonly referred to as the degree of bias. Individuals dispersing across a patchy landscape can detect the changes in habitat at a neighborhood of a patch boundary, and as a result, they might change the direction of their movement if they are approaching a bad patch.\\n\\nIn our work, we derive a generalization of the classic Laplace kernel, which includes different dispersal rates in each patch as well as different degrees of bias at the patch boundaries. The simple Laplace kernel and the truncated Laplace kernel most often used in classical work appear as special cases of this general kernel. The form of this general kernel is the sum of two different terms: the classic truncated Laplace kernel within each patch, and a correction accounting for the bias at patch boundaries.",
