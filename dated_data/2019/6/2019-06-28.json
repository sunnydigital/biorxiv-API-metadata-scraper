    "abstract": "AimThis paper aims to inform our knowledge of common babys breaths (Gypsophila paniculata) current population structure and invasion status using a combination of contemporary genetic methods and historical herbarium data.\\n\\nTaxonGypsophila paniculata (Angiosperms: Eudicot, Caryophyllaceae)\\n\\nLocationSamples were collected from seven locations spanning a portion of the plants North American range: Washington, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Michigan, United States.\\n\\nMethodsTo analyze contemporary population structure, individuals of G. paniculata from 7 distinct sampling locations were collected and genotyped at 14 microsatellite loci. Population structure was inferred using both Bayesian and multivariate methods. To investigate G. paniculatas invasion status, public herbarium databases were searched for mention of the species. Records were combined, resulting in a database of 307 herbarium collections dating from the late 1800s to current day. Using this database, invasion curves were created at different geospatial scales.\\n\\nResultsResults of genetic analyses suggest the presence of at least two genetic clusters spanning our seven sampling locations. Sampling locations in Washington, North Dakota, Minnesota, and northwestern Michigan form one genetic cluster, distinct from our two more southern sampling locations in Michigan, which form a second cluster with increased relative genetic diversity. Invasion curves created for these two clusters show different time periods of invasion. An invasion curve created for North America suggests G. paniculatas range may still be expanding.\\n\\nMain conclusionsGypsophila paniculata has likely undergone at least two distinct invasions in North America, and its range may still be expanding. Restricted genetic diversity seen across a wide geographic area could be a signature of limited seed distributors present during the early period of this garden ornamentals invasion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe traditional concept that heritability occurs exclusively from the transfer of germline-restricted genetics is being challenged by the increasing accumulation of evidence confirming the existence of experience-dependent transgenerational inheritance. However, questions remain unanswered as to how heritable information can be passed from somatic cells. Previous studies have implicated the critical involvement of RNA in heritable transgenerational effects and the high degree of mobility and genomic impact of RNAs in all organisms is an attractive model for the efficient transfer of genetic information.\\n\\nResultsWe hypothesized that RNA may be transported from a somatic tissue, in this case the brain, of an adult male mouse to the germline, and subsequently to offspring. To investigate this, we injected one hemisphere of the male mouse striatum with an AAV1/9 virus expressing human pre-MIR941 (MIR941). After 2, 8 and 16 weeks following injection, we used an LNA-based qPCR system to detect the presence of virus and human MIR941 in brain, peripheral tissues and offspring, from injected male mice mated with uninjected females. Virus was never detected outside of the brain. Verification of single bands of the correct size for MIR941 was performed using Sanger sequencing while quantitation demonstrated that a small percentage ([~] 1-8%) of MIR941 is transported to the germline and to offspring in about a third of the cases.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that somatic RNA can be transported to the germline and passed on to offspring, thereby providing additional evidence of a role for RNA in somatic cell-derived transgenerational effects.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >240 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), however most loci have been identified in analyses of European-ancestry individuals. To examine T2D risk in East Asian individuals, we meta-analyzed GWAS data in 77,418 cases and 356,122 controls. In the main analysis, we identified 298 distinct association signals at 178 loci, and across T2D association models with and without consideration of body mass index and sex, we identified 56 loci newly implicated in T2D predisposition. Common variants associated with T2D in both East Asian and European populations exhibited strongly correlated effect sizes. New associations include signals in/near GDAP1, PTF1A, SIX3, ALDH2, a microRNA cluster, and genes that affect muscle and adipose differentiation. At another locus, eQTLs at two overlapping T2D signals act through two genes, NKX6-3 and ANK1, in different tissues. Association studies in diverse populations identify additional loci and elucidate disease genes, biology, and pathways.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common metabolic disease primarily caused by insufficient insulin production and/or secretion by the pancreatic {beta} cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues1. Most genetic loci associated with T2D have been identified in populations of European (EUR) ancestry, including a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of nearly 900,000 individuals of European ancestry that identified >240 loci influencing the risk of T2D2. Differences in allele frequency between ancestries affect the power to detect associations within a population, particularly among variants rare or monomorphic in one population but more frequent in another3,4. Although smaller than studies in European populations, a recent T2D meta-analysis in almost 200,000 Japanese individuals identified 28 additional loci4. The relative contributions of different pathways to the pathophysiology of T2D may also differ between ancestry groups. For example, in East Asian (EAS) populations, T2D prevalence is greater than in European populations among people of similar body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference5. We performed the largest meta-analysis of East Asian individuals to identify new genetic associations and provide insight into T2D pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alphaproteobacterium that infects 40-60% of insect species and is well known for host reproductive manipulations. Although Wolbachia are primarily maternally transmitted, evidence of horizontal transmission can be found in incongruent host-symbiont phylogenies and recent acquisitions of the same Wolbachia strain by distantly related species. Parasitoids and predator-prey interactions may indeed facilitate the transfer of Wolbachia between insect lineages but it is likely that Wolbachia are acquired via introgression in many cases. Many hypotheses exist as to explain Wolbachia prevalence and penetrance such as nutritional supplementation, protection from parasites, protection from viruses, or straight up reproductive parasitism. Using classical genetics we show that Wolbachia increase recombination in infected lineages across two genomic intervals. This increase in recombination is titer dependent as the wMelPop variant, which infects at higher load in Drosophila melanogaster, increases recombination 5% more than the wMel variant. In addition, we also show that Spiroplasma poulsonii, the other bacterial intracellular symbiont of Drosophila melanogaster, does not induce an increase in recombination. Our results suggest that Wolbachia infection specifically alters host recombination landscape in a dose dependent manner.\\n\\nArticle SummaryThe ubiquitous bacterial symbiont Wolbachia is known to alter host reproduction through manipulation of host cell biology, protect from pathogens, and supplement host nutrition. In this work we show that Wolbachia specifically increases host recombination in a dose dependent manner. Flies harboring Wolbachia exhibit elevated rates of recombination across the 2nd and X chromosomes and this increase is proportional to their Wolbachia load. In contrast, another intracellular symbiont, Spiroplasma, does not lead to an increase in recombination across the intervals tested. Our results point to a specific effect of Wolbachia infection that may have a significant effect on infected insect populations.",

    "abstract": "Mutations arise when DNA lesions escape DNA repair. To delineate the contributions of DNA damage and DNA repair deficiency to mutagenesis we sequenced 2,717 genomes of wild-type and 53 DNA repair defective C. elegans strains propagated through several generations or exposed to 11 genotoxins at multiple doses. Combining genotoxin exposure and DNA repair deficiency alters mutation rates or leads to unexpected mutation spectra in nearly 40% of all experimental conditions involving 9/11 of genotoxins tested and 32/53 genotypes. For 8/11 genotoxins, signatures change in response to more than one DNA repair deficiency, indicating that multiple genes and pathways are involved in repairing DNA lesions induced by one genotoxin. For many genotoxins, the majority of observed single nucleotide variants results from error-prone translesion synthesis, rather than primary mutagenicity of altered nucleotides. Nucleotide excision repair mends the vast majority of genotoxic lesions, preventing up to 99% of mutations. Analogous mutagenic DNA damage-repair interactions can also be found in cancers, but, except for rare cases, effects are weak owing to the unknown histories of genotoxic exposures and DNA repair status. Overall, our data underscore that mutation spectra are joint products of DNA damage and DNA repair and imply that mutational signatures computationally derived from cancer genomes are more variable than currently anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a T cell-mediated chronic skin disease and is associated with altered skin barrier integrity. Infants with mutations in genes involved in tissue barrier fitness are predisposed towards inflammatory diseases, but most do not develop or sustain the diseases, suggesting that there exist regulatory immune mechanisms to repair tissues and/or prevent aberrant inflammation. The absence of one single murine dermal cell type, the innate neonatal-derived IL-17 producing {gamma}{delta} T (T{gamma}{delta}17) cells, from birth resulted in spontaneous, highly penetrant AD with all the major hallmarks of human AD. In T{gamma}{delta}17 cell-deficient mice, basal keratinocyte transcriptome was altered months in advance of AD induction. Fulminant disease is driven by skin commensal bacteria dysbiosis and highly expanded dermal {beta} T clonotypes that produce the type three cytokines, IL-17 and IL-22. These results demonstrate that neonatal T{gamma}{delta}17 cells are innate skin regulatory T cells. The bifurcation of type 3 cytokine producing skin T cells into the homeostatic, early innate and pathogen-sensing, late adaptive T cell compartments underpin healthy skin and accounts for the dual function of type 3 cytokines in skin maintenance and inflammation.",

However, rapidly identifying closely-related genomes among a background of thousands of other genomes is challenging.\\n\\nMethodsWe describe a refinement to core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) where alleles at each gene are reproducibly converted to a unique hash, or short string of letters (hash-cgMLST). This avoids the resource-intensive need for a single centralised database of sequentially-numbered alleles. We test the reproducibility and discriminatory power of cgMLST/hash-cgMLST compared to mapping-based approaches in Clostridium difficile using repeated sequencing of the same isolates (replicates) and data from consecutive infection isolates from six English hospitals.\\n\\nResultsHash-cgMLST provided the same results as standard cgMLST with minimal performance penalty. Comparing 272 pairs of replicate sequences, using reference-based mapping there were 0, 1 or 2 SNPs between 262(96%), 5(2%) and 1(<1%) pairs respectively. Using hash-cgMLST or standard cgMLST, 197(72%) replicate pairs had zero gene differences, 37(14%), 8(3%) and 30(11%) pairs had 1, 2 and >2 differences respectively. False gene differences were clustered in specific genes and associated with fragmented assemblies.

    "abstract": "The hormone corticosterone (CORT)) has been hypothesized to be linked with fitness, but the directionality of the relationship is unclear. The \"CORT-fitness hypothesis\" proposes that high levels of CORT arise from challenging environmental conditions, resulting in lower reproductive success (a negative relationship). In contrast, the \"CORT-adaptation hypothesis\" suggests that, during energetically demanding periods, CORT will mediate physiological or behavioural changes that result in increased reproductive investment and success (a positive relationship). During two breeding seasons, we experimentally manipulated circulating CORT levels in female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) prior to egg laying, and measured subsequent reproductive effort, breeding success, and maternal survival. When females were recaptured during egg incubation and again during the nestling stage, the CORT levels were similar among individuals in each treatment group, and maternal treatment had no effect on indices of fitness. By considering variation among females, we found support for the \"CORT-adaptation hypothesis\"; there was a significant positive relationship between CORT levels during incubation and hatching and fledging success. During the nestling stage CORT levels were unrelated to any measure of investment or success. Within the environmental context of our study, relationships between maternal glucocorticoid levels and indices fitness vary across reproductive stages.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMaternal corticosterone levels predict breeding success of female tree swallows.",

    "abstract": "Atomistic description of protein fibril formation has remained prohibitive due to the complexity and long timescales of the conformational search problem. Here, we develop a multi-scale approach that combines a large number of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent to derive Markov State Models (MSMs) for simulation of fibril growth. The search for the in-registered fully bound fibril state is modeled as a random walk on a rugged 2D energy landscape along enumerated {beta}-sheet registry and hydrogen bonding states, whereas interconversions among nonspecific bound states and between nonspecific and hydrogen-bounded states are derived from kinetic clustering analysis. The reversible association/dissociation of an incoming peptide and overall growth kinetics are then computed from MSM trajectories. This approach is applied to derive a comprehensive description of fibril elongation of wild-type A{beta}16-22 and how it is modulated by phenylalanine to cyclohexane (CHA) mutations. The resulting models recapitulate the experimental observation that mutants CHA19 and CHA1920 accelerate fibril elongation, but have a relatively minor effect on the critical concentration for fibril growth. Importantly, the kinetic consequences of mutations arise from a complex perturbation of the network of productive and non-productive pathways of fibril grown. This is consistent with the expectation that non-functional states will not have evolved efficient folding pathways and, therefore, will require a random search of configuration space. This study highlights the importance of describing the complete energy landscape when studying the elongation mechanism and kinetics of protein fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral membrane proteins with intrinsic curvature can act both as sensors of membrane curvature and shape modulators of the underlying membranes. A well-studied example of such proteins is the mechano-chemical GTPase dynamin that assembles into helical filaments around membrane tubes and catalyzes their scission in a GTPase-dependent manner. It is known that the dynamin coat alone, without GTP, can constrict membrane tubes to radii of about 10 nanometers, indicating that the intrinsic shape and elasticity of dynamin filaments should play an important role in membrane remodeling. However, molecular and dynamic understanding of the process is lacking. Here, we develop a dynamical polymer-chain model for a helical elastic filament bound on a deformable membrane tube of conserved mass, accounting for thermal fluctuations in the filament and lipid flows in the membrane. The model is based on a locally-cylindrical helix approximation for dynamin. We obtain the elastic parameters of the dynamin filament by molecular dynamics simulations of its tetrameric building block and also from coarse-grained structure-based simulations of a 17-dimer filament. The results show that the stiffness of dynamin is comparable to that of the membrane. We determine equilibrium shapes of the filament and the membrane, and find that mostly the pitch of the filament, not its radius, is sensitive to variations in membrane tension and stiffness. The close correspondence between experimental estimates of the inner tube radius and those predicted by the model suggests that dynamins \\\"stalk\\\" region is responsible for its GTP-independent membrane-shaping ability. The model paves the way for future mesoscopic modeling of dynamin with explicit motor function.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of planar cell polarity (PCP) in the Drosophila eye requires correct specification of the R3/R4 pair of photoreceptor cells, determined by a Frizzled mediated signaling event that specifies R3 and induces Delta to activate Notch signaling in the neighboring cell, specifying it as R4. Here, we investigated the role of the Notch signaling negative regulator Numb in the specification of R3/R4 fates and PCP establishment in the Drosophila eye. We observed that Numb is transiently upregulated in R3 at the time of R3/R4 specification. This regulation of Numb levels in developing photoreceptors occurs at the post-transcriptional level and is dependent on Dishevelled, an effector of Frizzled signaling, and Lethal Giant Larva. We detected PCP defects in cells homozygous for numb15, but these defects were due to a loss of function mutation in fat (fatQ805*) being present in the numb15 chromosome. However, mosaic overexpression of Numb in R4 precursors (only) caused PCP defects and numb loss-of-function had a modifying effect on the defects found in a hypomorphic dishevelled mutation. Our results suggest that Numb levels are upregulated to reinforce the bias of Notch signaling activation in the R3/R4 pair, two post-mitotic cells that are not specified by asymmetric cell division.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is among the most diverse of all human pathogens, responsible for a range of clinical manifestations, from mild superficial infections such as pharyngitis to serious invasive infections such as necrotising fasciitis and sepsis. The drivers of these different disease phenotypes are not known. The GAS cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, streptolysin O (SLO), has well established cell and tissue destructive activity. We investigated the role of SLO in determining disease outcome in vivo, by using two different clinical lineages; the recently emerged hypervirulent outbreak emm type 32.2 strains, which result in sepsis, and the emm type 1.0 strains which cause septic arthritis. Using clinically relevant in vivo mouse models of sepsis and a novel septic arthritis model, we demonstrated that the amount and activity of SLO is vital in determining the pathotype of infection. The emm32.2 strain produced large quantities of highly haemolytic SLO that resulted in rapid development of sepsis. By contrast, the lower levels and haemolytic activity of emm1.0 SLO led to translocation of bacteria to joints. Importantly, sepsis associated strains that were attenuated by deletion or inhibition of SLO also translocated to the joint, confirming the key role of SLO in determining infection niche. Our findings demonstrate that SLO is key to in vivo pathotype and disease outcome. Careful consideration should be given to novel therapy or vaccination strategies that target SLO. Whilst neutralising SLO activity may reduce severe invasive disease, it has the potential to promote chronic inflammatory conditions such as septic arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic cases. The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extra-host) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain a compact and highly-diverged chemoreceptor complement and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In Brugia malayi, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod infectious stage (microfilariae) and mammalian infectious stage (L3) Brugia parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intra-mosquito migration while exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis towards host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for Brugia osm-9. Reverse genetic studies implicate both Brugia osm-9 and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit tax-4 in larval chemotaxis towards host serum, and these ion channel subunits rescue sensory defects in C. elegans osm-9 and tax-4 knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms, and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.",

    "abstract": "Clinical isolates of influenza virus produce pleiomorphic virions, ranging from small spheres to elongated filaments. The filaments are seemingly adaptive in natural infections, but their basic functional properties are poorly understood and functional studies of filaments often report contradictory results. This may be due to artefactual damage from routine laboratory handling, an issue which has been noted several times without being explored in detail. To determine whether standard laboratory techniques could damage filaments, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to rapidly and reproducibly quantity and characterise the dimensions of filaments. Most of the techniques we tested had minimal impact on filaments, but freezing to -70{degrees}C, a standard storage step before carrying out functional studies on influenza viruses, severely reduced both their concentration and median length. We noted that damage from freezing is likely to have affected most of the functional studies of filaments performed to date, and to address this we show that it can be mitigated by using the cryoprotectant DMSO. We recommend that functional studies of filaments characterise virion populations prior to analysis to ensure reproducibility, and that they use unfrozen samples if possible and cryoprotectants if not. These basic measures will support the robust functional characterisations of filaments that are required to understand their roles in natural influenza virus infections.",

Mice learned to perform an image change detection task with a set of eight natural scene images, viewing these images thousands of times. Subsequently, during 2-photon imaging experiments, mice performed the task with these familiar images and three additional sets of novel images. Novel images evoked stronger overall activity in both excitatory and VIP populations, and familiar images were more sparsely coded by excitatory cells. The temporal dynamics of VIP activity differed markedly between novel and familiar images: VIP cells were stimulus-driven by novel images but displayed ramping activity during the inter-stimulus interval for familiar images. Moreover, when a familiar stimulus was omitted from an expected sequence, VIP cells showed extended ramping activity until the subsequent image presentation. This prominent shift in response dynamics suggests that VIP cells may adopt different modes of processing during familiar versus novel conditions.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIExperience with natural images in a change detection task reduces overall activity of cortical excitatory and VIP inhibitory cells\\nC_LIO_LIEncoding of natural images is sharpened with experience in excitatory neurons\\nC_LIO_LIVIP cells are stimulus-driven by novel images but show pre-stimulus ramping for familiar images\\nC_LIO_LIVIP cells show strong ramping activity during the omission of an expected stimulus\\nC_LI",

Here we develop a temporal model for these unobserved molecular changes with a manifold learning method applied to RNA-Seq data collected from human postmortem brain samples collected within the ROS/MAP and Mayo Clinic RNA-Seq studies. We define an ordering across samples based on their similarity in gene expression and use this ordering to estimate the molecular disease stage - or disease pseudotime - for each sample. Disease pseudotime is strongly concordant with the burden of tau (Braak score, P = 1.0x10-5), A{beta} (CERAD score, P = 1.8x10-5), and cognitive diagnosis (P = 3.5x10-7) of LOAD. Early stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for controls and show changes in basic cellular functions. Late stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for late stage AD cases and show changes in neuroinflammation and amyloid pathologic processes. We also identify a set of late stage pseudotime samples that are controls and show changes in genes enriched for protein trafficking, splicing, regulation of apoptosis, and prevention of amyloid cleavage pathways. In summary, we present a method for ordering patients along a trajectory of LOAD disease progression from brain transcriptomic data.",

    "abstract": "Successful human hand and arm movements are typically carried out by combining visual, motoric, and proprioceptive information in planning, initiation, prediction, and control. The superior parietal lobule (SPL) has been argued to play a key role in integrating visual and motoric information particularly during grasping of objects and other such tasks which prioritise visual information. However, sign language production also engages SPL even though fluent signers do not visually track their hands or fixate on target locations. Does sign language production simply rely on the motoric/ proprioceptive processes engaged in visually guided action, or do the unique characteristics of signed languages change these processes? Fifteen fluent British Sign Language users named pictures while we administered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to left SPL, a control site, or no TMS. TMS to SPL had very specific effects: an increased rate of (sign-based) phonological substitution errors for complex two-handed signs (those requiring hand contact), but TMS did not slow or otherwise impair performance. Thus, TMS decreased the likelihood of detecting or correcting phonological errors during otherwise successful bimanual coordination, but it did not noticeably alter fine movement control. These findings confirm that for fluent signers SPL has adapted to monitor motor plans for discrete hand configurations retrieved from memory as well as more fine-grained aspects of visually guided actions.",

It is unclear to what extent the population is homogeneous with respect to their visual properties or if one can identify distinct sub-populations. Here we performed a cluster analysis based on measurements of the responses of single neurons in layer 6 of primary visual cortex to achromatic grating stimuli that varied in orientation, direction of motion, spatial and temporal frequency, and contrast. The visual stimuli were presented in a stimulus window that was also varied in size. Using the responses to parametric variation in these stimulus variables we extracted a number of tuning response measures and used them in the cluster analysis. Six main clusters emerged along with some smaller clusters. Additionally we asked whether parameter distributions from each of the clusters were statistically different. There were clear separations of parameters between some of the clusters, particularly for f1/f0 ratio, direction selectivity, and temporal frequency bandwidth but other dimensions also showed differences between clusters. Our data suggest that in layer 6, across the spatial extent of a single cortical hypercolumn, there are multiple parallel circuits that provide information about different aspects of the visual stimulus.",

Here we address the question: how does phenotypic variability of a microbial population affect its fitness? While this question has previously been studied for exponentially growing populations, the situation when the population size is kept fixed has received much less attention. We show that in competition experiments with multiple microbial species, the fitness of the population can be determined from the distribution of phenotypes, provided all variability is due to intrinsic factors. We then explore how robust the relationship between fitness and phenotypic variability is to environmental fluctuations. We find that this relationship breaks down in the presence of environmental fluctuations, and derive a simple formula relating the average fitness of a population to the phenotype distribution and fluctuations in the instantaneous population growth rate. Using published experimental data we demonstrate how our formulas can be used to discriminate between intrinsic and environmental contributions to phenotypic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are important for many processes beyond nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, including protein modification, chromatin remodeling, transcription, mRNA processing and mRNA export. The multi-faceted nature of NPCs and the slow turnover of their components has made it difficult to understand the role of basket nucleoporins (Nup153, Nup50 and Tpr) in these diverse processes. To address this question, we used an Auxin-Induced Degron (AID) system to distinguish roles of basket nucleoporins: Loss of individual nucleoporins caused distinct alteration in patterns of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and gene expression. Importantly, Tpr elimination caused rapid and pronounced changes in transcriptomic profiles within two hours of auxin addition. These changes were dissimilar to shifts observed after loss of Nup153 or Nup50, but closely related to changes after depletion of mRNA export receptor NXF1 or the GANP subunit of the TRanscription-EXport-2 (TREX-2) mRNA export complex. Moreover, GANP association to NPCs was specifically disrupted upon TPR depletion. Together, our findings demonstrate a unique and pivotal role of Tpr in regulating gene expression through GANP- and/or NXF1-dependent mRNA nuclear export.",

We constructed an ensemble of 668 gLV models that explained 79% of the data on average. The models indicated (at a 70% level of confidence) a strong positive interaction from emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which we could validate using data from a nearby observation site, and predicted that the relative abundances of most fish species will continue to fluctuate temporally and concordantly in the near future. The network shows that the invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has much stronger impacts on native predators than on prey, supporting the notion that the invader perturbs the native food chain by replacing the diets of predators.\n\nConclusionsEnsemble approaches constrained by prior knowledge can improve inference and produce networks from noisy and sparsely sampled time series data to fill knowledge gaps on real world ecosystems.

However little is known about the effects of perturbations on the social cohesion of group-living animals.\\nC_LIO_LITo explore the strength of social cohesion and its dynamics under perturbations, we studied an ecological system involving a colonial, long-lived species living in a site experiencing a shift to a perturbed regime. This regime, caused by the invasion of predators, led this colony to hold from 70% to only 3% of the total world population in only one decade. Because birds breed aggregated in discrete and annually changing patches within large colonies, we could disentangle whether annual aggregation was random or resulted from social bonding among individuals. Our goals were 1) to uncover if there was any long-term social bonding between individuals and 2) to examine whether the perturbation regime affected social cohesion.\\nC_LIO_LIWe explored social cohesion by means of contingency tables and, within the Social Network Analysis framework, by modeling interdependencies among observations using additive and multiplicative effects (AME) and accounted for missing data.

    "abstract": "The integrity and organization of animal tissues depends upon specialized protein complexes that mediate adhesion between cells with each other (cadherin-based adherens junctions), and with the extracellular matrix (integrin-based focal adhesions). Reconstructing how and when these cell junctions evolved is central to understanding early tissue evolution in animals. We examined focal adhesion protein homologs in tissues of the freshwater sponge, Ephydatia muelleri (phylum Porifera). We found that sponge homologs of focal adhesion proteins co-precipitate as a complex and localize to cell junctions in sponge tissues. These data support that the adhesion roles of these proteins evolved early, prior to the divergence of sponges and other animals. However, in contrast to the spatially partitioned distribution of cell junctions in epithelia of other animals, focal adhesion proteins were found to be co-distributed with the adherens junction protein Em{beta}-catenin in sponge tissues; both at certain cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. Sponge adhesion structures were found to be unique in other ways, too. The basopinacoderm (substrate-attachment epithelium) lacks typical polarity in that cell-ECM adhesions form on both basal and apical surfaces, and compositionally unique cell junctions form at the interface between cells with spicules (siliceous skeletal elements) and between cells and environmental bacteria. These results clarify the diversity, distribution and molecular composition of cell junctions in tissues of E. muelleri, but raise new questions about their function and homology with cell junctions in other animals.",

    "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common, seen in 1-5% of the population in the United States and Canada. Children diagnosed with FASD are not likely to remain with their biological parents, facing early maternal separation and foster placements throughout childhood. We have modeled FASD in mice via prenatal alcohol exposure and further induce early life stress through maternal separation. We report an association between adult hippocampal gene expression and prenatal ethanol exposure followed by postnatal separation stress that is related to behavioral changes. Clustering of expression profiles through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identifies a set of transcripts, module 19, associated with anxiety-like behavior (r = 0.79, p = 0.002) as well as treatment group (r = 0.68, p = 0.015). Genes in this module are overrepresented by genes involved in transcriptional regulation and other pathways related to neurodevelopment. Interestingly, one member of this module, Polr2a, polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A, is downregulated by the combination of prenatal ethanol and postnatal stress in an RNA-Seq experiment and qPCR validation (q = 2e-12, p = 0.004, respectively). Together, transcriptional control in the hippocampus is implicated as a potential underlying mechanism leading to anxiety-like behavior via environmental insults. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism involved and use this insight towards early diagnosis and amelioration strategies involving children born with FASD.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMouse hippocampal gene expression alterations following prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal separation are associated with behavioral deficits. Transcriptomic analysis implicates systems defect involving RNA processing, specifically including downregulation of Polr2a.",

    "abstract": "Gene repression and silencers are poorly understood. We reasoned that H3K27me3-rich regions (MRRs) of the genome defined from clusters of H3K27me3 peaks may be used to identify silencers that can regulate gene expression via proximity or looping. MRRs were associated with chromatin interactions and interact preferentially with each other. MRR component removal at interaction anchors by CRISPR led to upregulation of interacting target genes, altered H3K27me3 and H3K27ac levels at interacting regions, and altered chromatin interactions. Chromatin interactions did not change at regions with high H3K27me3, but regions with low H3K27me3 and high H3K27ac levels showed changes in chromatin interactions. The MRR knockout cells also showed changes in phenotype associated with cell identity, and altered xenograft tumor growth. MRR-associated genes and long-range chromatin interactions were susceptible to H3K27me3 depletion. Our results characterized H3K27me3-rich regions and their mechanisms of functioning via looping.",

    "abstract": "Especially for the high-dimensional data collected in neuroscience, nonparametric statistical tests are an excellent alternative for parametric statistical tests. Because of the freedom to use any function of the data as a test statistic, nonparametric tests have the potential for a drastic increase in sensitivity by making a biologically-informed choice for a test statistic. In a companion paper (Geerligs & Maris, 2020), we demonstrate that such a drastic increase is actually possible. This increase in sensitivity is only useful if, at the same time, the false alarm (FA) rate can be controlled. However, for some study types (e.g., within-participant studies), nonparametric tests do not control the FA rate (see Eklund, Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016). In the present paper, we present a family of nonparametric randomization and permutation tests of which we prove exact FA rate control. Crucially, these proofs hold for a much larger family of study types than before, and they include both within-participant studies and studies in which the explanatory variable is not under experimental control. The crucial element of this statistical innovation is the adoption of a novel but highly relevant null hypothesis: statistical independence between the biological and the explanatory variable.",

Here, we use carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a human model system to prospectively evaluate correlates of neural regeneration and their relationship with clinical recovery after decompression surgery. At 6 months post-surgery, we noted a significant improvement of median nerve neurophysiological and somatosensory function. Serial skin biopsies revealed a partial recovery of intraepidermal innervation, whose extent correlated with symptom improvement. In myelinated afferents, nodal length increased postoperatively. Transcriptional profiling of the skin revealed 23 differentially expressed genes following decompression, with ADCYAP1 (encoding PACAP) being the most strongly upregulated and showing an association with regeneration of intraepidermal nerve fibres. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons, we confirmed that PACAP significantly enhances axon outgrowth in vivo.

    "abstract": "Microstructural changes associated with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in Parkinsons disease (PD) have been studied using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). However, these studies show inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological variations in delineation of SNc. To mitigate this, our work aims to construct a probabilistic atlas of SNc based on a Neuromelanin sensitive MRI (NMS-MRI) sequence and demonstrate its applicability to investigate microstructural changes on a large dataset of PD. Using manual segmentation and deformable registrations, we create a novel SNc atlas in the MNI space using NMS-MRI sequences of 27 healthy controls (HC). We employ this atlas to evaluate the diffusivity and anisotropy measures, derived from diffusion MRI in the SNc of 135 patients with PD and 99 HCs. Our observations of significantly increased diffusivity measures provide evidence of microstructural abnormalities in PD. However, no changes in the anisotropy were observed. Moreover, the asymmetry in abnormalities is prominent as the left SNc showed significant increase in diffusivity, and a reduction in FA when compared to the right SNc. Further the diffusivity and FA values also demonstrated a trend when correlated with the PD severity scores. Overall, from this work we establish a normative baseline for the SNc region of interest using NMS-MRI while the application on PD data emphasizes on the contribution of diffusivity measures rather than anisotropy of white matter in PD.",

    "abstract": "Key aspects of microbiome research are accurate identification of taxa followed by the profiling of their functionality. Amplicon profiling based on the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence is a ubiquitous technique to identify and profile the abundances of the various taxa. However, it does not provide information on their encoded functionality. Predictive tools which can accurately extrapolate the functional information of a microbiome based on taxonomic profile composition is essential. At present the applicability of these tools is however limited due to requirement of reference genomes from known species. We present IPCO (Inference of Pathways from Co-variance analysis), a new method of inferring functionality for 16S-based microbiome profiles independent of reference genomes. IPCO utilises the biological co-variance observed between paired taxonomic and functional profiles and co-varies it with the queried dataset. It outperforms other established methods both in terms of sample and feature profile prediction. Validation results confirmed that IPCO can replicate observed biological signals seen within shotgun and metabolite profiles. Comparative analysis of predicted functionality profiles with other popular 16S-based functional prediction tools indicates significantly lower performance with predicted functionality showing little to no correlation with paired shotgun features across samples.

Although several approaches have been attempted to predict the drug responses by analyzing molecular profiling data of tumors from preclinical cancer models or cancer patients, there is still a great need of developing highly accurate prediction models of response to the anti-cancer drugs for clinical applications toward personalized medicine. Here, we present PDXGEM pipeline to build a predictive gene expression model (GEM) for cancer patients drug responses on the basis of data on gene expression and drug activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.\\n\\nResultsDrug sensitivity biomarkers were identified by an association analysis between gene expression levels and post-treatment tumor volume changes in PDX models. Only biomarkers with concordant co-expression patterns between the PDX and cancer patient tumors were used in random-forest algorithm to build a drug response prediction model, so called PDXGEM. We applied PDXGEM to several cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as targeted therapy agents that are used to treat breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer. Significantly accurate predictions of PDXGEM for pathological and survival outcomes were observed through extensive validation analyses of multiple independent cancer patient datasets obtained from retrospective observational study and prospective clinical trials.\\n\\nConclusionOur results demonstrated a strong potential of utilizing molecular profiles and drug activity data of PDX tumors for developing a clinically translatable predictive cancer biomarkers for cancer patients.

    "abstract": "Therapeutic targeting of epigenetic modulators offers a novel approach to the treatment of several diseases including cancer, heart diseases and AIDS. The cellular consequences of chemical compounds that target epigenetic regulators (epi-drugs) are complex. Epi-drugs affect global cellular phenotypes and cause local changes to gene expression due to alteration of a gene chromatin environment. Despite increasing use in the clinic, the mechanisms responsible for cellular changes are unclear. Specifically, to what degree the effects are a result of cell-wide changes or disease related locus specific effects is unknown. Here we developed a platform to systematically and simultaneously investigate the sensitivity of epi-drugs at hundreds of genomic locations by combining DNA barcoding, unique split-pool encoding and single cell expression measurements. Internal controls are used to isolate locus specific effects separately from any global consequences these drugs have. Using this platform we discovered wide-spread loci specific sensitivities to epi-drugs for three distinct epi-drugs that target histone deacetylase, DNA methylation and bromodomain proteins. By leveraging ENCODE data on chromatin modification, we identified features of chromatin environments that are most likely to be affected by epi-drugs. The measurements of loci specific epi-drugs sensitivities will pave the way to the development of targeted therapy for personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has a unique capacity to resolve the spatio-temporal development of brain activity from non-invasive measurements. Conventional MEG, however, relies on sensors that sample from a distance (20-40 mm) to the head due to thermal insulation requirements (the MEG sensors function at 4 K in a helmet). A gain in signal strength and spatial resolution may be achieved if sensors are moved closer to the head. Here, we report a study comparing measurements from a seven-channel on-scalp SQUID MEG system to those from a conventional (in-helmet) SQUID MEG system.\\n\\nWe compared spatio-temporal resolution between on-scalp and conventional MEG by comparing the discrimination accuracy for neural activity patterns resulting from stimulating five different phalanges of the right hand. Because of proximity and sensor density differences between on-scalp and conventional MEG, we hypothesized that on-scalp MEG would allow for a more high-resolved assessment of these activity patterns, and therefore also a better classification performance in discriminating between neural activations from the different phalanges.\\n\\nWe observed that on-scalp MEG provided better classification performance during an early post-stimulus period (15-30 ms). This corresponded to electroencephalographic (EEG) response components N16 and P23, and was an unexpected observation as these components are usually not observed in conventional MEG. They indicate that on-scalp MEG opens up for a richer registration of the cortical signal, allowing for sensitivity to what are potentially sources in the thalamo-cortical radiation and to quasi-radial sources.\\n\\nWe had originally expected that on-scalp MEG would provide better classification accuracy based on activity in proximity to the P60m component compared to conventional MEG. This component indeed allowed for the best classification performance for both MEG systems (60-75%, chance 50%). However, we did not find that on-scalp MEG allowed for better classification than conventional MEG at this latency. We believe this may be due to the limited sensor coverage in the recording, in combination with our strategy for positioning the on-scalp MEG sensors. We discuss how sensor density and coverage as well as between-phalange source field dissimilarities may influence our hypothesis testing, which we believe to be useful for future benchmarking measurements.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the noise distribution in magnitude diffusion MRI images is the centerpiece to quantify uncertainties arising from the acquisition process. The use of parallel imaging methods, the number of receiver coils and imaging filters applied by the scanner, amongst other factors, dictate the resulting signal distribution. Accurate estimation beyond textbook Rician or noncentral chi distributions often requires information about the acquisition process (e.g., coils sensitivity maps or reconstruction coeffcients), which is usually not available. We introduce two new automated methods using the moments and maximum likelihood equations of the Gamma distribution to estimate noise distributions as they explicitly depend on the number of coils, making it possible to estimate all unknown parameters using only the magnitude data. A rejection step is used to make the framework automatic and robust to artifacts. Simulations using stationary and spatially varying noncentral chi noise distributions were created for two diffusion weightings with SENSE or GRAPPA reconstruction and 8, 12 or 32 receiver coils. Furthermore, MRI data of a water phantom with different combinations of parallel imaging were acquired on a 3T Philips scanner along with noise-only measurements. Finally, experiments on freely available datasets from a single subject acquired on a 3T GE scanner are used to assess reproducibility when limited information about the acquisition protocol is available. Additionally, we demonstrated the applicability of the proposed methods for a bias correction and denoising task on an in vivo dataset acquired on a 3T Siemens scanner. A generalized version of the bias correction framework for non integer degrees of freedom is also introduced. The proposed framework is compared with three other algorithms with datasets from three vendors, employing different reconstruction methods. Simulations showed that assuming a Rician distribution can lead to misestimation of the noise distribution in parallel imaging. Results on the acquired datasets showed that signal leakage in multiband can also lead to a misestimation of the noise distribution. Repeated acquisitions of in vivo datasets show that the estimated parameters are stable and have lower variability than compared methods. Results for the bias correction and denoising task show that the proposed methods reduce the appearance of noise at high b-value. The proposed algorithms herein can estimate both parameters of the noise distribution automatically, are robust to signal leakage artifacts and perform best when used on acquired noise maps.",

    "abstract": "MotivationData integration promises to be one of the main catalysts in enabling new insights to be drawn from the wealth of biological data available publicly. However, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, both at the syntactic and the semantic level, still poses significant challenges for achieving interoperability among biological databases.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce an ontology-based federated approach for data integration. We applied this approach to three heterogeneous data stores that span different areas of biological knowledge: 1) Bgee, a gene expression relational database; 2) OMA, a Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) orthology data store, and 3) UniProtKB, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) store containing protein sequence and functional information. To enable federated queries across these sources, we first defined a new semantic model for gene expression called GenEx. We then show how the relational data in Bgee can be expressed as a virtual RDF graph, instantiating GenEx, through dedicated relational-to-RDF mappings. By applying these mappings, Bgee data are now accessible through a public SPARQL endpoint. Similarly, the materialised RDF data of OMA, expressed in terms of the Orthology ontology, is made available in a public SPARQL endpoint. We identified and formally described intersection points (i.e. virtual links) among the three data sources. These allow performing joint queries across the data stores. Finally, we lay the groundwork to enable nontechnical users to benefit from the integrated data, by providing a natural language template-based search interface.\\n\\nProject URLhttp://biosoda.expasy.org, https://github.com/biosoda/bioquery",

    "abstract": "In Benin, most of the spices used for food, medicine and ceremony are gathered from the wild as little attempt has been made so far for their domestication and cultivation. Consequently, many wild spices are prone to overexploitation and threatened by habitat loss. Also, little information is available regarding their occurrence areas and the factor determining their geographical distribution and richness. This study aimed at i) mapping the distribution and the richness of 14 wild spices, and ii) assessing the drivers of their distribution and richness patterns in the Sudano-Guinean zone of Benin. Data were collected during field exploration and from the database of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Species distribution was mapped, and a grid of 10 x 10 km cells and a circular neighborhood option with a radius of 10 km was used to assign points to grid cells, then species richness was mapped. The species were unequally distributed across the study area. High species richness occurs in Bassila and Zou phytodistricts. Three spice-rich areas are needed to capture all the wild spices at once. Interaction of mean temperature of driest quarter, altitude, and precipitation seasonality significantly shaped the distributional range of three wild spices (Aframomum alboviolaceum, Uvaria chamae and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides), while the same factors in addition to clay content between 5-15 cm, contributed significantly to create appropriate conditions for the cooccurrence of several species.\\n\\nResumeAu Benin, la plupart des epices utilisees pour lalimentation, en medecine et pour les ceremonies sont collectees dans la nature car tres peu de tentatives ont ete faites pour leur domestication et leur culture.

    "abstract": "Recurrent positive selection at the codon level is often a sign that a gene is engaged in a molecular arms race - a conflict between the genome of its host and the genome of another species over mutually exclusive access to a resource that has a direct effect on the fitness of both individuals. Detecting molecular arms races has led to a better understanding of how evolution changes the molecular interfaces of proteins when organisms compete over time, especially in the realm of host-pathogen interactions. Here, we present a method for detection of gene-level recurrent positive selection across entire genomes for a given phylogenetic group. We deploy this method on five mammalian clades - primates, mice, deer mice, dogs, and bats - to both detect novel instances of recurrent positive selection and to compare the prevalence of recurrent positive selection between clades. We analyze the frequency at which individual genes are targets of recurrent positive selection in multiple clades. We find that coincidence of selection occurs far more frequently than expected by chance, indicating that all clades experience shared selective pressures. Additionally, we highlight Polymeric Immunoglobulin Receptor (PIGR) as a gene which shares specific amino acids under recurrent positive selection in multiple clades, indicating that it has been locked in a molecular arms race for [~]100My. These data provide an in-depth comparison of recurrent positive selection across the mammalian phylogeny, and highlights of the power of comparative evolutionary approaches to generate specific hypotheses about the molecular interactions of rapidly evolving genes.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, length above 200 nt) exert crucial biological roles and have been implicated in cancers1,2. To characterize newly discovered transcripts, one major issue is to distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs. Since experimental methods are time-consuming and costly, computational methods are preferred for large-scale lncRNA identification. In a recent study, Amin et al.3 evaluated three deep-learning-based lncRNA identification tools (i.e., lncRNAnet4, LncADeep5, and lncFinder6) and concluded \\\"The LncADeep PR (precision recall) curve is just above the no-skill model and LncADeep showed poor overall performance\\\". This surprising conclusion is based on the authors use of a non-default setting of LncADeep. Actually, LncADeep has two models, one for full-length transcripts, and the other for transcripts including partial-length. Being aware of the difficulty of assembling full-length transcripts from RNA-seq dataset, LncADeeps default model is for transcripts including partial-length. However, according to the results posted on Amin et al.s website, the authors used LncADeep with full-length model, while they claimed to use the default setting of LncADeep, to identify lncRNAs from GENCODE dataset, which is composed of full- and partial-length transcripts. Thus, in their evaluation, the performance of LncADeep was underestimated. In this correspondence, we have tested LncADeeps default setting (i.e., model for transcripts including partial-length) on the datasets used in Amin et al.3, and LncADeep achieved overall the best performance compared with the other tools results reported by Amin et al.",

    "abstract": "Systems with strong horizontal and vertical gradients, such as fjords, are useful models for studying environmental forcing. Here we examine microbial (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) community changes associated with the surface low salinity layer (LSL) and underlying seawater in multiple fjords in Fiordland National Park (New Zealand). High rainfall (1200-8000 mm annually) and linked runoff from native forested catchments results in surface LSLs with high tannin concentrations within each fjord. These gradients are expected to drive changes in microbial communities. We used amplicon sequencing (16S and 18S) to assess the impact of these gradients on microbial communities and identified depth linked changes in diversity and community structure. With increasing depth we observed significant increases in Proteobacteria (15%) and SAR (37%), decreases in Opisthokonta (35%), and transiently increased Bacteroidetes (3% increase from 0 to 40 m, decreasing by 8% at 200 m). Community structure differences were observed along a transect from inner to outer regions, specifically 25% mean relative abundance decreases in Opisthokonta and Bacteroidetes, and increases in SAR (25%) and Proteobacteria (>5%) at the surface, indicating changes based on distance from the ocean. This provides the first in-depth view into the ecological drivers of microbial communities within New Zealand fjords.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian framework offers a flexible language for the consistent modular assembly of statistical models used by both minds and machines. Another algorithmic domain capable of adaptation in potentially high-dimensional and uncertain environments is Darwinian evolution. The equivalence of their fundamental dynamical equations, replicator dynamics and Bayesian update, hints at a deeper algorithmic analogy. Here we show, based on a unified mathematical discussion of evolutionary dynamics and statistical learning in terms of Bayesian graphical models, that this is indeed the case. Building blocks of Bayesian computations, such as inference in hierarchical models, filtering in hidden Markov models, gradient likelihood optimization, and expectation-maximization dynamics of mixture models, map naturally to fundamental concepts of evolution: multilevel selection, quasispecies dynamics, phenotypic adaptation and ecological competition, respectively. We believe that these correspondences point towards a more comprehensive understanding of flavors of adaptive computation observed in Nature, as well as suggesting new ways to combine insights from the two domains in engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMixed infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and antibiotic heteroresistance, continue to complicate tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment. Detection of mixed infections has been limited to molecular genotyping techniques, which lack the sensitivity and resolution to accurately estimate the multiplicity of TB infections. In contrast, whole genome sequencing offers sensitive views of the genetic differences between strains of M. tuberculosis within a sample. Although metagenomic tools exist to classify strains in a metagenomic sample, most tools have been developed for more divergent species, and therefore cannot provide the sensitivity required to disentangle strains within closely related bacterial species such as M. tuberculosis.\\n\\nHere we present QuantTB, a method to identify and quantify individual M. tuberculosis strains in whole genome sequencing data. QuantTB uses SNP markers to determine the combination of strains that best explain the allelic variation observed in a sample. QuantTB outputs a list of identified strains, their corresponding relative abundances, as well as a list of drugs for which resistance-conferring mutations (or heteroresistance) has been predicted within the sample.\\n\\nResultsWe show that QuantTB has a high degree of resolution, and is capable of differentiating communities differing by less than 25 SNPs and identifying strains down to 1x coverage. Using simulated data, we found QuantTB outperformed other metagenomic strain identification tools at detecting strains and quantifying strain multiplicity. In a real-world scenario, using a dataset of paired clinical isolates from a study of patients with either reinfections or relapses, we found that QuantTB could detect mixed infections and reinfections at rates concordant with a manually curated approach.\\n\\nConclusionQuantTB can determine infection multiplicity, identify hetero-resistance patterns, enable differentiation between relapse and re-infection, and clarify transmission events across seemingly unrelated patients - even in low-coverage (1x) samples. QuantTB outperforms existing tools and promises to serve as a valuable resource for both clinicians and researchers working with clinical TB samples.",

We report long-read sequencing of the whale shark genome to generate the best gapless chondrichthyan genome assembly yet with higher contig contiguity than all other cartilaginous fish genomes, and studied vertebrate genomic evolution of ancestral gene families, immunity, and gigantism. We found a major increase in gene families at the origin of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) independent of their genome duplication. We studied vertebrate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which are key in initiating innate immune defense, and found diverse patterns of gene family evolution, demonstrating that adaptive immunity in gnathostomes did not fully displace germline-encoded PRR innovation. We also discovered a new Toll-like receptor (TLR29) and three NOD1 copies in the whale shark. We found chondrichthyan and giant vertebrate genomes had decreased substitution rates compared to other vertebrates, but gene family expansion rates varied among vertebrate giants, suggesting substitution and expansion rates of gene families are decoupled in vertebrate genomes. Finally, we found gene families that shifted in expansion rate in vertebrate giants were enriched for human cancer-related genes, consistent with gigantism requiring adaptations to suppress cancer.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is one of the most challenging issues in public health. Antibiotic resistance can be selected by antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the concentrations typically occurring in natural and engineered environments. Meanwhile, many other emerging organic contaminants such as pesticides are frequently co-occurring with antibiotics in agriculture-related environments and municipal wastewater treatment plants. To investigate the effects of the co-existing, non-antibiotic pesticides on the development of antibiotic resistance, we conducted long-term exposure experiments using a model Escherichia coli strain. The results revealed that 1) the exposure to a high level (in mg/L) of pesticides alone led to the emergence of mutants with significantly higher resistance to streptomycin; 2) the exposure to an environmental level (in {micro}g/L) of pesticides together with a sub-inhibitory level (in sub mg/L) of ampicillin synergistically stimulated the selection of ampicillin resistance and the cross-selection of resistance to three other antibiotics (i.e., ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline). Resistance levels of mutants selected from co-exposure were significantly higher than those of mutants selected from ampicillin exposure only. The comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses indicate that distinct and diversified genetic mutations in ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants were selected from co-exposure, which likely caused holistic transcriptional regulation and the increased antibiotic resistance. Together, the findings provide valuable fundamental insights into the development of antibiotic resistance under environmentally relevant conditions, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms of the elevated antibiotic resistance induced by the exposure to pesticides.\\n\\nSignificance statementAntibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health globally. Besides clinically relevant environments, the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria in non-clinical environments can also potentially pose risks of therapy failures. This study showed that the long-term, environment-level exposure to pesticides with and without antibiotics significantly stimulated the development of greater antibiotic resistance. The resistant strains selected from the exposure to pesticides are genetically and metabolically distinct from the ones selected by the antibiotic only. Although it is still being debated regarding whether or not a large use of antibiotics in plant agriculture is harmful, our findings provide the first fundamental evidence that greater concerns of antibiotic resistance may result if antibiotics are applied together with non-antibiotic pesticides.",

    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistant bacteria present an urgent threat to modern medicine, creating a desperate need for the discovery of antibiotics with new modes of action. Natural products whose unique highly diverse structures have been shaped by evolution to possess biologically relevant activity are an ideal discovery ground for new antibiotics with new mechanisms of action. In this study we elucidate the mechanism of action of the Gram-positive antibiotic armeniaspirol, a compound for which resistant bacteria could not be selected for. We show that armeniaspirol inhibits the ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpYQ in biochemical assays and in the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. We then show that this activity dysregulates key proteins involved in the divisome and elongasome including FtsZ, DivIVA, and MreB all of which are known to inhibit cell division when upregulated. Inhibition of ClpXP and ClpYQ leading to dysregulation of the divisome and elongasome represents a new mechanism of action and armeniaspirol is the first known natural product inhibitor of the coveted anti-virulence target ClpP. Thus armeniaspirol is the lead compound for a promising new class of antibiotics with a unique pharmacology and a novel mechanism for combating antimicrobial resistance, making it a highly promising candidate for further development.",

    "abstract": "2{delta} proteins (Cacna2d1-4) are auxiliary subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels that also drive synapse formation and maturation. Because cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) only express one isoform of this family, 2{delta}-2 (Cacna2d2), we used PCs as a model system to examine roles of 2{delta} in excitatory synaptic function in a Cacna2d2 knockout mouse. Whole-cell recordings of PCs from acute cerebellar slices revealed altered climbing fiber (CF)-evoked complex spike generation, as well as increased amplitude and faster decay of CF-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). CF terminals in the KO were localized more proximally on PC dendrites, as indicated by VGLUT2+ immunoreactive puncta, and computational modeling demonstrated that the increased EPSC amplitude can be partly attributed to the more proximal location of CF terminals. In addition, CFs in KO mice exhibited increased multivesicular transmission, corresponding to greater sustained responses during repetitive stimulation, despite a reduction in the measured probability of release. Electron microscopy demonstrated that mutant CF terminals had twice as many vesicle release sites, providing a morphologic explanation for the enhanced glutamate release. Though KO CFs evoked larger amplitude EPSCs, the charge transfer was the same as wildtype as a result of increased glutamate re-uptake, producing faster decay kinetics. Together, the larger, faster EPSCs in the KO explain the altered complex spike responses, which degrade information transfer from PCs and likely contribute to ataxia in Cacna2d2 KO mice. Our results also illustrate the multidimensional synaptic roles of 2{delta} proteins.\n\nSignificance Statement2{delta} proteins (Cacna2d1-4) regulate synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis, but co-expression of multiple 2{delta} isoforms has obscured a clear understanding of how various 2{delta} proteins control synaptic function. We focused on roles of the 2{delta}-2 protein (Cacna2d2), whose deletion causes cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy in mice and humans. Because cerebellar Purkinje cells only expresses this single isoform, we studied excitatory climbing fiber synaptic function onto Purkinje cells in Cacna2d2 knockout mice. Using optical and electrophysiological analysis, we provide a detailed description of the changes in Purkinje cells lacking 2{delta}-2, and provide a comprehensive mechanistic explanation for how functional synaptic phenotypes contribute to the altered cerebellar output.",

    "abstract": "Categorical perception (CP) is an inherent property of speech perception. The response time (RT) of listeners perceptual speech identification are highly sensitive to individual differences. While the neural correlates of CP have been well studied in terms of the regional contributions of the brain to behavior, functional connectivity patterns that signify individual differences in listeners speed (RT) for speech categorization is less clear. To address these questions, we applied several computational approaches to the EEG including graph mining, machine learning (i.e., support vector machine), and stability selection to investigate the unique brain states (functional neural connectivity) that predict the speed of listeners behavioral decisions. We infer that (i) the listeners perceptual speed is directly related to dynamic variations in their brain connectomics, (ii) global network assortativity and efficiency distinguished fast, medium, and slow RT, (iii) the functional network underlying speeded decisions increases in negative assortativity (i.e., became disassortative) for slower RTs, (iv) slower categorical speech decisions cause excessive use of neural resources and more aberrant information flow within the CP circuitry, (v) slower perceivers tended to utilize functional brain networks excessively (or inappropriately) whereas fast perceivers (with lower global efficiency) utilized the same neural pathways but with more restricted organization. Our results showed that neural classifiers (SVM) coupled with stability selection correctly classify behavioral RTs from functional connectivity alone with over 90% accuracy (AUC=0.9). Our results corroborate previous studies by confirming the engagement of similar temporal (STG), parietal, motor, and prefrontal regions in CP using an entirely data-driven approach.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical work predicts that sexual selection can enhance natural selection, increasing the rate of adaptation to new environments and helping purge harmful mutations. While some experiments support these predictions, remarkably little work has addressed the role of sexual selection on compensatory adaptation--populations ability to compensate for the costs of deleterious alleles that are already present. We tested whether sexual selection, as well as the degree of standing genetic variation, affect the rate of compensatory evolution via phenotypic suppression in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster. These populations were fixed for a spontaneous mutation causing mild abnormalities in the male sex comb, a structure important for mating success. We fine-mapped this mutation to an [~]85 kb region on the X chromosome containing three candidate genes, showed that the mutation is deleterious, and that its phenotypic expression and penetrance vary by genetic background. We then performed experimental evolution, including a treatment where opportunity for mate choice was limited by experimentally enforced monogamy. Although evolved populations did show some phenotypic suppression of the morphological abnormalities in the sex comb, the amount of suppression did not depend on the opportunity for sexual selection. Sexual selection, therefore, may not always enhance natural selection; instead, the interaction between these two forces may depend on additional factors.",

    "abstract": "The Bicyclus lineage of satyrid butterflies exhibits male-specific traits, the scent organ complex, used for chemical communication during courtship. This complex consists of tightly packed brush-like scales (hair-pencils) that rub against scent patches to disperse pheromones, but the evolution and molecular basis of the organs male-limited development remains unknown. Here, we examine the evolution of the number and location of the scent patches and hair-pencils within 53 species of Bicyclus butterflies, and the involvement of the sex determinant gene doublesex (dsx) in scent organ development in Bicyclus anynana using CRISPR/Cas9. We show that scent patches and hair-pencils arose via multiple, independent gains, in a correlated manner. Further, an initially non-sex-specific Dsx protein expression pattern in developing wing discs becomes male-specific and spatially refined to areas that develop the scent organ complex over the course of development. Functional perturbations of dsx show that this gene is required for male patch development whereas hair-pencils can develop in both sexes without Dsx input. Dsx in females is, instead, required to repress hair-pencils. These findings suggest that the patches and hair-pencils evolve as correlated composite organs that are sex-limited via the spatial regulation of dsx. Divergence in the function of dsx isoforms occurs in both sexes, where the male isoform promotes patch development in males and the female isoform represses hair-pencil development in females, both leading to the development of male-limited traits. Furthermore, evolution in number and location of patches, but not of hair-pencils, appears to be regulated by spatial regulation of dsx.",

    "abstract": "How the membrane trafficking system spatially organizes intracellular activities and intercellular signaling networks is not well understood in plants. The Transport Protein Particle (TRAPP) complexes are known to play key roles in selective delivery of membrane vesicles to various subcellular compartments in yeast and animals, but remain to be fully characterized in plants. Here we interrogate the TRAPP complexes in Arabidopsis using quantitative proteomic approaches. TRS33 is a component shared by all TRAPP complexes in yeast and animals, and the Arabidopsis AtTRS33 is essential for the subcellular dynamics of other TRAPP components. Affinity purification of AtTRS33 followed by quantitative mass spectrometry identified fourteen interacting proteins; these include not only thirteen homologs of all known TRAPP components in yeast and mammals but also a novel protein we named TRAPP-interacting plant protein (TRIPP), which is conserved in multi-cellular photosynthetic organisms. Proteomic and molecular analyses showed that TRIPP specifically associates with the TRAPPII complex in vivo and directly interacts with the TRAPPII-specific subunits but not the subunits shared with TRAPPIII. TRIPP co-localizes with a subset of TRS33 compartments, and its localization is disrupted in the trs33 mutant. Loss-of-function tripp mutation caused growth and reproductive development defects, including partial photomorphogenesis in the dark. Our study demonstrates that plants possess at least two distinct TRAPP complexes similar to metazoan, and identifies TRIPP as a novel plant-specific component of the TRAPPII complex with important functions in plant growth and development.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a powerful tool for in vitro and non-invasive in vivo biomolecular and cellular investigations. Fluorescence lifetime is an intrinsic characteristic of any fluorescent dye which, to some extent, does not depend on excitation intensity and signal level. However, when used in vivo with visible wavelength emitting fluorophores, FLI is complicated by (i) light scattering as well as absorption by tissues, which significantly reduces fluorescence intensity, (ii) tissue autofluorescence (AF), which decreases the signal to noise ratio and (iii) broadening of the decay signal, which can result in incorrect lifetime estimation. Here, we report the use of a large-frame time-gated single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imager, SwissSPAD2, with a very short acquisition time (in the milliseconds range) and a wide-field microscopy format. We use the phasor approach to convert each pixels data into its local lifetime. The phasor transformation provides a simple and fast visual method for lifetime imaging and is particularly suitable for in vivo FLI which suffers from deformation of the fluorescence decay, and makes lifetime extraction by standard fitting challenging. We show, for single dyes, that the phasor cloud distribution (of pixels) increases with decay broadening due to scattering and decreasing fluorescence intensity. Yet, as long as the fluorescence signal is higher than the tissue-like phantom AF, a distinct lifetime can still be clearly identified with an appropriate background correction. Lastly, we demonstrate the detection of few hundred thousand A459 cells expressing the fluorescent protein mCyRFP1 through highly scattering phantom layers, despite significant scattering and the presence of the phantom AF.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParasite traits associated with transmission success, such as the number of infective stages released from the host, are expected to be optimized by natural selection. However, in the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a key transmission trait - the number of cercariae larvae shed from infected Biomphalaria spp. snails - varies significantly within and between different parasite populations and selection experiments demonstrate that this variation has a strong genetic basis. In this study, we compared the transmission strategies of two laboratory schistosome population and their consequences for their snail host.\\n\\nMethodsWe infected inbred Biomphalaria glabrata snails using two Schistosoma mansoni parasite populations (SmBRE and SmLE), both isolated from Brazil and maintained in the laboratory for decades. We compared life history traits of these two parasite populations by quantifying sporocyst growth within infected snails (assayed using qPCR), output of cercaria larvae, and impact on snail host physiological response (i.e. hemoglobin rate, laccase-like activity) and survival.\\n\\nResultsWe identified striking differences in virulence and transmission between the two studied parasite populations. SmBRE (low shedder (LS) parasite population) sheds very low numbers of cercariae, and causes minimal impact on the snail physiological response (i.e. laccase-like activity, hemoglobin rate and snail survival). In contrast, SmLE (high shedder (HS) parasite population) sheds 8-fold more cercariae (mean {+/-} se cercariae per shedding: 284{+/-}19 vs 2352{+/-}113), causes high snail mortality, and has strong impact on snail physiology. We found that HS sporocysts grow more rapidly inside the snail host, comprising up to 60% of cells within infected snails, compared to LS sporocysts which comprised up to 31%. Cercarial production is strongly correlated to the number of S. mansoni sporocyst cells present within the snail host tissue, although the proportion of sporocyst cells alone does not explain the low cercarial shedding of SmBRE.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated the existence of alternative transmission strategies in the S. mansoni parasite consistent with trade-offs between parasite transmission and host survival: a \\\"boom-bust\\\" strategy characterized by high virulence, high transmission and short duration infections and a \\\"slow and steady\\\" strategy with low virulence, low transmission but long duration of snail host infections.",

    "abstract": "The most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9ORF72 that contributes to neurodegeneration by both loss-of-function (decreased C9ORF72 protein levels) and gain-of-function (e.g. dipeptide repeat protein production) mechanisms. Although therapeutics targeting the gain-of-function mechanisms are in clinical development, it is unclear if these will be efficacious given the contribution of C9ORF72 loss-of-function processes to neurodegeneration. Moreover, there is a lack of therapeutic strategies for C9ORF72 ALS/FTD with demonstrated efficacy in vivo. Here, we show that small molecule inhibition of PIKFYVE kinase rescues both loss- and gain-of-function C9ORF72 disease mechanisms in vivo. We find that the reduction of C9ORF72 in mouse motor neurons leads to a decrease in early endosomes. In contrast, treatment with the PIKFYVE inhibitor apilimod increases the number of endosomes and lysosomes. We show that reduced C9ORF72 levels increases glutamate receptor levels in hippocampal neurons in mice, and that apilimod treatment rescues this excitotoxicity-related phenotype in vivo. Finally, we show that apilimod also alleviates the gain-of-function pathology induced by the C9ORF72 HRE by decreasing levels of dipeptide repeat proteins derived from both sense and antisense C9ORF72 transcripts in hippocampal neurons in vivo. Our data demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of PIKFYVE kinase inhibition in both gain- and loss-of-function murine models of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transport (EET) occurs in environmental iron-reducing bacteria and is mediated by an outer membrane multi-heme cytochrome complex (Cyts). It has critical implications for global mineral cycling and electrochemical microbial catalysis. The rate of EET mediated by multiple heme redox centers significantly increases in the presence of flavins and quinones. Their electron free energy does not entirely account for the fact that differential effects on EET rate enhancement vary significantly by factors [&ge;]100. Here, we report on whole-cell electrochemical analysis of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 using six flavin analogs and four quinones. We demonstrated that protonation of the nitrogen atom at position 5 (N5) of the isoalloxazine ring is essential for electron outflow acceleration as a bound non-covalent cofactor of Cyts. EET mediated by Cyts was accelerated at a rate dependent on pKa(N5). The EET rate largely decreased in response to the addition of deuterated water (D2O), while low concentration of D2O (4 %) had little impact on electron free energy difference of the heme and non-covalent bound cofactors, strongly suggesting that the protonation of N5 limits the rate of EET. Our findings directly link EET kinetics to proton transport reaction via N5 and provide a basis for the development of novel strategies for controlling EET-associated biological reactions.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe potential of various small molecules such as flavins and quinones to enhance the rate of extracellular electron transport (EET) has been exploited to develop environmental energy conversion systems. Flavins and quinones have similar molecular structures but their abilities to enhance EET vary by >100x in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. These large differences are inconsistent with conventional models, which rely on redox potentials or diffusion constant of shuttling electron mediators. In this study, we demonstrated that the basicity of the nitrogen atom of the isoalloxazine ring (N5) enhances the rate of electron outflow when a flavin or quinone is a non-covalent cofactor of S. oneidensis MR-1 outer membrane c-type cytochromes.",

We investigated the cellular basis for this altered myelin structure, and found that the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and mature oligodendrocytes to TNF and IL-1{beta} is modified by the expression of the sphingomyelin hydrolase nSMase2. OPCs do not express nSMase2, and exhibit a protective response to these cytokines manifest by decreased ceramide, increased sphingosine 1-phosphate, and increased cell motility. Mature oligodendrocytes express nSMase2, and respond to TNF and IL-1{beta} with a stress phenotype, evidenced by increased ceramide, decreased sphingosine, and active caspase 3. Pharmacological inhibition or a targeted genetic deletion of nSMase2 in vivo increased myelin thickness, and enhanced myelin compaction. These results suggest that inhibition of nSMase2 improves the quality of new myelin by protecting maturing/myelinating oligodendrocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of nSMase2 following a demyelinating event could stabilize the structure of these newly formed myelin sheaths and protect them from secondary demyelination.",
