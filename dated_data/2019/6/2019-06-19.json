    "abstract": "Every year tuberculosis kills above half million women all over the world. Nonetheless, the difference in the size of deaths among countries was not compared. Hence, this study is aimed to compare the death size of two countries. Socio demographic and clinical data of women treated for all form of tuberculosis in the past ten years 2007-2016 were collected from total of eight hospitals and six treatment centers of Tigray and Zigong respectively. Then, collected data were entered into SPSS version 21 then we estimated the magnitude of TB, level of treatment success and assessed factors associated with the unsuccessful TB outcome. In the past ten years, a total of 5603(41.5%) and 4527 (24.5%) tuberculosis cases were observed in Tigray and Zigong respectively. Of those with treatment outcome record a total of 2602(92%) in Tigray and 3916(96.7%) in Zigong were successfully treated. Total of 170 (6%) cases in Tigray and 36(0.8%) cases in Zigong were dead. In Tigray cases like retreatment (aOR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.16-0.53) and multi drug resistant (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.27) were less likely to show treatment success. But, HIV co-infected TB cases (aOR, 3.58; 95% CI: 2.47, 5.18) were more likely to show treatment success. In Zigong, women with MDR TB (Adjusted OR, 0.90; 95%CI: 0.24, 0.34) were less likely to show treatment success. On the other hand women in the age category of 15-49 (adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.206) showed treatment success. Big number of tuberculosis cases and death were observed in Tigray comparing with Zigong. Hence, a relevant measure should be considered to improve treatment outcome of women in Tigray.",

    "abstract": "The deluge of sequence information in the recent times provide us with an excellent opportunity to compare organisms on a large genomic scale. In this study we have tried to decipher the variation in the gene organization and structuring of a vital bacterial gene called ftsZ which codes for an integral component of the bacterial cell division, the FtsZ protein. FtsZ is homologous to tubulin protein and has been found to be ubiquitous in eubacteria. FtsZ is showing increasing promise as a target for antibacterial drug discovery. Our study of ftsZ protein from 143 different bacterial species spanning a wider range of morphological and physiological type demonstrates that the ftsZ gene of about ninety three percent of the organisms involved in our analyses show relatively biased codon usage profile and significant GC deviation from their genomic GC content. We have also detected a tendency among the different organisms to utilize a core set of codons in structuring the ftsZ coding sequence. Our meticulous analysis of the ftsZ gene linked with the corresponding FtsZ protein show that there is a bias towards the use of specific synonymous codons particularly in the helix and strand regions of the multi-domain FtsZ protein. Overall our findings suggest that in an indispensable and vital protein such as FtsZ, there is an inherent tendency to maintain form and structure for optimized performance in spite of the extrinsic variability in coding features.",

The time of disease evolution until RTX administration greatly varied. An important number of patients suffered renal complications (86%) before RTX treatment. The frequency of adverse effects from RTX was low (7%, hypersensitivity with no treatment interruption). In terms of disease evolution, 41 patients (95.3%) presented clinical improvement, 15 patients had recurrence after initial remission (34.9%) and 34 patients (79.1%) achieved full remission after completing treatment.

    "abstract": "Taxol (paclitaxel) is one of the most successful chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of human cancer. It has recently been questioned whether the mechanism of action in mitotic arrest, which is ubiquitously present in all cells, is sufficient to explain the tumor specificity, clinical efficacy, and side effects of taxol. In this report, we have identified a new protein target of taxol as GT198 (gene symbol PSMC3IP, also known as Hop2). GT198 is an oncoprotein and a DNA repair factor involved in human common solid tumors. The GT198 gene carries germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer families and recurrent somatic mutations in tumor microenvironment. Mutant GT198 was identified in pericyte stem cells on capillary blood vessels inducing tumor angiogenesis. GT198 is a DNA-binding protein dimer, also stimulates DNA repair, regulates meiosis, participates in homologous DNA recombination, and activates nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression. Here we show that taxol directly binds to the DNA-binding domain of GT198 in vitro. Taxol serves as an allosteric inhibitor to block DNA binding to GT198 with an IC50 of 8.6 nM. Labeled taxol colocalizes with GT198 in interphase nuclei of cultured cells. Decreased GT198 expression desensitizes taxolinduced cell death, and taxol inhibits GT198 nuclear foci formation during DNA repair. Together, these results demonstrate that GT198 is a previously unrecognized direct protein target of taxol. The finding of taxol target as an oncoprotein GT198 in common solid tumors provides a rationale for the clinical efficacy of taxol. We anticipate that GT198 may serve as a clinical predictive marker of taxol efficacy as well as a new drug target for future anti-cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Complex, time-varying responses have been observed widely in cell signaling, but how specific dynamics are generated or regulated is largely unknown. One major obstacle has been that high-throughput screens for identifying pathway components are typically incompatible with the live-cell assays used to monitor dynamics. Here, we address this challenge by performing a drug screen for altered Erk signaling dynamics in primary mouse keratinocytes. We screened a library of 429 kinase inhibitors, monitoring Erk activity over 5 h in more than 80,000 single live cells. The screen revealed both known and uncharacterized modulators of Erk dynamics, including inhibitors of non-EGFR receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that increased Erk pulse frequency and overall activity. Using drug treatment and direct optogenetic control, we demonstrate that drug-induced changes to Erk dynamics alter the conditions under which cells proliferate. Our work opens the door to high-throughput screens using live-cell biosensors and reveals that cell proliferation integrates information from Erk dynamics as well as additional permissive cues.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that plays an essential role in mammalian development. Genomic methylation patterns are dynamically maintained, with DNA methyltransferases mediating inheritance of methyl marks onto nascent DNA over cycles of replication. A recently developed experimental technique employing immunoprecipitation of bromodeoxyuridine labeled nascent DNA followed by bisulfite sequencing (Repli-BS) measures post-replication temporal evolution of cytosine methylation, thus enabling genome-wide monitoring of methylation maintenance. In this work, we combine statistical analysis and stochastic mathematical modeling to analyze Repli-BS data from human embryonic stem cells. We estimate site-specific kinetic rate constants for the restoration of methyl marks on >10 million uniquely mapped cytosines within the CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) dinucleotide context across the genome using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We find that post-replication remethylation rate constants span approximately two orders of magnitude, with half-lives of per-site recovery of steady-state methylation levels ranging from shorter than ten minutes to five hours and longer. Furthermore, we find that kinetic constants of maintenance methylation are correlated among neighboring CpG sites. Stochastic mathematical modeling provides insight to the biological mechanisms underlying the inference results, suggesting that enzyme processivity and/or collaboration can produce the observed kinetic correlations. Our combined statistical/mathematical modeling approach expands the utility of genomic datasets and disentangles heterogeneity in methylation patterns arising from replication-associated temporal dynamics versus stable cell-to-cell differences.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of waste from food industry and food services is a current concern due to the large amount of waste generated, including peels and fruit seeds. The objective of this study was to obtain a flour produced from Cantaloupe melon seeds (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) and to evaluate the viability of using the product as an ingredient in cake manufacturing. In this study, different formulations were developed: standard cake - 0% (F1) and cakes containing melon seed flour as substitute of wheat flour in 10% (F2), 30% (F3), and 50% (F4) concentrations. Centesimal composition, dietary fibre, structural and morphological characterization, determination of mineral composition, and evaluation of fatty acids profile in melon seed flour were carried out. To determine the overall acceptance of cake formulations, sensory analysis was performed with 135 non-trained panelists, which also included the identification of sensorial attributes using the Just About Right ideal scale test. The results showed that the melon seed flour has considerable nutritional value, with 18% proteins, 3% moisture, 4% ash, 30% lipids, and 35% dietary fibre. Melon flour also has a significantly high content of minerals, mainly phosphorus (1507.62 mg/100 g), potassium (957.35 mg/100 g), and magnesium (504.03 mg/100 g). The polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction was the most abundant in melon seed flour, with predominance of omega-6 fatty acids (17.95 g/mg of sample). Sensorial analysis disclosed good acceptance for formulations containing 10% and 30% of melon seed flour, with the 10% formulation being the most accepted. The research showed the feasibility of using the melon seed flour in cake production, as well as the possibility of using food waste in restaurants and food industries in order to adhere to sustainable production actions.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated motion and collective decision-making in fish schools result from complex interactions by which individuals integrate information about the behavior of their neighbors. However, little is known about how individuals integrate this information to take decisions and control their movements. Here, we combine experiments with computational and robotic approaches to investigate the impact of different strategies for a fish to interact with its neighbors on collective swimming in groups of rummy-nose tetra (Hemigrammus rhodostomus). By means of a data-based agent model describing the interactions between pairs of H. rhodostomus (Calovi et al., 2018), we show that the simple addition of the pairwise interactions with two neighbors quantitatively reproduces the collective behavior observed in groups of five fish. Increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the simulation results. Remarkably, we find that groups remain cohesive and polarized even when each agent only interacts with only one of its neighbors: the one that has the strongest contribution to the heading variation of the focal agent. However, group cohesion is lost when each agent only interacts with its nearest neighbor. We then investigate by means of a swarm robotic platform the collective motion in groups of five robots. Our platform combines the implementation of the fish behavioral model and an engineering-minded control system to deal with real-world physical constraints. We find that swarms of robots are able to reproduce the behavioral patterns observed in groups of five fish when each robot only interacts with its neighbor having the strongest effect on its heading variation, whereas increasing the number of interacting neighbors does not significantly improve the group coordination. Overall, our results suggest that fish have to acquire only a minimal amount of information about their environment to coordinate their movements when swimming in groups.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow do fish combine and integrate information from multiple neighbors when swimming in a school? What is the minimum amount of information about their environment needed to coordinate their motion? To answer these questions, we combine experiments with computational and robotic modeling to test several hypotheses about how individual fish could combine and integrate the information on the behavior of their neighbors when swimming in groups. Our research shows that, for both simulated agents and robots, using the information of two neighbors is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the collective motion patterns observed in groups of fish. Remarkably, our results also show that it is possible to obtain group cohesion and coherent collective motion over long periods of time even when individuals only interact with their most influential neighbor, that is, the one that exerts the most important effect on their heading variation.",

    "abstract": "Guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) belong to the dynamin-related superfamily and exhibit various functions in the fight against infections. The functions of the human guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1) are tightly coupled to GTP hydrolysis and dimerization. Despite known crystal structures of the hGBP1 monomer and GTPase domain dimer, little is known about the dynamics of hGBP1. To gain a mechanistic understanding of hGBP1, we performed sub-millisecond multi-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of both the hGBP1 monomer and dimer. We found that hGBP1 is a highly flexible protein that undergoes a hinge motion similar to the movements observed for other dynamin-like proteins. Another large-scale motion was observed for the C-terminal helix 13, providing a molecular view for the 13-13 distances previously reported for the hGBP1 dimer. Most of the loops of the GTPase domain were found to be flexible, disclosing why GTP binding is needed for hGBP1 dimerization to occur.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGunaylate binding proteins are key fighters against microbial and viral pathogens. In the human body there are seven types of such proteins, among which is the guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1). This protein is able to perform its function only once it is activated by binding and converting guanosinetriphosphat (GTP) to guanosinediphosphat and guanosinemonophosphat via hydrolysis. In concert with the conversion of GTP the dimerization of hGBP1 occurs, which can further interact with the lipid membrane of the pathogen and disrupt it. While the crystal structure of the protein is known, the activation and dimerization steps are not well understood at molecular level as studying them experimentally is difficult. An alternative approach is given by molecular simulations, allowing us to elucidate the protein dynamics closely connected to these steps. From our simulations applied to both the hGBP1 monomer and dimer we identified large-scale motions taking place in hGBP1 that had not been reported before. We discuss the relevance of these motions in terms of their biological function, such as possible membrane damage caused by one of the motions or locking the protein in the dimer state.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and quantifying the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is essential for directing public health responses, especially for pathogens capable of transmission between humans. However, determining a pathogens transmission dynamics is complicated by challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySurveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding of the disease dynamics and improving our ability to choose the optimal intervention strategy. We developed and tested a likelihood-based inference method based on a mechanistic model of the spillover and human-to-human transmission processes. We first used simulated datasets to explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans.",

    "abstract": "Current knowledge of the piRNA pathway is based mainly on studies on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, where three proteins of the Piwi subclade of the Argonaute family interact with PIWI-interacting RNAs to silence transposable elements in gonadal tissues. In mosquito species that transmit epidemic arboviruses such as the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, Piwi clade genes underwent expansion, are also expressed in the soma, and code for proteins that may elicit antiviral functions and crosstalk with other proteins of recognized antiviral mechanisms. These observations underline the importance of expanding our knowledge of the piRNA pathway beyond D. melanogaster.\\n\\nHere we focus on the emerging arboviral vector Aedes albopictus and we couple traditional approaches of expression and adaptive evolution analyses with most current computational predictions of protein structure to study evolutionary divergence among Piwi clade proteins. Superposition of protein homology models indicate high structure similarity among all Piwi proteins, with high levels of amino acid conservation in the inner regions devoted to RNA binding. On the contrary, solvent-exposed surfaces showed low conservation, with several sites under positive selection. Expression profiles of Piwi transcripts during mosquito development and after infection with the Dengue 1 virus showed a concerted elicitation of all Piwi transcripts during viral dissemination, while the maintenance of infection primarily relied on the expression of Piwi5. In contrast, establishment of persistent infection by the Chikungunya virus is accompanied by an increased expression of all Piwi genes, particularly Piwi4 and, again, Piwi5. Overall these results are consistent with functional specialization and a general antiviral role for Piwi5. Experimental evidences of sites under positive selection in Piwi1/3, Piwi4 and Piwi6, further provide useful knowledge to design tailored functional experiments.\\n\\nAuthor summaryArgonautes are ancient proteins involved in many cellular processes, including innate immunity. Early in eukaryote evolution, Argonautes separated into Ago and Piwi clades, which maintain a dynamic evolutionary history with frequent duplications and losses. The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism proved fundamental to understand the function of Argonautes. However, recent studies showed that the patterns and observations made in D. melanogaster, including the number of Argonautes, their expression profile and their function, are a rarity among Dipterans.\\n\\nIn vectors of epidemic arboviruses such as Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, Piwi genes underwent expansion, are expressed in the soma, and some of them appear to have antiviral functions. Besides being an important basic question, the identification of which (and how) Piwi genes have antiviral functions may be used for the development of novel genetic-based strategies of vector control. Here we coupled population genetics models with computational predictions of protein structure and expression analyses to investigate the evolution and function of Piwi genes of the emerging vector Aedes albopictus. Our data support a general antiviral role for Piwi5. Instead, the detection of complex expression profiles with the presence of sites under positive selection in Piwi1/3, Piwi4 and Piwi6 requires tailored functional experiments to clarify their antiviral role.",

    "abstract": "During the course of fungal infection, pathogen recognition by the innate immune system is critical to initiate efficient protective immune responses. The primary event that triggers immune responses is the binding of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which are expressed at the surface of host immune cells, to Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) located predominantly in the fungal cell wall. Most fungi have mannosylated PAMPs in their cell walls and these are recognized by a range of C-type lectin receptors (CTLs). However, the precise spatial distribution of the ligands that induce immune responses within the cell walls of fungi are not well defined. We used recombinant IgG Fc-CTLs fusions of three murine mannan detecting CTLs, including dectin-2, the mannose receptor (MR) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) 4-7 (CRD4-7), and human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN) and the {beta}-1,3 glucan-binding lectin dectin-1 to map PRR ligands in the fungal cell wall. We show that epitopes of mannan-specific CTL receptors can be clustered or diffuse, superficial or buried in the inner cell wall. We demonstrate that PRR ligands do not correlate well with phylogenetic relationships between fungi, and that Fc-lectin binding discriminated between mannosides expressed on different cell morphologies of the same fungus. We also demonstrate CTL epitope differentiation during different phases of the growth cycle of Candida albicans and that MR and DC-SIGN labelled outer chain N-mannans whilst dectin-2 labelled core N-mannans displayed deeper in the cell wall. These immune receptor maps of fungal walls therefore reveal remarkable spatial, temporal and chemical diversity, indicating that the triggering of immune recognition events originates from multiple physical origins at the fungal cell surface.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInvasive fungal infections remain an important health problem in immunocompromised patients. Immune recognition of fungal pathogens involves binding of specific cell wall components by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) and subsequent activation of immune defences. Some cell wall components are conserved among fungal species while other components are species-specific and phenotypically diverse. The fungal cell wall is dynamic and capable of changing its composition and organization when adapting to different growth niches and environmental stresses. Differences in the composition of the cell wall lead to differential immune recognition by the host. Understanding how changes in the cell wall composition affect recognition by PRRs is likely to be of major diagnostic and clinical relevance. Here we address this fundamental question using four soluble immune receptor-probes which recognize mannans and {beta}-glucan in the cell wall. We use this novel methodology to demonstrate that mannan epitopes are differentially distributed in the inner and outer layers of fungal cell wall in a clustered or diffuse manner. Immune reactivity of fungal cell surfaces did not correlate with relatedness of different fungal species, and mannan-detecting receptor-probes discriminated between cell surface mannans generated by the same fungus growing under different conditions. These studies demonstrate that mannan-epitopes on fungal cell surfaces are differentially distributed within and between the cell walls of fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase that is involved in a series of critical cellular processes, can be found in two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In contrast to mTORC1, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate mTORC2. Here we show that mTORC2 activity is reduced in mice with a hypomorphic mutation of the Ric-8B gene. Ric-8B is a highly conserved protein that acts as a non-canonical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for heterotrimeric Gs/olf type subunits. We found that Ric-8B hypomorph embryos are smaller than their wild type littermates, fail to close the neural tube in the cephalic region and die during mid-embryogenesis. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that signaling pathways involving GPCRs and G proteins are dysregulated in the Ric-8B mutant embryos. Interestingly, this analysis also revealed an unexpected impairment of the mTOR signaling pathway.\\n\\nPhosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 is downregulated in the Ric-8B mutant embryos, indicating a decreased activity of mTORC2. In contrast, phosphorylation of S6, a downstream target of mTORC1, is unaltered. Knockdown of the endogenous Ric-8B gene in HEK293T cells leads to reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt at Ser 473, but not of S6, further supporting the selective involvement of Ric-8B in mTORC2 activity. Our results reveal a crucial role for Ric-8B in development and provide novel insights into the signals that regulate mTORC2 activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene inactivation in mice can be used to identify genes that are involved in important biological processes and that may contribute to disease. By using this approach, we found that the Ric-8B gene is essential for embryogenesis and for the normal development of the nervous system. Ric-8B mutant mouse embryos are smaller than their wild type littermates and show neural tube defects at the cranial region. This approach also allowed us to identify the biological pathways that are involved in the observed phenotypes, the G protein and mTORC2 signaling pathways. mTORC2 plays particular important roles also in the adult brain, and has been implicated in neurological disorders. Ric-8B is highly conserved in mammals, including humans. Our mutant mice provide a model to study the complex molecular and cellular processes underlying the interplay between Ric-8B and mTORC2 in neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "The majority of experiments investigating the immune response to gastrointestinal helminth infection use a single bolus infection. However, in situ individuals are repeatedly infected with low doses. Therefore, to model natural infection, mice were repeatedly infected (trickle infection) with low doses of Trichuris muris. Trickle infection resulted in the slow acquisition of immunity reflected by a gradual increase in worm burden followed by a partial expulsion. Flow cytometry revealed that the CD4+ T cell response shifted from Th1 dominated to Th2 dominated, which coincided with an increase in Type 2 cytokines. The development of resistance following trickle infection was associated with increased worm expulsion effector mechanisms including goblet cell hyperplasia, Muc5ac production and increased epithelial cell turn over. Depletion of CD4+ T cells reversed resistance confirming their importance in protective immunity following trickle infection. In contrast, depletion of group 2 innate lymphoid cells did not alter protective immunity. T. muris trickle infection resulted in a dysbiotic mircrobiota which began to recover alpha diversity following the development of resistance.\\n\\nThese data support trickle infection as a robust and informative model for analysis of immunity to chronic intestinal helminth infection more akin to that observed under natural infection conditions and confirms the importance of CD4+ T cell adaptive immunity in host protection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInfection with parasitic worms (helminths) is a considerable cause of morbidity in humans. Understanding how we respond to infection is crucial to developing novel therapies. Laboratory models of helminth infection have been a valuable tool in understanding fundamental immune responses to infection. However, typically an individual mouse will be infected with a large, single-dose of the parasite. This is in contrast to the natural scenario in which individuals will receive frequent low level exposures. What is unknown is how repeated infection alters the development of immunity to infection. We have developed a laboratory model to tackle this question. We infected mice with the model helminth Trichuris muris on a weekly basis and assessed a range of responses in comparison with a more traditional infection system. We found striking differences in the dynamics of the infection, the host immune response, and in changes to host gut microbial populations. Our study shows how resistance to helminth infection can develop over time in response to repeat infection, and provides a model system that better reflects human immunity to this parasite.",

    "abstract": "Accurate manipulation of metabolites in the monolignol biosynthetic pathway is a key step for controlling lignin content, structure, and other wood properties important to the bioenergy and biomaterial industries. A crucial component of this strategy is predicting how single and combinatorial knockdowns of monolignol specific gene transcripts influence the abundance of monolignol proteins, which are the driving mechanisms of monolignol biosynthesis. Computational models have been developed to estimate protein abundances from transcript perturbations of monolignol specific genes. The accuracy of these models, however, is hindered by the inability to capture indirect regulatory influences on other pathway genes. Here, we examine the manifestation of these indirect influences collectively on transgenic transcript and protein abundances, identifying putative indirect regulatory influences that occur when one or more specific monolignol pathway genes are perturbed. We created a computational model using sparse maximum likelihood to estimate the resulting monolignol transcript and protein abundances in transgenic Populus trichocarpa based on desired single or combinatorial knockdowns of specific monolignol genes. Using in-silico simulations of this model and root mean square error, we show that our model more accurately estimates transcript and protein abundances in differentiating xylem tissue when individual and families of monolignol genes were perturbed. This approach provides a useful computational tool for exploring the cascaded impact of single and combinatorial modifications of monolignol specific genes on lignin and other wood properties. Additionally, these results can be used to guide future experiments to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the indirect influences.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEngineering trees to have desirable lignin and wood traits is of significant interest to the bioenergy and biomaterial industries. Genetically modifying the expression of the genes that drive the monolignol biosynthetic pathway is a useful method for obtaining new traits. Modifying the expression of one gene affects not only the abundance of its encoded protein, but can also indirectly impact the amount of other transcripts and proteins. These proteins drive the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. Having an accurate representation of their abundances is key to understanding how lignin and wood traits are altered. We developed a computational model to estimate how the abundance of monolignol transcripts and proteins are changed when one or more monolignol genes are knocked down. Specifying only the abundances of the targeted genes as input, our model estimates how the levels of the other, untargeted, transcripts and proteins are altered. Our model captures indirect regulatory influences at the transcript and protein levels observed in experimental data. The model is an important addition to current models of lignin biosynthesis. By incorporating our approach into the existing models, we expect to improve our ability to explore how new combinations of gene knockdowns impact lignin and many other wood properties.",

The molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying the functions of the NALCN complex remain unclear. In a screen for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with defective avoidance response to the plant hormone methyl salicylate (MeSa), we isolated novel loss-of-function (lf) mutations in unc-80 and unc-79. unc-80 and unc-79 lf mutants exhibited defective MeSa avoidance but wild type-like responses to other odorants. Lf mutants of C. elegans nca/NALCN exhibited similar MeSa-specific avoidance defect, while lf mutants of the NALCN regulatory gene nlf-1 avoided MeSa like wild type. Using fluorescent transgenic animals, we identified a subset of unc-80-expressing neurons. Neuron-specific transgene rescue and knockdown experiments suggest that a subset of interneurons, primarily including AVA, AVE and AVG, might play a necessary and sufficient role in mediating unc-80 regulation of the MeSa avoidance. We found that unc-79 was expressed in neurons largely overlapping those expressing unc-80, which is supported by the rescue of unc-80(lf) defects using an unc-80 transgene driven by an unc-79 promoter. We also suggest that C. elegans locomotion responds more sensitively to the changes of expression levels of NALCN-related genes than the MeSa avoidance does. Together, our results identified NALCN-related genes as key regulators of the MeSa avoidance behavior and provided novel genetic and neuronal insights into the function of the NALCN channel complex.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNALCN (Na+ leak channel, non-selective) is a non-selective, voltage-independent cation channel that affects multiple neuronal activities and behaviors.

    "abstract": "Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) are conserved bacterial nanomachines that inject virulence proteins (effectors) into eukaryotic cells during infection. Due to their ability to introduce heterologous protein into human cells, these systems are being developed as therapeutic delivery devices. The T3SS assembles a translocon pore in the plasma membrane and then docks onto the pore. Docking activates effector secretion through the pore and into the host cytosol. Here, using Shigella flexneri, a model pathogen for the study of type 3 secretion, we determined the molecular mechanisms by which host intermediate filaments trigger docking and enable effector secretion. We show that the interaction of intermediate filaments with the translocon pore protein IpaC changed the pores conformation in a manner that was required for docking. Intermediate filaments repositioned residues of the Shigella pore protein IpaC that are located on the surface of the pore and in the pore channel. Restricting these conformational changes blocked docking in an intermediate filament-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that a host-induced conformational change to the pore enables T3SS docking and effector secretion, providing new mechanistic insight into the regulation of type 3 secretion.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe movement of bacterial proteins across membranes is essential for bacterial physiology and bacterial virulence. The type 3 secretion system moves bacterial virulence proteins from the inside of bacterial pathogens into human cells. To do so, the type 3 secretion system forms a pore in the plasma membrane of the target cell, attaches (docks) onto the pore, and delivers virulence proteins through the pore. Docking is essential for establishing a continuous channel from the inside of the bacteria to the inside of the human cell. What enables the type 3 secretion system to dock onto pores is not understood. We show that structural proteins in human cells, intermediate filament proteins, induce structural rearrangements to the type 3 secretion pore that trigger docking and that enable the subsequent delivery of virulence proteins into human cells. Due to the wide prevalence of type 3 secretion systems among human pathogens, these findings are likely to broadly enhance our understanding of type 3 secretion.",

Laboratory toxicity tests and greenhouse experiments were carried out using 13 acaricides to determine their efficacy and potential mechanisms of action.\\n\\nRESULTSAbamectin showed the highest efficacy against T. cinnabarinus female mites; its LC50 value was 0.18mg L-1. Pyridaben, cyhalothrin, veratrine, and carbosulfan showed reasonably high efficacy; their LC50 values were 2.69 mg L-1, 3.94 mg L-1, 5.98 mg L-1, and 6.75 mg L-1, respectively. Less effective were hexythiazox and bifenthrin, their LC50 values were 9.82 mg L-1 and 19.09 mg L-1, respectively. Other acaricides such as spirodiclofen, chlorantraniliprole, chlorfenapyr, spinosad, and bifenazate did not show good efficacy.

    "abstract": "Antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS) of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein are usually not broadly-reactive because their footprints are typically large and extend to nearby variable HA residues. Here, we identified several human H3N2 HA RBS-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were sensitive to substitutions in conventional antigenic sites and were not broadly-reactive. However, we also identified one H3N2 HA RBS-targeting mAb that was exceptionally broadly reactive despite being sensitive to substitutions in residues outside of the RBS. We determined that similar antibodies are present at measurable levels in the sera of some individuals but that they are inefficiently elicited by conventional vaccines. Our data indicate that some HA RBS-targeting antibodies can be surprisingly effective against variable viral strains even if they are somewhat sensitive to substitutions in HA residues adjacent to the RBS.",

Here, we asked how human cognate antigen-responsive CD8+ T cells and their receptors could be identified in unselected single-cell gene expression data. Single-cell RNA sequencing and qPCR of dye-labelled antigen-specific cells identified large gene sets that were congruently up- or downregulated in virus-responsive CD8+ T cells under different antigen presentation conditions. Combined expression of TNFRSF9, XCL1, XCL2, and CRTAM was the most distinct marker of virus-responsive cells on a single-cell level.

    "abstract": "Many listening abilities become more difficult in noisy environments, particularly following hearing loss. Sound localization can be disrupted even if target sounds are clearly audible and distinct from background noise. Since subjects locate sounds by comparing the input to the two ears, sound localization is also considerably impaired by unilateral hearing loss. Currently, however, it is unclear whether the effects of unilateral hearing loss are worsened by background noise. To address this, we measured sound localization abilities in the presence or absence of broadband background noise. Adult human subjects of either sex were tested with normal hearing or with a simulated hearing loss in one ear (earplug). To isolate the role of binaural processing, we tested subjects with narrowband target sounds. Surprisingly, we found that continuous background noise improved narrowband sound localization following simulated unilateral hearing loss. By contrast, we found the opposite effect under normal hearing conditions, with background noise producing illusory shifts in sound localization. Previous attempts to model these shifts are inconsistent with behavioural and neurophysiological data. However, here we found that a simple hemispheric model of sound localization provides an explanation for our results, and provides key hypotheses for future neurophysiological studies. Overall, our results suggest that continuous background noise may be used to improve sound localization under the right circumstances. This has important implications for real-world hearing, both in normal-hearing subjects and the hearing-impaired.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn noisy environments, many listening abilities become more difficult, even if target sounds are clearly audible. For example, background noise can produce illusory shifts in the perceived direction of target sounds. Because sound localization relies on the two ears working together, it is also distorted by a hearing loss in one ear. We might therefore expect background noise to worsen the effects of unilateral hearing loss. Surprisingly, we found the opposite, with background noise improving sound localization when we simulated a hearing loss in one ear. A simple hemispheric model of sound localization also helped explain the negative effects of background noise under normal hearing conditions. Overall, our results highlight the potential for using background noise to improve sound localization.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is a debilitating syndrome that is associated with reduced goal-directed behaviour. Although apathy is common and detrimental to prognosis in many neuropsychiatric diseases, its underlying mechanisms remain controversial. We propose a new model of apathy, in the context of Bayesian theories of brain function, whereby actions require predictions of their outcomes to be held with sufficient precision for  explaining away differences in sensory inputs. In this active inference model, apathy would result from reduced precision of prior beliefs about action outcomes. Healthy adults (N=47) performed a visuomotor task that independently manipulated physical effort and reward, and served to estimate the precision of priors. Participants perception of their performance was biased towards the target, which was accounted for by precise prior beliefs about action outcomes. Crucially, prior precision was negatively associated with apathy. The results support a Bayesian account of apathy, that could inform future studies of clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "One of the pivotal challenges of aging is to maintain independence in the activities of daily life. In order to adapt to changes in the environment, it is crucial to continuously process and accurately combine simultaneous input from different sensory systems, i.e., crossmodal integration.\\n\\nWith aging, performance decreases in multiple cognitive domains. The processing of sensory stimuli constitutes one of the key features of this deterioration. Age-related sensory impairments affect all modalities, substantiated by decreased acuity in visual, auditory or tactile detection tasks.\\n\\nHowever, whether this decline of sensory processing leads to impairments in crossmodal integration remains an unresolved question. While some researchers propose that crossmodal integration degrades with age, others suggest that it is conserved or even gains compensatory importance.\\n\\nTo address this question, we compared behavioral performance of older and young participants in a well-established crossmodal matching task, requiring the evaluation of congruency in simultaneously presented visual and tactile patterns. Older participants performed significantly worse than young controls in the crossmodal task when being stimulated at their individual unimodal visual and tactile perception thresholds. Performance increased with adjustment of stimulus intensities. This improvement was driven by better detection of congruent stimulus pairs (p<0.01), while detection of incongruent pairs was not significantly enhanced (p=0.12).\\n\\nThese results indicate that age-related impairments lead to poor performance in complex crossmodal scenarios and demanding cognitive tasks. Performance is enhanced when inputs to the visual and tactile systems are congruent. Congruency effects might therefore be used to develop strategies for cognitive training and neurological rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis, the pathological excess of fibroblast activity, is a significant health issue that hinders the function of many organs in the body, in some cases fatally. However, the severity of fibrosis-derived conditions depends on both the positioning of fibrotic affliction, and the microscopic patterning of fibroblast-deposited matrix proteins within afflicted regions. Variability in an individuals manifestation of a type of fibrosis is an important factor in explaining differences in symptoms, optimum treatment and prognosis, but a need for ex vivo procedures and a lack of experimental control over conflating factors has meant this variability remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a computational methodology for the generation of patterns of fibrosis microstructure, demonstrating the technique using histological images of four types of cardiac fibrosis. Our generator and automated tuning method prove flexible enough to capture each of these very distinct patterns, allowing for rapid generation of new realisations for high-throughput computational studies. We also demonstrate via simulation, using the generated fibrotic patterns, the importance of micro-scale variability by showing significant differences in electrophysiological impact even within a single class of fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is essential for both memory and navigation, but the neural codes underlying these functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the most prominent cell type in layers 2/3 (L2/3) of the granular RSC is a uniquely excitable, small pyramidal cell. These cells have a low rheobase (LR), high input resistance, lack of spike-frequency adaptation, and spike widths intermediate to those of neighboring fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons and regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons. LR cells are excitatory but rarely synapse onto neighboring neurons. Instead, L2/3 of RSC is an inhibition-dominated network with dense connectivity between FS cells and from FS to LR neurons. Biophysical models of LR but not RS cells precisely and continuously encode sustained input from afferent postsubicular head-direction cells. Thus, the unique intrinsic properties of LR neurons can support both the precision and persistence necessary to encode information over multiple timescales in the RSC.",

    "abstract": "Membranes have been used extensively for the purification and separation of biological species. A persistent challenge is the purification of species from concentrated feed solutions such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) from biological fluids. We investigated a new method to isolate micro- and nano-scale species termed tangential flow for analyte capture (TFAC), which is an extension of traditional tangential flow filtration (TFF). Initially, EV purification from plasma on ultrathin nanomembranes was compared between both normal flow filtration (NFF) and TFF. NFF resulted in rapid formation of a protein cake which completely obscured any captured EVs and also prevented further transport across the membrane. On the other hand, TFF showed capture of CD63 positive EVs with minimal contamination. We explored the use of TFF to capture target species over membrane pores, wash and then release in a physical process that does not rely upon affinity or chemical interactions. This process of TFAC was studied with model particles on both ultrathin nanomembranes and conventional thickness membranes (polycarbonate track-etch). Successful capture and release of model particles was observed using both membranes. Ultrathin nanomembranes showed higher efficiency of capture and release with significantly lower pressures indicating that ultrathin nanomembranes are well-suited for TFAC of delicate nanoscale particles such as EVs.",

Here, we have used several orthogonal approaches to map the subcellular distribution of PI, including localizing exogenous fluorescent PI, as well as detecting lipid conversion products of endogenous PI after acute chemogenetic activation of PI-specific phospholipase and 4-kinase. We report that PI is broadly distributed throughout intracellular membrane compartments. However, there is a surprising lack of PI in the plasma membrane compared to the PPIn. These experiments implicate regulation of PI supply to the plasma membrane, as opposed to regulation of PPIn-kinases, as crucial to the control of PPIn synthesis and function at the PM.\n\nSummaryZewe et al develop approaches to map the subcellular distribution of the major phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI), revealing that the lipid is present in most membranes except for plasma membrane, where it is mainly found as PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.",

    "abstract": "Well-regulated differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (MF) is critical for skin wound healing. Neoexpression of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), an established marker for MF differentiation, is driven by TGF{beta} receptor (TGF{beta}R)-mediated signaling. Hyaluronan (HA) and its receptor CD44 may also participate in this process. To further understand this process, primary mouse skin fibroblasts were isolated and treated in vitro with recombinant TGF-{beta}1 (rTGF-{beta}1) to induce -SMA expression. CD44 expression was also increased. Paradoxically, CD44 knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) led to increased -SMA expression and -SMA-containing stress fibers. Removal of extracellular HA or inhibition of HA synthesis had no effect on -SMA levels, suggesting a dispensable role for HA. Exploration of mechanisms linking CD44 knockdown to -SMA induction, using RNAi and chemical inhibitors, revealed a requirement for non-canonical TGF{beta}R signaling through p38MAPK. Decreased monomeric G-actin but increased filamentous F-actin following CD44 RNAi suggested a possible role for Myocardin-related Transcription Factor (MRTF), a known regulator of -SMA transcription and itself being regulated by G-actin binding. CD44 RNAi promoted nuclear accumulation of MRTF and the binding to its transcriptional cofactor, SRF. MRTF knockdown abrogated the increased -SMA expression caused by CD44 RNAi, suggesting that MRTF is required for CD44-mediated regulation of -SMA. Finally, chemical inhibition of p38MAPK reversed nuclear MRTF accumulation after rTGF-{beta}1 addition or CD44 RNAi, revealing a central requirement for p38MAPK in both cases. We concluded that CD44 regulates -SMA gene expression through cooperation between two intersecting signaling pathways, one mediated by G-actin/MRTF and the other via TGF{beta}R/p38MAPK.",

Previous studies have indicated that the modularity of this system is affected by ligand-induced differences in the stability of the dimerized receptor in a process known as \"Biased signaling\". However, this hypothesis has not been explored using single-mutant ligands thus far. Herein, we developed a new approach to identify residues responsible for functional divergence combining the conservation and co-evolution information of ortholog and paralog genes encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand. Then, we mutated these residues and assessed the mutants effects on the receptor by employing a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and biochemical techniques. Although the EGF mutants had comparable binding affinities to the wild type ligand for EGFR, the EGF mutants induced a different phosphorylation and cell growth pattern in multiple cell lines. The MD simulations of the EGF mutants show a long-range effect on the receptor dimer interface. For the first time in this study, a single mutation in EGF is shown to be enough to alter the activation of the pathway at the cellular level. These results also support the theory of biased signaling in the tyrosine kinase receptor system and demonstrate a promising new way to study ligand-receptor interactions.",

Here we report the use of super-resolution imaging with the K3 direct electron detector to produce super-resolution single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions significantly surpassing the physical Nyquist limit. We also present a comparative analysis of a sample imaged at four different magnifications. This analysis demonstrates that lower magnifications can be beneficial, despite the loss of higher resolution signal, due to the increased particle numbers imaged.

    "abstract": "Primary cilia (PC) are organelles necessary for proper implementation of developmental and homeostasis processes. To initiate their assembly, coordinated actions of multiple proteins are needed. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key player in the cilium assembly pathway, controlling final step of cilia initiation. The function of TTBK2 in ciliogenesisis is critically dependent on its kinase activity, however, precise mechanism of TTBK2 action is so far incompletely understood, due to very limited information about its relevant substrates. In this study we identify CEP83, CEP89, CCDC92, Rabin8 and DVL3 as substrates of TTBK2 kinase activity. Further, we characterise a set of phosphosites of the newly identified substrates and CEP164, induced by TTBK2 in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, we further show that identified TTBK2 phosphosites and consensus sequence delineated from those are distinct from motifs previously assigned to TTBK2. Finally, we address functional relevance of selected phosphorylations of CEP164 and provide evidence that the examined TTBK2-induced phosphorylations of CEP164 are relevant for the process of cilia formation. In summary, our work provides important insight into substrates-TTBK2 kinase relationship and suggests that phosphorylation of substrates on multiple sites by TTBK2 is probably involved in the control of ciliogenesis in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Animals are characterized by their movement, and their tissues are continuously subjected to dynamic force loading while they crawl, walk, run or swim1. Tissue mechanics fundamentally determine the ecological niches that can be endured by a living organism2. While epithelial tissues provide an important barrier function in animals, they are subjected to extreme strains during day to day physiological activities, such as breathing1, feeding3, and defense response4. How-ever, failure or inability to withstand to these extreme strains can result in epithelial fractures5, 6 and associated diseases7, 8. From a materials science perspective, how properties of living cells and their interactions prescribe larger scale tissue rheology and adaptive response in dynamic force landscapes remains an important frontier9. Motivated by pushing tissues to the limits of their integrity, we carry out a multi-modal study of a simple yet highly dynamic organism, the Trichoplax Adhaerens10-12, across four orders of magnitude in length (1 {micro}m to 10 mm), and six orders in time (0.1 sec to 10 hours). We report the discovery of abrupt, bulk epithelial tissue fractures ([~]10 sec) induced by the organisms own motility. Coupled with rapid healing ([~]10 min), this discovery accounts for dramatic shape change and physiological asexual division in this early-divergent metazoan. We generalize our understanding of this phenomena by codifying it in a heuristic model, highlighting the fundamental questions underlying the debonding/bonding criterion in a soft-active-living material by evoking the concept of an  epithelial alloy. Using a suite of quantitative experimental and numerical techniques, we demonstrate a force-driven ductile to brittle material transition governing the morphodynamics of tissues pushed to the edge of rupture. This work contributes to an important discussion at the core of developmental biology13-17, with important applications to an emerging paradigm in materials and tissue engineering5, 18-20, wound healing and medicine8, 21, 22.",

    "abstract": "Ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel required for skeletal muscle contraction. RyR1 is co-regulated by multiple activators - Ca2+, ATP and caffeine (CFF), yet the mechanism of co-regulation and the action synergy of these activators is unknown. Here, we report the detailed network of allosteric connections between the three ligand sites and the pore region in (i) Ca2+ bound - closed, (ii) ATP/CFF bound - closed, (iii) Ca2+/ATP/CFF bound - closed and (iv) Ca2+/ATP/CFF bound - open RyR1 states. We find that two dominant paths mediate the communication between the Ca2+ binding site and pore region in Ca2+-only state. ATP/CFF-only occupied - closed RyR1 has two additional paths with CFF-but not ATP-occupied path using part of the closed Ca2+-only pathway. In the presence of Ca2+, ATP and CFF, major differences between the open and closed states are identified with both using part of the paths of the closed Ca2+-only and ATP/CFF-only states. We find that the three activators Ca2+, ATP, and CFF propagate their effects to the pore region through a network of partially overlapping pathways. Such coordination of allosteric pathway underlies the molecular basis of synergy of channel regulation by multiple activators.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceRyRs are a group of Ca2+ channels that bind to several endogenous modulators and regulate Ca2+ release through closed-to-open gating transition. Despite the high-resolution structural data available for RyR1, the allosteric mechanism of RyR1 gating remains elusive. In this study, we employed graph-theoretical approach to demonstrate the allosteric network of synergistic interaction among various activators in RyR1. To our knowledge, for the first time we were able to identify the co-regulation among ligand sites in RyR1 to regulate the closed-to-open gating transition. The explored allosteric coupling in RyR1 may assist in designing advanced therapeutics for several debilitating diseases. Our findings in this study will assist to design new strategies for controlled allosteric regulation of RyR1 functionality in future.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeleton is a composite network of three types of protein filaments, among which in-termediate filaments (IFs) are the most extensible ones. Two very important IFs are keratin and vimentin, which have similar molecular architectures, but different mechanical behaviors. Here we compare the mechanical response of single keratin and vimentin filaments using optical tweezers. We show that the mechanics of vimentin strongly depends on the ionic strength of the buffer and that its force-strain curve suggests a high degree of cooperativity between subunits. Indeed, a computational model indicates that in contrast to keratin, vimentin is characterized by strong lateral subunit coupling of its charged monomers during unfolding of -helices. We conclude that cells can tune their mechanics by differential use of keratin versus vimentin.",

    "abstract": "The first cell fate decisions in the developing fly embryo are made very rapidly: hunchback genes decide in a few minutes whether a given nucleus follows the anterior or the posterior developmental blueprint by reading out the positional information encoded in the Bicoid morphogen. This developmental system constitutes a prototypical instance of the broad spectrum of regulatory decision processes that combine speed and accuracy. Traditional arguments based on fixed-time sampling of Bicoid concentration indicate that an accurate readout is not possible within the short times observed experimentally. This raises the general issue of how speed-accuracy tradeoffs are achieved. Here, we compare fixed-time sampling strategies to decisions made on-the-fly, which are based on updating and comparing the likelihoods of being at an anterior or a posterior location. We found that these more efficient schemes can complete reliable cell fate decisions even within the very short embryological timescales. We discuss the influence of promoter architectures on the mean decision time and decision error rate and present concrete promoter architectures that allow for the fast readout of the morphogen. Lastly, we formulate explicit predictions for new experiments involving Bicoid mutants.",

    "abstract": "SummarySegmentation of single cells in microscopy images is one of the major challenges in computational biology. It is the first step of most bioimage analysis tasks, and essential to create training sets for more advanced deep learning approaches. Here, we propose 3D-Cell-Annotator to solve this task using 3D active surfaces together with shape descriptors as prior information in a fully- and semi-automated fashion. The software uses the convenient 3D interface of the widely used Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK). Results on 3D biological structures (e.g. spheroids, organoids, embryos) show that the precision of the segmentation reaches the level of a human expert.\\n\\nAvailability and implementation3D-Cell-Annotator is implemented in CUDA/C++ as a patch for the segmentation module of MITK. The 3D-Cell-Annotator enabled MITK distribution can be downloaded at: www.3D-cell-annotator.org. It works under Windows 64-bit systems and recent Linux distributions even on a consumer level laptop with a CUDA-enabled video card using recent NVIDIA drivers.\\n\\nContactsfilippo.piccinini@irst.emr.it and horvath.peter@brc.mta.hu",
