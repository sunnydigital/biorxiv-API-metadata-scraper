    "abstract": "Inferring missing links or predicting future ones based on the currently observed network is known as link prediction, which has tremendous real-world applications in biomedicine1-3, e-commerce4, social media5 and criminal intelligence6. Numerous methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem7-9. Yet, many of these existing methods are designed for undirected networks only. Moreover, most methods are based on domain-specific heuristics10, and hence their performances differ greatly for networks from different domains. Here we developed a new link prediction method based on deep generative models11 in machine learning. This method does not rely on any domain-specific heuristic and works for general undirected or directed complex networks. Our key idea is to represent the adjacency matrix of a network as an image and then learn hierarchical feature representations of the image by training a deep generative model. Those features correspond to structural patterns in the network at different scales, from small subgraphs to mesoscopic communities12. Conceptually, taking into account structural patterns at different scales all together should outperform any domain-specific heuristics that typically focus on structural patterns at a particular scale. Indeed, when applied to various real-world networks from different domains13-17, our method shows overall superior performance against existing methods. Moreover, it can be easily parallelized by splitting a large network into several small subnetworks and then perform link prediction for each subnetwork in parallel. Our results imply that deep learning techniques can be effectively applied to complex networks and solve the classical link prediction problem with robust and superior performance.\n\nSummaryWe propose a new link prediction method based on deep generative models.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is the insufficiency of oxygen in the cell, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are central regulators of oxygen homeostasis. In order to obtain functional insights into the hypoxic response in a data-driven way, we attempted a meta-analysis of the RNA-seq data from the hypoxic transcriptomes archived in public databases. In view of methodological variability of archived data in the databases, we first manually curated RNA-seq data from appropriate pairs of transcriptomes before and after hypoxic stress. These included 128 human and 52 murine transcriptome pairs. We classified the results of experiments for each gene into three categories: upregulated, downregulated, and unchanged. Hypoxic transcriptomes were then compared between humans and mice to identify common hypoxia-responsive genes. In addition, meta-analyzed hypoxic transcriptome data were integrated with public ChIP-seq data on the known human HIFs HIF-1 and HIF-2 to provide insights into hypoxia-responsive pathways involving direct transcription factor binding. This study provides a useful resource for hypoxia research. It also demonstrates the potential of a meta-analysis approach to public gene expression databases for selecting candidate genes from gene expression profiles generated under various experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Most tumours exhibit significant heterogeneity and are best described as communities of cellular populations competing for resources. Growing experimental evidence also suggests, however, that cooperation between cancer clones is important as well for the maintenance of tumour heterogeneity and tumour progression. However, a role for cell communication during the earliest steps in oncogenesis is not well characterised despite its vital importance in normal tissue and clinically manifest tumours. By modelling the interaction between the mutational process and cell-to-cell communication in three-dimensional tissue architecture, we show that non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of carcinogenesis could support and accelerate pre-cancerous clonal expansion through the cooperation of different, non- or partially- transformed mutants. We predict the existence of a  cell-autonomous time-horizon, a time before which cooperation between cell-to-cell communication and DNA mutations might be one of the most fundamental forces shaping the early stages of oncogenesis. The understanding of this process could shed new light on the mechanisms leading to clinically manifest cancers.",

    "abstract": "The TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors mediate diverse responses to the plant hormone auxin. The Arabidopsis genome encodes six TIR1/AFB proteins representing three of the four clades that were established prior to angiosperm radiation. To determine the role of these proteins in plant development we performed an extensive genetic analysis involving the generation and characterization of all possible multiply mutant lines. We find that loss of all six TIR1/AFB proteins results in defects in embryogenesis as early as the 8-cell stage, and possibly earlier. Mutant embryos progress but exhibit frequent cell division errors followed by proliferation of the suspensor, and eventually seed abortion. Despite this dramatic phenotype, a single wild-type allele of TIR1 or AFB2 is sufficient to support growth throughout plant development. Further, gametophytic expression of the TIR1/AFB genes is not essential for development of the male or female gametophyte. Our analysis reveals extensive functional overlap between even the most distantly related TIR1/AFB genes except for AFB1. Surprisingly, the AFB1 protein has a specialized function in rapid auxin-dependent inhibition of root growth and early phase of root gravitropism. This activity may be related to a difference in subcellular localization compared to the other members of the family.",

    "abstract": "SetupMalaria Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) species contains multiple strains with different immunogenic profiles, and expressed phenotypes. These strains circulate in host populations via mosquito transmission, and interact (compete, cooperate) on two levels: within - host (via cross-reactive immunity), and in host populations. Both factors, host immunity and transmission environment, play important part in evolution and selection.\n\nConventional population-based models of malaria have limited capacity to accommodate parasite-immune dynamics within-host and strain diversity. Here we developed an in-host model for multi-strain malaria based on its genetic (immunogenic) makeup, which accounts for essential parasite-immune biology. The model allows efficient simulations of mixed-strain infections in individual hosts and in host ensembles over multiple transmission cycles. We use it to explore evolutionary implications (competition, selection) of malaria quasi-species, driven by host immunity and transmission intensity.\n\nResultsThe key  selectable trait within-host is strain transmissibility (TP), which measures cumulative odds of mosquito infection by a given strain over infection history. Here we adopt it to explore evolutionary implications of parasite-immune interactions on different time scales and transmission environments. Specifically, we explore (i) primary strain selection in naive host ensembles based on TP-fitness; (ii) evolution and selection of mixed multi-strain systems over multiple transmission cycles.\n\nOn level (i) different strain mixtures competed in multiple hosts, to identify  most fit (highly transmissible) types. A key observation of (i) was fitness-cost of in-host competition, i.e. statistical TP-loss determined by multiplicity of infection (number of competing strains), and strain genotype (immunogenic profile). The most-fit strains maintained their high TP-values regardless of competing environment.\n\nWe selected them for step (ii), to explore long-term evolution over multiple transmission cycles. Our analysis revealed peculiar features of evolution: success within-host (step (i)) did not guarantee strain survival over multiple cycles. Indeed, the latter was strongly associated with cooperative behavior, i.e. co-existence of a given strain in suitable mixtures, in multiple hosts over many generations. We examined the resulting population structure of evolving strains, in terms of their immune cross-reactivity. Overall, our results were consistent with predictions of strain theory [1-4], [5, 6]. Strain theory predicts that cross-reacting parasite strains in host population should organize themselves into  non-overlapping (immunogenically disjunct) clusters. In our case, no strict  immune separation arises, but cross-reactivity is lost over multiple cycles, and surviving clusters are  nearly disjunct. Such weakly overlapping clusters (cooperating cliques) persisted over long (evolutionary) periods. Specifically, each clique was found to possess a core node -highly cooperative persistent strain, carrying a subordinate (transient) cluster.\n\nOur results shed new light on relative importance of competitive vs. cooperative behavior, and multi-level organization of genetically structured parasite system. They could have implications for malaria control and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Measures of brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Electroencephalography (EEG), two complementary modalities, are ground solutions in the context of neuro-feedback (NF) mechanisms for brain rehabilitation protocols. While NF-EEG (real-time neurofeedback scores computed from EEG signals) have been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (real-time neurofeedback scores computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using simultaneously fMRI and EEG for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, real-time neurofeedback scores computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising to devise brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors steaming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improve the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions, compared to classical NF-EEG scores.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and pollution are some of the greatest anthropogenic threats to wild animals. Transgenerational plasticity - when parental exposure to environmental stress leads to changes in offspring phenotype - has been recently highlighted as a potential mechanism to respond to various environmental and anthropogenic changes across taxa. Transgenerational effects may be mediated via multiple mechanisms, such as transfer of maternal hormones to eggs/fetus. However, sources of variation in hormone transfer are poorly understood in fish, and thus the first step is to characterize whether environmental challenges alter transfer of maternal hormones to eggs. To this end, we explored the genetic and environmental variation (in response to temperature and endocrine disrupting copper) in maternal thyroid hormone (TH), transfer to offspring in a common fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using multiple approaches: (i) We compared ovarian TH levels among six populations across a wide geographical range in the Baltic Sea, including two populations at high water temperature areas (discharge water areas of nuclear power plants) and we experimentally exposed fish to (ii) environmentally relevant heat stress and (iii) copper for 7 days. We found that populations did not differ in intraovarian TH levels, and short-term heat stress did not influence intraovarian TH levels. However, copper exposure increased both T4 and T3 levels in ovaries. The next step would be to evaluate if such alterations would lead to changes in offspring phenotype.\n\nCapsule: We show that experimental copper exposure, but not heat stress (experimental or among-population variation), leads to elevated ovarian thyroid hormone levels in sticklebacks.",

    "abstract": "Local field potential oscillations reflect temporally coordinated neuronal ensembles-- coupling distant brain regions, gating processing windows, and providing a reference for spike timing-based codes. In phase amplitude coupling (PAC), the amplitude of the envelope of a faster oscillation is larger within a phase window of a slower carrier wave. Here, we characterized PAC, and the related theta phase-referenced high gamma and beta power (PRP), in the olfactory bulb of mice learning to discriminate odorants. PAC changes throughout learning, and odorant-elicited changes in PRP increase for rewarded and decrease for unrewarded odorants. Contextual odorant identity (is the odorant rewarded?) can be decoded from peak PRP in animals proficient in odorant discrimination, but not in naive mice. As the animal learns to discriminate the odorants the dimensionality of PRP decreases. Therefore, modulation of phase-referenced chunking of information in the course of learning plays a role in early sensory processing in olfaction.\n\nSignificanceEarly processing of olfactory information takes place in circuits undergoing slow frequency theta oscillations generated by the interplay of olfactory input modulated by sniffing and centrifugal feedback from downstream brain areas. Studies in the hippocampus and cortex suggest that different information \"chunks\" are conveyed at different phases of the theta oscillation. Here we show that in the olfactory bulb, the first processing station in the olfactory system, the amplitude of high frequency gamma oscillations encodes for information on whether an odorant is rewarded when it is observed at the peak phase of the theta oscillation. Furthermore, encoding of information by the theta phase-referenced gamma oscillations becomes more accurate as the animal learns to differentiate two odorants.",

The graph notation is used to represent a network, where nodes are identical biological units (e.g. brain regions) shared across subjects and edge-variables indicate the strengths of interactive relationships between nodes. Edge-variables vary across subjects and may be associated with covariates of interest. The statistical inference for multivariate edge-variables is challenging because both localized inference on individual edges and the joint inference of a combinatorial of edges (network-level) are desired. Different from conventional multivariate variables (e.g. omics data), the inference of a combinatorial of edges is closely linked with network topology and graph combinatorics. We propose a novel objective function with [l]0 norm regularization to robustly capture subgraphs/subnetworks from the whole brain connectome and thus reveal the latent network topology of phenotype-related edges. Our statistical inferential procedure and theories are constructed based on graph combinatorics. We apply the proposed approach to a brain connectome study to identify latent brain functional subnetworks that are associated with schizophrenia and verify the findings using an independent replicate data set. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with remarkably increased replicability.",

This study assessed differences in white matter (WM) microstructure between HD patients and controls, and tested whether drumming training stimulates WM remodelling in HD. Furthermore, it examined whether training-induced microstructural changes are related to improvements in motor and cognitive function.\n\nMethodsParticipants undertook two months of drumming exercises. Working memory and executive function were assessed before and after training. Changes in WM microstructure were investigated with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI)-based metrics, the restricted diffusion signal fraction (Fr) from the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) and the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging. WM pathways linking the putamen and the supplementary motor area (SMA-Putamen), and three segments of the corpus callosum (CCI, CCII, CCIII) were studied using deterministic tractography. Baseline MPF differences between patients and controls were assessed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).\n\nResultsMPF was reduced in HD patients compared to controls in the mid-section of the CC in HD subjects at baseline, while a significantly greater change in MPF was detected in HD patients relative to controls in the CCII, CCIII, and the right SMA-putamen post-training. Further, although patients improved their drumming and executive function performance, such improvements did not correlate with microstructural changes.\n\nConclusionsIncreased MPF suggests training-induced myelin changes in HD.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of many medications from multiple therapeutic classes. Associations between patterns of variants (known as haplotypes) in the genes encoding them (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) and enzyme activities are well described. The genes in fact comprise 21% of biomarkers in drug labels. Despite this, genotyping is not common, partly attributable to its challenging nature (CYP2D6 having >100 haplotypes, including those with sequence from an adjacent pseudogene, and gene duplications). We cross-validated different methodologies for identifying haplotypes in these genes against each other.\n\nMethodsNinety-two samples with a variety of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes according to prior AmpliChip CYP450 and TaqMan CYP2C19*17 data were selected from the Genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP) study. Genotyping was performed with TaqMan copy number variant (CNV) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis, the next generation sequencing-based Ion S5 AmpliSeq Pharmacogenomics Panel, PharmacoScan, long-range polymerase chain reaction (L-PCR) followed by amplicon analysis, and Agena for CYP2C19. Variant pattern to haplotype translation was automated.\n\nResultsThe inter-platform concordance for CYP2C19 was high (up to 100% for available data). For CYP2D6, the IonS5-PharmacoScan concordance was 94% for a range of variants tested apart from those with at least one extra copy of a CYP2D6 gene (occurring at a frequency of 3.8%, 33/853), or those with substantial sequence derived from pseudogene, known as hybrids (3%, 26/853).\n\nConclusionsInter-platform concordance for CYP2C19 was high, and, moreover, the Ion S5 and PharmacoScan data were 100% concordant with that from a TaqMan CYP2C19*2 assay. We have also demonstrated feasibility of using an NGS platform for genotyping CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, with automated data interpretation methodology. This points the way to a method of making CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping more readily accessible.",

    "abstract": "The ability to efficiently query genomic variants from thousands of samples is critical to achieving the full potential of many medical and scientific applications such as personalized medicine. Performing variant queries based on coordinates in the reference or sample sequences is at the core of these applications. Efficiently supporting variant queries across thousands of samples is computationally challenging. Most solutions only support queries based on the reference coordinates and the ones that support queries based on coordinates across multiple samples do not scale to data containing more than a few thousand samples. We present VariantStore, a system for efficiently indexing and querying genomic variants and their sequences in either the reference or sample-specific coordinate systems. We show the scalability of VariantStore by indexing genomic variants from the TCGA-BRCA project containing 8640 samples and 5M variants in 4 Hrs and the 1000 genomes project containing 2500 samples and 924M variants in 3 Hrs. Querying for variants in a gene takes between 0.002 - 3 seconds using memory only 10% of the size of the full representation.",

Whole exome (WES) and targeted sequencing of several independent cohorts of CMML patients, comparing dysplastic (dCMML) to proliferative (pCMML) CMML, as well as paired chronic phase disease and acute leukemic transformation (LT), associate acquisition of oncogenic RAS pathway mutations, the most common being NRASG12D, with aggressive disease and with disease progression. Using patient derived progenitor colony assays and a NRASG12D-Vav-Cre mouse model, we further demonstrate the role of mutant RAS signaling in driving and maintaining pCMML phenotype. RNA-sequencing links RAS pathway mutations with an increased expression of genes encoding the mitotic checkpoint kinases PLK1 and WEE1. Further, we dmeoinstrated that non-mutated lysine methyltransferase KMT2A (MLL1) acts as mediator of NRAS-induced PLK1 and WEE1 expression. Finally, we demonstrate the translational value of our findings by showing that pharmacological PLK1 inhibition decreases monocytosis and hepatosplenomegaly while improving hematopoiesis in RAS mutant patient-derived xenografts. Hence, we define severe CMML as oncogenic RAS pathway-enriched malignancies, with a unique gene expression profile regulated by KMT2A, amenable to therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "We address the effect of population structure on key properties of the Ewens sampling formula. We use our previously-introduced inductive method for determining exact allele frequency spectrum (AFS) probabilities under the infinite-allele model of mutation and population structure for samples of arbitrary size. Fundamental to the sampling distribution is the novel-allele probability, the probability that given the pattern of variation in the present sample, the next gene sampled belongs to an as-yet-unobserved allelic class. Unlike the case for panmictic populations, the novel-allele probability depends on the AFS of the present sample. We derive a recursion that directly provides the marginal novel-allele probability across AFSs, obviating the need first to determine the probability of each AFS. Our explorations suggest that the marginal novel-allele probability tends to be greater for initial samples comprising fewer alleles and for sampling configurations in which the next-observed gene derives from a deme different from that of the majority of the present sample. Comparison to the efficient importance sampling proposals developed by De Iorio and Griffiths and colleagues indicates that their approximation for the novel-allele probability generally agrees with the true marginal, although it may tend to overestimate the marginal in cases in which the novel-allele probability is high and migration rates are low.",

    "abstract": "The genome of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is integrated within the nuclear genome of about 1% of humans, but how this came about is not clear. HHV-6 integrates into telomeres, and this has recently been associated with polymorphisms affecting MOV10L1. MOV10L1 is located on the subtelomere of chromosome 22q (chr22q) and is required to make PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs block integration of transposons in the germline, so piRNA-mediated repression of HHV-6 integration has been suspected. Whether integrated HHV-6 can reactive into an infectious virus is also uncertain. In vitro, recombination of the viral genome along its terminal direct repeats (DRs) leads to excision from the telomere and viral reactivation, but the expected single DR \"scar\" has not been described in vivo. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 13,040 subjects, including 7,485 from Japan. We found an association between integrated HHV-6 and polymorphisms on chr22q in Japanese subjects. However, association with the reported MOV10L1 polymorphism was driven by physical linkage to a single ancient endogenous HHV-6A variant integrated into the telomere of chr22q in East Asians. We resolved the junction of the human chromosome with this viral genome using long read sequencing. Unexpectedly, an HHV-6B variant has also endogenized in chr22q; two endogenous HHV-6 variants at this locus thus account for 72% of all integrated HHV-6 in Japan. We also report human genomes carrying only one portion of the HHV-6B genome, a single DR, supporting in vivo excision and viral reactivation. Using WGS data from North American families, we show that the incidence of HHV-6 integration into the germline is lower than its prevalence, and that integrated HHV-6 is not associated with the reported variant in MOV10L1. Together these results explain the recently reported association between integrated HHV-6 and MOV10L1/piRNAs, suggest exaptation of HHV-6 in its coevolution with human chr22q, and clarify the evolution and risk of reactivation of the only intact non-retroviral genome known to be present in human germlines.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n\nHuman herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infects most people during childhood, usually only causing fever and rash. Reactivation of HHV-6 has been linked to a number of neurological diseases including encephalitis, Alzheimers disease and multiple sclerosis. However, about 1% of people are born with the HHV-6 genome present within their genome, included in the end \"cap\" of one of their 46 chromosomes. Little is known about how and when HHV-6 genomes entered human genomes, whether or not they still do, and whether or not this poses risk for virus reactivation. We looked for HHV-6 in genome sequences from over 13,000 people. Most HHV-6 variants present in human genomes have been co-evolving with human chromosomes for many generations, and new integration events are rare. Surprisingly, in almost three fourths of Japanese people with HHV-6 in their genome, HHV-6 integrated in the same end of the same chromosome - 22q. Persistence of the HHV-6 genome within the short \"cap\" that preserves the end of chromosome 22q suggests that the integrated viral sequence may have taken on a useful function for this chromosome. We also found that some human genomes harbor only one part of the HHV-6 genome. This part is the same part that remains after experimental viral reactivation, during which most of the virus is cut out of the genome. This warrants assessment of the risk that integration of HHV-6 into inherited human genomes is not irreversible, and possibly leads to production of infectious virus.",

We performed a microbiome genome-wide association study to identify host genetic variants associated with gut microbiome in a Chinese population with 1475 participants. We then conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the potential causal associations between gut microbiome and human complex diseases. We found that Saccharibacteria (also known as TM7 phylum) could potentially improve renal function by affecting renal function biomarkers (i.e., creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate). In contrast, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer, as predicted by the host genetics, had potential causal effect on gut microbiome. Further disease-microbiome feature analysis suggested that gut microbiome features revealed novel relationship among human complex diseases. These results suggest that different human complex diseases share common and distinct gut microbiome features, which may help re-shape our understanding about the disease etiology in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe neurological mechanisms of the disease process of obstructive sleep apnea, the second most frequent sleep disorder, remain unclear whilst its links with several major neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and even Alzheimers disorder, are increasingly recognised. A radical theory, that inflammation in the brain may underlie certain phenotypes of many of these disorders, has been proposed, and the microglial TLR2 system may serve as an important crossroad at the borderlands of several pathogenesis. This study undertook to investigate whether a neuroinflammatory response occurs under conditions of OSA, and whether it might be related to a modulated response due to TLR2 functionality in an established rodent model of OSA.\n\nMethodsThe effects of three weeks exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia were monitored in mice with or without functional TLR2 (C57BL/6-Tyrc-Brd-Tg(Tlr2-luc/gfp)Kri/Gaj; TLR2-/-, C57BL/6-Tlr2tm1Kir), that were investigated by multimodal in vivo and ex vivo imaging, combining magnetic resonance and bioluminescence imaging and a variety of functional tests.\n\nResultsAn acute neuroinflammatory response was demonstrated following the three days in the basal forebrain of mice, and more chronically in other parts of the frontal cortex. Adaptive changes in specific neurocircuitry were demonstrated, with significant links to agitated (mal)adaptive behaviour under episodes of stress, and an increased ability to gain weight.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that microglial activation and an innate immune response might be the missing link underlying the pathogenesis of well known structural, psychologic and metabolic changes experienced by some patients with OSA.",

    "abstract": "Among transporters, the SLC22 family is emerging as a central hub of endogenous physiology. The family consists of organic anion transporters (OATs), organic cation transporters (OCTs) and zwitterion transporters (OCTNs). Despite being known as \"drug\" transporters, these multi-specific, oligo-specific, and relatively mono-specific transporters facilitate the movement of metabolites and key signaling molecules. An in-depth reanalysis supports a reassignment of these proteins into eight functional subgroups with four new subgroups arising from the previously defined OAT subclade. These OAT subgroups are: OATS1 (SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC22A20), OATS2 (SLC22A7), OATS3 (SLC22A11, SLC22A12, and Slc22a22), and OATS4 (SLC22A9, SLC22A10, SLC22A24, and SLC22A25). We propose merging the OCTN (SLC22A4, SLC22A5, and Slc22a21) and OCT-related (SLC22A15 and SLC22A16) subclades into the OCTN/OCTN-related subgroup. Functional support for the eight subgroups comes from network analysis of data from GWAS, in vivo models, and in vitro assays. These data emphasize shared substrate specificity of SLC22 transporters for characteristic metabolites such as prostaglandins, uric acid, carnitine, creatinine, and estrone sulfate. Some important subgroup associations include: OATS1 with metabolites, signaling molecules, uremic toxins and odorants, OATS2 with cyclic nucleotides, OATS3 with uric acid, OATS4 with conjugated sex hormones, particularly etiocholanolone glucuronide, OCT with monoamine neurotransmitters, and OCTN/OCTN-related with ergothioneine and carnitine derivatives. The OAT-like and OAT-related subgroups remain understudied and therefore do not have assigned functionality. Relatedness within subgroups is supported by multiple sequence alignments, evolutionarily conserved protein motifs, genomic localization, and tissue expression. We also highlight low level sequence similarity of SLC22 members with other non-transport proteins. Our data suggest that the SLC22 family can work among itself, as well as with other transporters and enzymes, to optimize levels of numerous metabolites and signaling molecules, as proposed by the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory.",

    "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disorder of unknown etiology, and diagnosis of the disease is largely based on clinical symptoms. We hypothesized that immunological disruption is the major driver of this disease and analyzed a large cohort of ME/CFS patient or control blood samples for differences in T cell subset frequencies and functions. We found that the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells and the proportion of CD8+ effector memory T cells were increased, whereas NK cells were reduced in ME/CFS patients younger than 50 years old compared to a healthy control group. Remarkably, major differences were observed in Th1, Th2, Th17 and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) T cell subset functions across all ages of patients compared to healthy subjects. While CCR6+ Th17 cells in ME/CFS secreted less IL-17 compared to controls, their overall frequency was higher. Similarly, MAIT cells from patients secreted lower IFN{gamma}, GranzymeA and IL-17 upon activation. Together, these findings suggest chronic stimulation of these T cell populations in ME/CFS patients. In contrast, the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which control excessive immune activation, was higher in ME/CFS patients. Finally, using a machine learning algorithm called random forest, we determined that the set of T cell parameters analyzed could identify more than 90% of the subjects in the ME/CFS cohort as patients (93% true positive rate or sensitivity). In conclusion, these multiple and major perturbations or dysfunctions in T cell subsets in ME/CFS patients suggest potential chronic infections or microbiome dysbiosis. These findings also have implications for development of ME/CFS specific immune biomarkers and reveal potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation belong to two of the most important pathological factors in multiple neurological disorders. However, the effect of mitochondrial damage of microglia on microglial activation under pathological conditions has remained unclear. In our current study, we used BV2 microglia as a cellular model to determine the effects of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors on LPS-induced inflammatory responses of microglia. We found that all of the three mitochondrial ETC inhibitors, including rotenone, sodium azide and antimycin A, significantly inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory responses of the microglia, assessed by determinations of the protein or mRNA levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, TNF-, iNOS and COX2. Nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B p65 subunit does not appear to play an important role in the mitochondrial ETC inhibition-produced suppression of microglial activation. Instead, our study found that the mitochondrial ETC inhibitors significantly attenuated not only the LPS-induced increase in the TREM1 levels - an amplifier of inflammatory process, but also the LPS-induced increase in the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 / STAT3. In summary, our study has suggested that mitochondrial ETC inhibition of microglia can lead to suppression of LPS-induced microglial activation, which may be mediated by the inhibitory effects of mitochondrial ETC inhibition on the LPS-induced increases in the level of TREM1 and the ratio of p-STAT3 / STAT3. These findings have provided valuable information for elucidating the relationships between mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation in multiple neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The systematic identification of genetic events driving cellular transformation and tumor progression in the absence of a highly recurrent oncogenic driver mutation is a challenge in cutaneous oncology. In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), the high UV-induced mutational burden poses a hurdle to achieve a complete molecular landscape of this disease. Here, we utilized the Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis system to statistically define drivers of keratinocyte transformation and cuSCC progression in vivo in the absence of UV-IR, and identified both known tumor suppressor genes and novel oncogenic drivers of cuSCC. Functional analysis confirms an oncogenic role for the ZMIZ genes, and tumor suppressive roles for KMT2C, CREBBP and NCOA2, in the initiation or progression of human cuSCC. Taken together, our in vivo screen demonstrates an extremely heterogeneous genetic landscape of cuSCC initiation and progression, which can be harnessed to better understand skin oncogenic etiology and prioritize therapeutic candidates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMale lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur in more than half of men above 50 years of age. LUTS were traditionally attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and therefore the clinical terminology often use LUTS and BPH interchangeably. More recently, LUTS were also linked to fibrogenic and inflammatory processes. We tested whether osteopontin (OPN), a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic molecule, is increased in symptomatic BPH. We also tested whether prostate epithelial and stromal cells secrete OPN in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and identified downstream targets of OPN in prostate stromal cells.\n\nMethodsImmunohistochemistry was performed on prostate sections obtained from the transition zone (TZ) of patients who underwent surgery (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) to relieve LUTS i.e. surgical BPH (S-BPH) or patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to remove low-grade prostate cancer (incidental BPH, I-BPH). Images of stained tissue sections were captured with a Nuance Multispectral Imaging system and histoscore, as a measure of OPN staining intensity, was determined with inForm software. OPN protein abundance was determined by Western blot. The ability of prostate cells to secrete osteopontin in response to IL-1{beta} and TGF-{beta}1 was determined in stromal (BHPrS-1) and epithelial (NHPrE-1 and BHPrE-1) cells by ELISA. qPCR was used to measure gene expression changes in these cells in response to OPN.\n\nResultsOPN immunostaining (p=0.0107) and protein levels were more abundant in S-BPH than I-BPH. Staining was distributed across all cell types with highest levels in epithelial cells. Multiple OPN protein variants were identified in immortalized prostate stromal and epithelial cells. TGF-{beta}1 stimulated OPN secretion by NHPrE-1 cells and both IL-1{beta} and TGF-{beta}1 stimulated OPN secretion by BHPrS-1 cells. Interestingly, recombinant OPN increased the mRNA expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, PTGS2 and IL6 in BHPrS-1, but not in epithelial cell lines.\n\nConclusionsOPN is more abundant in prostates of men with S-BPH compared to men with I-BPH. OPN secretion is stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and OPN acts directly on stromal cells to drive the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mRNAs. Pharmacological manipulation of prostatic OPN may have the potential to reduce LUTS by inhibiting both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The design-build-test (DBT) cycle in synthetic biology is considered to be a major bottleneck for progress in the field. The emergence of high-throughput experimental techniques, such as oligo libraries (OLs), combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms, provide the ingredients for a potential \"big-data\" solution that can generate a sufficient predictive capability to overcome the DBT bottleneck. In this work, we apply the OL-ML approach to the design of RNA cassettes used in gene editing and RNA tracking systems. RNA cassettes are typically made of repetitive hairpins, therefore hindering their retention, synthesis, and functionality. Here, we carried out a high-throughput OL-based experiment to generate thousands of new binding sites for the phage coat proteins of bacteriophages MS2 (MCP), PP7 (PCP), and Q{beta} (QCP). We then applied a neural network to vastly expand this space of binding sites to millions of additional predicted sites, which allowed us to identify the structural and sequence features that are critical for the binding of each RBP. To verify our approach, we designed new non-repetitive binding site cassettes and tested their functionality in U2OS mammalian cells. We found that all our cassettes exhibited multiple trackable puncta. Additionally, we designed and verified two additional cassettes, the first containing sites that can bind both PCP and QCP, and the second with sites that can bind either MCP or QCP, allowing for an additional orthogonal channel. Consequently, we provide the scientific community with a novel resource for rapidly creating functional non-repetitive binding site cassettes using one or more of three phage coat proteins with a variety of binding affinities for any application spanning bacteria to mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Recent attempts to assemble long tandem repeats (such as multi-megabase long centromeres) faced the challenge of accurate translation of long error-prone reads from the nucleotide alphabet into the alphabet of repeat units. Centromeres represent a particularly complex type of nested tandem repeats, where each unit is itself a repeat formed by chromosome-specific monomers (a repeat within repeat). Given a set of monomers forming a specific centromere, translation of a read into monomers is modeled as the String Decomposition Problem, finding a concatenate of monomers with the highest-scoring sequence alignment to a given read. We developed a StringDecomposer algorithm for solving this problem, benchmarked it on the set of reads generated by the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, and identified a novel (rare) monomer that extends the set of twelve X-chromosome specific monomers identified more than three decades ago. The accurate translation of each read into a monomer alphabet turns centromere assembly into a more tractable problem than the notoriously difficult problem of assembling centromeres in the nucleotide alphabet. Our identification of a novel monomer emphasizes the importance of careful identification of all (even rare) monomers for follow-up centromere assembly efforts.",

    "abstract": "Blurry visual scenes arise from many causes and image blur is known to be important for scene interpretation, yet there have been very few studies of the visual encoding of blur in biological visual systems or in artificial visual systems trained for object recognition. Recently, a study of single neurons in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys found that a significant fraction of neurons were more responsive to blurred visual stimuli than to sharply defined stimuli. This raises two questions: (1) what types of visual features in natural scenes might underlie blur selectivity in macaque cortex, and (2) can blur selectivity be found in artificial neural networks using the simple artificial stimuli previously applied in vivo? To answer these questions, we presented simple shape stimuli to the widely studied deep convolutional neural network (CNN) known as AlexNet and used deconv-net visualization to identify features that are critical for driving blur selective units. We found that a substantial number of units in the CNN were selective for blur and that several categories of blur selectivity emerged in early-to-middle processing stages. Prominent among these is a set of units selective for spatial boundaries defined by blur contrast. These blur-contrast boundary units may serve the important task of segmentation in natural photographic images and may relate to a large body of literature on second-order boundary detection. Our results lead to the prediction that such units could exist in the visual cortex but have yet to be well characterized and localized, and they provide direction for future neurophysiological tests of blur selectivity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of protein engineering is to accurately model the stability and catalytic activity of enzymes. However, the limitations of functional predictive abilities pose a major challenge for modeling algorithm design, and can be attributed to the lack of large data sets quantifying the functional properties of enzymes. Here, the thermal stability (TM) and Michaelis-Menten constants (kcat, KM, and kcat/KM) of six new variants of the {beta}-glucosidase B (BglB) protein are quantitatively characterized. Molecular stability of the enzyme variants were hypothesized using the Foldit software and BglB was synthesized in E. coli cells. Testing was done through a colorimetric kinetic assay and thermal stability fluorescence-based protein unfolding assay. Results from the assays suggest that all mutations, with the exception of variant Y169M, all experienced reduced catalytic efficiency compared to the wildtype. Assay results indicate that variant W123R is more thermally stable compared to the wildtype, while the differences in thermal stability between the other variants, and the wildtype are negligible. The collected thermal stability and catalytic efficiency data has been added to a data set with the aim of improving Rosetta algorithms for modeling and predicting the functional interactions between biomolecules through a machine learning algorithm and facilitate the precise engineering of protein catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Single neocortical neurons are driven by populations of excitatory inputs, forming the basis of neural selectivity to features of sensory input. Excitatory connections are thought to mature during development through activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity1, whereby similarity between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity selectively strengthens some synapses and weakens others2. Evidence in support of this process ranges from measurements of synaptic ultrastructure to slice and in vivo physiology and imaging studies3,4,5,6,7,8. These corroborating lines of evidence lead to the prediction that a small number of strong synaptic inputs drive neural selectivity, while weak synaptic inputs are less correlated with the functional properties of somatic output and act to modulate activity overall6,7. Supporting evidence from cortical circuits, however, has been limited to measurements of neighboring, connected cell pairs, raising the question of whether this prediction holds for the full profile of synapses converging onto cortical neurons. Here we measure the strengths of functionally characterized excitatory inputs contacting single pyramidal neurons in ferret primary visual cortex (V1) by combining in vivo two-photon synaptic imaging and post hoc electron microscopy (EM). Using EM reconstruction of individual synapses as a metric of strength, we find no evidence that strong synapses play a predominant role in the selectivity of cortical neuron responses to visual stimuli. Instead, selectivity appears to arise from the total number of synapses activated by different stimuli. Moreover, spatial clustering of co-active inputs, thought to amplify synaptic drive, appears reserved for weaker synapses, further enhancing the contribution of the large number of weak synapses to somatic response. Our results challenge the role of Hebbian mechanisms in shaping neuronal selectivity in cortical circuits, and suggest that selectivity reflects the co-activation of large populations of presynaptic neurons with similar properties and a mixture of strengths.",

    "abstract": "Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a worldwide zoonotic disease that may cause severe forms in humans and requires a specific and prolonged antibiotic treatment. Although the current serological and molecular detection tools enable a reliable diagnosis of the disease, culture of C. burnetii strains is mandatory to evaluate their antibiotic susceptibility and sequence their genome in order to optimize patient management and epidemiological studies. However, cultivating this fastidious microorganism is difficult and restricted to reference centers as it requires biosafety-level 3 laboratories and relies on cell culture performed by experienced technicians. In addition, the culture yield is low, which results in a small number of isolates being available. In this work, we developed a novel high content screening (HCS) isolation strategy based on optimized high-throughput cell culture and automated microscopic detection of infected cells with specifically-designed algorithms targeting cytopathic effects. This method was more efficient than the shell-vial assay when applied to both frozen specimens (7 isolates recovered by HCS only, sensitivity 91% vs 78% for shell-vial) and fresh samples (1 additional isolate using HCS, sensitivity 7% vs 5% for shell-vial). In addition, detecting positive cultures by an automated microscope reduced the need for expertise and saved 24% of technician working time. Application of HCS to antibiotic susceptibility testing of 12 strains demonstrated that it was as efficient as the standard procedure that combines shell-vial culture and quantitative PCR. Overall, this high-throughput HCS system paves the way to the development of improved cell culture isolation of human viruses.",

Using single cell transcriptome data of CD8+ T cells in multiple cancers, we identified different cell types, in which Pre_exhaust and exhausted T cells participated in negative regulation of immune system process. By analyzing the co-expression network patterns and differentially expressed genes of Pre_exhaust, exhausted and effector T cells, we identified 35 genes related to T cell exhaustion, which high GSVA scores were associated with significantly poor prognosis in various cancers. In the differentially expressed genes, RGS1 showed the greatest fold change in Pre_exhaust and exhausted cells of three cancers compared with effector T cells, and high expression of RGS1 was also associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. Additionally, RGS1 protein was upregulated significantly in tumor tissues in the immunohistochemistry verification. Furthermore, RGS1 displayed positive correlation with the 35 genes, especially highly correlated with PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2 and TNFRSF9 in CD8+ T cells and cancer tissues, indicating important roles of RGS1 in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Considering the GTP-hydrolysis activity of RGS1 and significantly high mRNA and protein expression in cancer tissues, we speculated that RGS1 potentially mediate the T cell retention to lead to the persistent antigen stimulation, resulting in T cell exhaustion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RGS1 is a new marker and promoting factor for CD8+ T cell exhaustion, and provide theoretical basis for research and immunotherapy of exhausted cells.",

    "abstract": "After food ingestion, pancreatic cells secrete zymogen and hormone-containing granules to precisely control digestion and blood glucose levels. Identifying regulators of this process is paramount to combatting multiple pancreatic diseases. Here we show that pancreatic deletion of the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) leads to hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and hypolipidemia. Surprisingly, insulin and digestive enzymes are produced in the absence of NFIA, however, they are not secreted properly and instead accumulate inside pancreatic cells. In NFIA-deficient mice we saw a reduction of insulin granules in the ready releasable pool and the first-phase insulin response was impaired. We found that NFIA binds to and activates Rab39b, a Rab GTPase critical for exocytosis. Re-expression of Rab39b in NFIA knockout islets restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In sum, the NFIA-Rab39b axis regulates pancreatic physiology through granule recruitment and docking, linking NFIA to a new process with potential effects in diabetes, pancreatitis, and lipid disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMSMethotrexate is an important tool in the arsenal of oncologists, gastroenterologists, and rheumatologists. At low doses it induces intestinal barrier dysfunction that may induce side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and liver injury. Previous studies suggest that lactoferrin can improve barrier function in a variety of contexts. This study set out to determine the mechanism of methotrexate induced barrier dysfunction and assess the effect of lactoferrin and other components of human breast milk on this dysfunction.\n\nMETHODSUsing a murine enteroid model and Caco2 spheroids, we measured flux of basolateral-administered fluorescent dextran into the lumen. Barrier dysfunction was induced using methotrexate (220 nM) or lipopolysaccharide (20 nM). Human lactoferrin was added at 0.8 mg/ml (10 {micro}M). RNAseq was performed on exposed samples.\n\nRESULTSLactoferrin blocks methotrexate-induced barrier dysfunction in murine enteroids. Similar results were observed when barrier dysfunction was induced in Caco2 spheroids with methotrexate and LPS, but not ML7. RNAseq revealed activation of TGF-{beta} response genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by methotrexate, which normalized in the presence of lactoferrin. TGF-{beta} receptor inhibition (RepSox) blocked methotrexate induced barrier dysfunction in Caco2 spheroids. 20 nM TGF-{beta} induced barrier dysfunction in Caco2 spheroids which was also inhibited by lactoferrin.\n\nCONCLUSIONSMethotrexate induces barrier dysfunction by activation of an EMT program promoted by TGF-{beta} signaling and inhibited by lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is also protective of barrier function in an LPS-induced model. The likely mechanism of this effect is blockade of EMT programs induced by TGF-{beta}.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune system signals through various higher order signaling complexes called supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs), which typically organize components of a single pathway. While innate immune signaling pathways have been largely characterized using single receptor stimuli, responses to pathogens require the coordinated engagement of multiple pathways. Here, we report an IRAK1-containing SMOC formed specifically when multiple receptors are activated, which recruits select components of the TLR, MAPK and inflammasome pathways. This allows for signal flux redistribution from TLRs to inflammasomes and facilitates inflammasome licensing through an MKK7-JNK axis, which is defective in Irak1-/- mice. Furthermore, this defect in Irak1-/- mice manifests in increased susceptibility to inflammasome-sensitive pathogens and diminished IL1 production from inflammasomes after co-TLR priming. Thus, IRAK1 SMOCs form a multi-pathway coordinating hub for coincidence detection of microbial signals, which may be employed by innate immune cells as a threat assessment and thresholding mechanism for inflammasome activation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRenin cleavage of angiotensinogen (AGT) has species specificity. Since the residues at positions 11 and 12 of AGT are different between human and mouse AGT, we determined whether these two residues in AGT affect renin cleavage and angiotensin II-mediated functions using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) approach for manipulating AGT in vivo.\n\nApproach and ResultsHepatocyte-specific AGT deficient (hepAGT-/-) mice in an LDL receptor -/- background were infected with AAVs containing a null insert, human AGT, or mouse AGT expressing the same residues of the human protein at positions 11 and 12 [mouse AGT (L11V;Y12I)]. Expression of human AGT in hepAGT-/- mice led to high plasma human AGT concentrations without changes in plasma mouse endogenous AGT, plasma renin concentrations, blood pressure, or atherosclerosis. This is consistent with human AGT not being cleaved by mouse renin. To determine whether the residues at positions 11 and 12 in human AGT lead to the inability of mouse renin to cleave human AGT, hepAGT-/- mice were injected with AAV encoding mouse AGT (L11V;Y12I). Expression of mouse AGT (L11V;Y12I) resulted in increased plasma mouse AGT concentrations, reduced renin concentrations, and increased renal AngII concentrations that were comparable to their concentrations in hepAGT+/+ mice. This mouse AGT variant increased blood pressure and atherosclerosis in hepAGT-/- mice to the magnitude of hepAGT+/+ mice.\n\nConclusionReplacement of L11 and Y12 to V11 and I12, respectively, in mouse AGT does not affect renin cleavage and AngII-mediated functions in mice.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIHuman AGT is not cleaved by mouse renin and does not change AngII-mediated functions in hepatocyte-specific AGT -/- mice.\nC_LIO_LIReplacement of the N-terminal amino acids at 11 and 12 positions from mouse to human AGT does not affect renin cleavage and AngII-mediated functions in hepatocyte-specific AGT -/- mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in single-cell data analysis, the dynamics and topology of the cell cycle in high-dimensional gene expression space remains largely unknown. Here, we use a linear analysis of transcriptome data to reveal that cells move along a circular trajectory in transcriptome space during the cell cycle. This movement occurs largely independently from other cellular processes. Non-cycling gene expression (changes in environment or epigenetic state) adds a third dimension and causes helical motion on a hollow cylinder. The circular trajectory shape indicates minimal acceleration of transcription, i.e. the cell cycle has evolved to minimize changes of transcriptional activity and its entailing regulatory effort. Thus, we uncover a general design principle of the cell cycle that may be of relevance to many other cellular differentiation processes.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCells traverse high-dimensional gene expression space in a 2D circular motion, thus minimizing changes of expression changes (\"Acceleration\").",

    "abstract": "Severe asthma is associated with an increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and an altered composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies have indicated that ECM-ASM cell interactions contribute to this remodeling and its limited reversibility with current therapy. Three-dimensional matrices allow the study of complex cellular responses to different stimuli in an almost natural environment. Our goal was to obtain acellular bronchial matrices and then develop a recellularization protocol with ASM cells. We studied equine bronchi as horses spontaneously develop a human asthma-like disease. The bronchi were decellularized using Triton/Sodium Deoxycholate. The obtained scaffolds retained their anatomical and histological properties. Using immunohistochemistry and a semi-quantitative score to compare native bronchi to scaffolds revealed no significant variation for matrixial proteins. A DNA quantification and electrophoresis indicated that most of DNA was 29.6 ng/mg of tissue {+/-} 5.6 with remaining fragments of less than 100 bp. Primary ASM cells were seeded on the scaffolds. Histological analysis after recellularization showed that ASM cells migrated and proliferated primarily in the decellularized smooth muscle matrix, suggesting a chemotactic effect of the scaffolds. This is the first report of primary ASM cells preferentially repopulating the smooth muscle matrix layer in bronchial matrices. This protocol is now being used to study the molecular interactions occurring between the asthmatic ECMs and ASM to identify effectors of asthmatic bronchial remodeling.",
