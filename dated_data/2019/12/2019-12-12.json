    "abstract": "Temperature is a major factor that impacts tick populations by limiting geographic range of different species. Little is known about the thermal characteristics of these pests outside of a few studies on survival related to thermal tolerance. In this study, thermal tolerance limits, thermal preference, impact of temperature on metabolic rate, and temperature-activity dynamics were examined in larvae for six species of ixodid ticks. Tolerance of low temperatures ranged from -15 to -24{degrees}C with Dermacentor andersoni surviving at the lowest temperatures. High temperature survival ranged from 41 to 47 {degrees}C, with Rhipicephalus sanguineus having the highest upper lethal limit. Ixodes scapularis showed the lowest survival at both low and high temperatures. Thermal preference temperatures were tested from 0-41{degrees}C. D. variabilis exhibited a significant distribution of individuals in the lower temperatures, while the majority of other species gathered around 20-30{degrees}C. Activity was measured from 10-60{degrees}C, and the highest activity was observed in most species was near 30{degrees}C. Metabolic rate was the highest for most species around 40{degrees}C. Both activity and metabolic rate dropped dramatically at temperatures below 10{degrees}C and above 50{degrees}C. In summary, tick species vary greatly in their thermal characteristics, and our results will be critical to predict distribution of these ectoparasites with changing climates.",

In metazoans, G-proteins are activated by GPCR-mediated GDP to GTP exchange on G; however, the role of receptors in regulating plant G-protein signaling remains equivocal. Mounting evidence points to the involvement of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) in regulating plant G-protein signaling pathways, but their mechanistic details remain limited. We have previously shown that during soybean nodulation, the nod factor receptor 1 (NFR1) interacts with G-protein components and indirectly controls signaling.\nC_LIO_LIWe explored the direct regulation of G-protein signaling by RLKs using protein-protein interactions, receptor-mediated phosphorylation and the effects of such phosphorylations on soybean nodule formation.\nC_LIO_LIResults presented in this study demonstrate a direct, phosphorylation-based regulation of G by symbiosis receptor kinase (SymRK). SymRKs interact with and phosphorylate G at multiple residues, including two in its active site, which abolishes GTP binding.

    "abstract": "Former studies on Arabidopsis glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator isoforms GPT1 and GPT2 reported viability of gpt2 mutants, however an essential function for GPT1, manifesting as a variety of gpt1 defects in the heterozygous state during fertilization/seed set. Among other functions, GPT1 is important for pollen and embryo-sac development. Since previous work on enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) revealed comparable effects, we investigated whether GPT1 might dually localize to plastids and peroxisomes. In reporter fusions, GPT2 was found at plastids, but GPT1 also at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and around peroxisomes. GPT1 contacted oxidoreductases and also peroxins that mediate import of peroxisomal membrane proteins from the ER, hinting at dual localization. Reconstitution in yeast proteoliposomes revealed that GPT1 preferentially exchanges glucose-6-phosphate for ribulose-5-phosphate. Complementation analyses of heterozygous gpt1 plants demonstrated that GPT2 is unable to compensate for GPT1 in plastids, whereas genomic GPT1 without transit peptide (enforcing ER/peroxisomal localization) increased gpt1 transmission significantly. Since OPPP activity in peroxisomes is essential during fertilization, and immuno-blot analyses hinted at unprocessed GPT1-specific bands, our findings suggest that GPT1 is indispensable at both plastids and peroxisomes. Together with the G6P-Ru5P exchange preference, dual targeting explains why GPT1 exerts functions distinct from GPT2 in Arabidopsis.\n\nOne sentence summaryIn contrast to plastidial GPT2, GPT1 exhibits slightly different exchange preferences and alternatively targets the ER, from where the protein can be relocated to peroxisomes on demand.",

    "abstract": "Most organisms are more closely related to nearby than distant members of their species, creating spatial autocorrelations in genetic data. This allows us to predict the location of origin of a genetic sample by comparing it to a set of samples of known geographic origin. Here we describe a deep learning method, which we call Locator, to accomplish this task faster and more accurately than existing approaches. In simulations, Locator infers sample location to within 4.1 generations of dispersal and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than a recent model-based approach. We leverage Locators computational efficiency to predict locations separately in windows across the genome, which allows us to both quantify uncertainty and describe the mosaic ancestry and patterns of geographic mixing that characterize many populations. Applied to whole-genome sequence data from Plasmodium parasites, Anopheles mosquitoes, and global human populations, this approach yields median test errors of 16.9km, 5.7km, and 85km, respectively.",

Over the past two decades, the gold standard of landmark data acquisition has been manual detection by a single observer. This approach has proven accurate and reliable in small-scale investigations. However, big data initiatives are increasingly common in biology and morphometrics. This requires fast, automated, and standardized data collection. Image registration, or the spatial alignment of images, is a fundamental technique in automatic image analysis that is well-poised for such purposes. Yet, in the few studies that have explored the utility of registration-based landmarks for geometric morphometrics, relatively high or catastrophic labelling errors around anatomical extrema are common. Such errors can result in misleading representations of the mean shape, an underestimation of biological signal, and altered variance-covariance patterns.\nC_LIO_LIWe combine image registration with a deep and domain-specific neural network to automate and optimize anatomical landmark detection for geometric morphometrics. Using micro-computed tomography images of genetically and morphologically variable mouse skulls, we test our landmarking approach under a variety of registration conditions, including different non-linear deformation frameworks (small vs. large) and atlas strategies (single vs. multi).\nC_LIO_LICompared to landmarks derived from conventional image registration workflows, our optimized landmark data show significant reductions in error at problematic locations (up to 0.63 mm), a 36.4% reduction in average landmark coordinate error, and up to a 45.1% reduction in total landmark distribution error.

In the meantime, rapid development in computer vision greatly accelerates the automation of behavioral analysis. Real-time and event-triggered interference is often necessary for establishing a tight correlation between neuronal activity and behavioral outcome. However, it is time consuming and easily causes variations when performed manually by experimenters. Here, we describe our Track-Control toolbox, a fully automated system with real-time object detection and low latency closed-loop hardware feedback. We demonstrate that the toolbox can be applied in a broad spectrum of behavioral assays commonly used in the neuroscience field, including open field, plus maze, Morris water maze, real-time place preference, social interaction, and sensory-induced defensive behavior tests. The Track-Control toolbox has proved an efficient and easy-to-use method with excellent flexibility for functional extension. Moreover, the toolbox is free, open source, graphic processing unit (GPU)-independent, and compatible across operating system (OS) platforms. Each lab can easily integrate Track-Control into their existing systems to achieve automation.",

    "abstract": "Cell replacement therapy has the potential to cure diseases caused by the absence or malfunction of specialized cells. A substantial impediment to the success of any non-autologous cellular transplant is the need for systemic immunosuppressive drugs to prevent host-mediated rejection of the foreign cells. Cellular encapsulation, i.e., the entrapment of cells within stable polymeric hydrogels, has been clinically explored to prevent host immune recognition and attack, but the efficacy of these encapsulated grafts is poor. While several studies have explored improvements in innate immune acceptance of these encapsulated cells, little attention has been paid to the roles of adaptive immune responses, specifically graft-targeting T cell activation, in graft destabilization. Herein, we established an efficient, single-antigen in vitro platform capable of delineating direct and indirect host T cell recognition to microencapsulated cellular grafts and evaluating their consequential impacts. Using alginate as the model hydrogel, encapsulated membrane-bound ovalbumin (mOVA) stimulator cells were incubated with antigen-specific OTI lymphocytes and subsequent OVA-specific CD8+ T cell activation and effector function were quantified. We established that alginate microencapsulation abrogates direct T cell activation by interrupting donor-host interaction; however, indirect T cell activation mediated by host antigen presenting cells (APCs) primed with shed donor antigens still occurs. These activated T cells imparted cytotoxicity on the encapsulated cells, likely via diffusion of cytotoxic solutes. Overall, this platform delivers unique mechanistic insight into the impacts of hydrogel encapsulation on host adaptive immune responses, as well as a tool for the efficient immune screening on new encapsulation methods and/or synergistic immunomodulatory agents.",

    "abstract": "Environmental association analyses (EAA) seek to identify genetic variants associated with local adaptation by regressing local environmental conditions at collection sites on genome-wide polymorphisms. The rationale is that environmental conditions impose selective pressure on trait(s), and these traits are regulated in part by variation at a genomic level. Here, we present an alternative multivariate genomic approach that can be utilized when both phenotypic and environmental data are available for the population. This framework utilizes Bayesian networks (BN) to elucidate interdependancies between local environmental conditions and empirical phenotypes, and jointly estimates the direct and indirect genetic covariances between empirical phenotypes and environmental conditions using a mixed-effects structural equation model (SEM). Direct genomic covariance between empirical phenotypes and environmental conditions may provide insight into whether QTL that affect adaptation to an environmental gradient also affects the observed phenotype. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we leveraged two existing datasets consisting of 55 climate variables for 1,130 Arabidopsis accessions and empirical phenotypes for fitness and phenology collected on 515 accessions in two common garden locations in Europe. BN showed that plasticity for fitness and phenology was highly dependant on local environmental conditions. Moreover, genomic SEM revealed relatively high positive genomic correlation between plasticity in fitness and environmental variables that describe the favorability of the local environment for plant growth, indicating the presence of common QTL or independent QTL that are tightly linked. We believe the frameworks presented in this manuscript can provide new insights into the genetic basis of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Insects with asynchronous flight muscles are believed to flap at the fundamental frequency of their thorax or thorax-wing system. Flapping in this manner leverages the natural elasticity of the thorax to reduce the energetic requirements of flight. However, to the best of our knowledge, the fundamental frequency of the insect thorax has not been measured via vibration testing. Here, we measure the linear frequency response function (FRF) of several Hymenoptera (Apis mellifera, Polistes dominula, Bombus huntii) thoraxes about their equilibrium states in order to determine their fundamental frequencies. FRFs relate the input force to output acceleration at the insect tergum and are acquired via a mechanical vibration shaker assembly. When compressed 50 m, thorax fundamental frequencies in all specimens approximately 50-150% higher than reported wingbeat frequencies. We suspect that the measured fundamental frequencies are higher in the experiment than during flight due to experimental boundary conditions that stiffen the thorax. Thus, our results corroborate the idea that some insects flap at the fundamental frequency of their thorax. Next, we compress the thorax between 100 - 300 m in 50 m intervals to assess the sensitivity of the fundamental frequency to geometric modifications. For all insects considered, the thorax fundamental frequency increased nearly monotonically with respect to level of compression. This implies that the thorax behaves a nonlinear hardening spring, which we confirmed via static force-displacement testing. Hardening behavior may provide a simple mechanism for the insect to adjust wingbeat frequency, and implies the thorax may behave as a nonlinear Duffing oscillator excited at large amplitude. The Duffing oscillator exhibits amplitude-dependent resonance and may serve as a useful model to increase the flapping frequency bandwidth of small resonant-type flapping wing micro air vehicles.",

    "abstract": "As the effects of anthropogenic climate change grow, mass coral bleaching events are expected to increase in severity and extent. Much research has focused on the environmental stressors themselves, symbiotic community compositions, and transcriptomics of the coral host. Globally, fine-scale population structure of corals is understudied. This study reports patterns of population structure and clonal prevalence found in Montipora capitata and Porites compressa in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Generated using ddRAD methods, genetic data reveals different patterns in each taxa despite them being exposed to the same environmental conditions. STRUCTURE and site-level pairwise FST analyses suggest population structure in M. capitata resembling isolation by distance. Mantel tests show strong, significant FST correlations in M. capitata in relation to geographic distance, water residence time, and salinity and temperature variability (range) at different time scales. STRUCTURE did not reveal strong population structure in P. compressa. FST correlation was found in P. compressa in relation to yearly average sea surface height. We also report high prevalence of clonal colonies in P. compressa in outer bay sites exposed to storms and high energy swells. Amongst only outer bay sites, 7 out of 23 sequenced individuals were clones of other colonies. Amongst all 47 sequenced P. compressa individuals, 8 were clones. Only one clone was detected in M. capitata. Moving forward, it is crucial to consider these preexisting patterns relating to genetic diversity when planning and executing conservation and restoration initiatives. Recognizing that there are differences in population structure and diversity between coral taxa, even on such small-scales, is important as it suggests that small-scale reefs must be managed by species rather than by geography.",

On computed tomographic imaging of the lungs, a range of parenchymal abnormalities were observed in the five patients harboring these predicted deleterious variants in KDR. Four additional PAH cases with rare likely loss-of-function variants in KDR were independently identified in the US PAH Biobank cohort with similar phenotypic characteristics.\n\nConclusionsThe Bayesian inference approach allowed us to independently validate KDR, which encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as a novel PAH candidate gene. Furthermore, this approach specifically associated high impact likely loss-of-function variants in the genetically constrained gene with distinct phenotypes. These findings provide evidence for KDR being a clinically actionable PAH gene and further support the central role of the vascular endothelium in the pathobiology of PAH.",

Isoforms also allow a single gene different functions across various tissues and cells However, methods for efficient genome-wide identification and quantification of RNA isoforms in single cells are still lacking. Here, we introduce single cell Cap And Tail sequencing (scCAT-seq). In conjunction with a novel machine learning algorithm developed for TSS/TES characterization, scCAT-seq can demarcate transcript boundaries of RNA transcripts, providing an unprecedented way to identify and quantify single-cell full-length RNA isoforms based on short-read sequencing. Compared with existing long-read sequencing methods, scCAT-seq has higher efficiency with lower cost. Using scCAT-seq, we identified hundreds of previously uncharacterized full-length transcripts and thousands of alternative transcripts for known genes, quantitatively revealed cell-type specific isoforms with alternative TSSs/TESs in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, mature oocytes and ageing oocytes, and generated the first atlas of the non-human primate cornea. The approach described here can be widely adapted to other short-read or long-read methods to improve accuracy and efficiency in assessing RNA isoform dynamics among single cells.",

Computational approaches allow integration of diverse single-cell datasets, but their efficacy is difficult to validate in the absence of authentic multi-omic measurements. To comprehensively assess the molecular phenotypes of single cells in tissues, we devised single-nucleus methylCytosine, Chromatin accessibility and Transcriptome sequencing (snmC2T-seq) and applied it to post-mortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a computational framework to validate fine-grained cell types using multi-modal information and assessed the effectiveness of computational integration methods.

Comparing these results to human twins, we find the transcriptional signatures which define individuals exhibit conserved co-expression, suggesting a substantial fraction of phenotypic and disease discordance within mammals arises from developmental stochasticity.\n\nOne sentence summaryLongitudinal gene expression in identical armadillo quadruplets reveals a major role for developmental stochasticity.",

A maternal vaccine capable of boosting neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against circulating viruses in HIV-infected pregnant women could effectively decrease mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, it is not known if an HIV envelope (Env) vaccine administered to infected pregnant women can enhance autologous virus neutralization.\n\nHere, we assessed autologous virus nAb responses in maternal plasma samples obtained from AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG) Protocols 104 and 102, historical Phase I safety and immunogenicity trials of recombinant HIV Env subunit vaccines in HIV-infected pregnant women (NCT00001041). AVEG 104 participants were randomized to receive 300 {micro}g Env subunit MN recombinant gp120 with alum adjuvant or alum alone.

Single genome amplification (SGA) was used to obtain HIV env gene sequences from autologous viruses for pseudovirus production in pre- and post-vaccination plasma of HIV-infected pregnant vaccinees (n=6 gp120, n=1 gp160) and placebo recipients (n=3).\n\nWe detected an increase in MN gp120-specific IgG binding in the vaccinee group between the first immunization visit and the last visit at delivery (p=0.027, 2-sided Wilcoxon test). However, no difference was observed in the neutralization potency of maternal plasma collected at delivery against autologous viruses isolated from early or late pregnancy. Thus, maternal vaccination with gp120/160 did not boost maternal autologous virus nAb responses.

    "abstract": "Despite its isolation and extreme climate, Antarctica is home to diverse fauna and associated microorganisms. It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. However, there is a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To test the idea that penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA-Sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82) and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data therefore reject the theory that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "Plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic-resistance and virulence in pathogenic bacteria underlies a major public health issue. Understanding how, in the absence of antibiotic-mediated selection, plasmid-bearing cells avoid being outnumbered by plasmid-free cells, is key to developing counter strategies. Here we quantified the induction of Enterococcus faecalis plasmidial sex-pheromone pathway to show that the integration of the stimulatory (mate-sensing) and inhibitory (self-sensing) signaling modules from the pCF10 conjugative plasmid, provides a precise measure of the recipient-to-donor ratio, agnostic to variations in population size. Such ratiometric control of conjugation favors vertical plasmid-transfer under low mating likelihood and allows activation of conjugation functions only under high mating likelihood. We further show that this strategy constitutes a cost-effective investment into mating effort, as overstimulation produces unproductive self-aggregation and reductions in the growth rate. A mathematical model suggests that ratiometric control of conjugation limits the spread of antibiotic resistance in absence of antibiotics, predicting a long-term stable co-existence of donors and recipients. Our results demonstrate how population-level parameters can control transfer of antibiotic-resistance in bacteria, opening the door for biotic control strategies. Ratiometric sensing in bacteria mirrors sexual behaviors observed in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "An in-frame deletion of a single glutamic acid codon in the TOR1A gene causes the neurological disorder DYT1 dystonia, but the cellular pathophysiology of this disorder remains elusive. A current model postulates that the wild-type (WT) torsinA protein is mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but that the mutant form ({Delta}E-torsinA) is diverted to the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. This mis-localization has been observed by overexpressing the proteins in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. However, it is not clear whether this model is valid for the astrocytic glial cells that support and modify neuronal functions. Here we report, using rodent astrocytes in primary culture, that the overexpressed torsinA proteins were distributed as predicted by the mis-localization model. We also found by immunocytochemistry that the cultured astrocytes express torsinA endogenously. Most of the signals from endogenous protein, whether the WT or {Delta}E form, were localized near a cis-Golgi marker GM130. Such localization of endogenous proteins was found in glial cells from several sources: the hippocampus of WT rats, the hippocampus and striatum of WT mice, and the hippocampus and striatum of {Delta}E-torsinA knock-in mice, a model of DYT1 dystonia. These results show that the mis-localization model is applicable to overexpressed torsinA proteins, but not applicable to those expressed at endogenous levels, at least in cultured rodent astrocytes. These discrepancies in the distribution of overexpressed versus endogenous torsinA proteins highlight the potential need for caution in interpreting the results of overexpression studies.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral artery segmentation plays an important role in the direct visualization of the human brain to obtain vascular system information. At ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging, hyperintensity of the cerebral arteries in T1 weighted (T1w) images could be segmented from brain tissues such as gray and white matter. In this study, we propose an automated method to segment the cerebral arteries using multi-contrast images including T1w images of a magnetization-prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence at 7 T. The proposed method employed a seed-based region-growing strategy with the following procedures. (1) Two seed regions were defined by Frangi filtering applied to T1w images and by a simple calculation from multi-contrast images, (2) the two seed regions were combined, (3) the combined seed regions were expanded using a region growing algorithm to acquire the cerebral arteries. Time-of-flight (TOF) images were obtained as a reference to evaluate the proposed method. We successfully performed vessel segmentations from T1w MP2RAGE images, which mostly overlapped with the segmentations from the TOF images. As large arteries can affect the normalization of anatomical images to the standard coordinate space in functional and structural studies, we also investigated the effect of the cerebral arteries on spatial transformation using vessel segmentation by the proposed method. As a result, the T1w image removing the cerebral arteries showed better agreement with the standard atlas compared with the T1w image containing the arteries. Thus, because the proposed method using MP2RAGE images can obtain brain tissue anatomical information as well as cerebral artery information without need for additional acquisitions such as of the TOF sequence, it is useful and time saving for medical diagnosis and functional and structural studies.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThere are reports that a b-isoform of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A-165 (VEGFA165b) is predominant in normal human vitreous, switching to the a-isoform (VEGFA165a) in the vitreous of some diseased eyes. While these isoforms appear to have a different ability to activate the VEGF-Receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in various endothelial cells, the nature of their ability to activate intracellular signalling pathways is not fully characterized, especially in retinal endothelial cells. We determined their activation potential for two key intracellular signalling pathways (MAPK, AKT) over complete dose-response curves and compared potential effects on the expression of several VEGFA165 target genes in primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs).\n\nMethodsTo determine full dose-response curves for the activation of MAPK (ERK1/2), AKT and VEGFR2, direct in-cell western assays were developed using primary Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HRMECs). Potential differences in dose-response effects on gene expression markers related to endothelial cell / leukocyte adhesion (ICAM1, VCAM1 and SELE) and tight-junctions (CLDN5 and OCLN) were tested by quantitative-PCR.\n\nResultsActivation dose-response analysis revealed much stronger activation of MAPK, AKT and VEGFR2 by the a-isoform at lower doses. MAPK activation in primary HRMECs displayed a sigmoidal dose-response to a range of VEGFA165a concentrations spanning 10-250 pM, which shifted higher into the 100-5,000 pM range with VEGFA165b. Similar maximum activation of MAPK was achieved by both isoforms at high concentration. Maximum activation of AKT by VEGFA165b was only half of the maximum activation from VEGFA165a. At a lower intermediate dose, where VEGFA165a activated intracellular signalling stronger than VEGFA165b, the changes to VEGFA target gene expression was generally greater with VEGFA165a.\n\nConclusionsIn primary HRMECs, VEGFA165a could maximally activate MAPK and AKT at lower concentrations where VEGFA165b had relatively little effect. The timing for maximal activation of MAPK was similar for both isoforms, which is different than reprorted for non-retinal endothelial cells. While VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b are limited to the sequence of their six C-terminal six amino acids, this results in a large difference in their ablility to activate at least two key intracellular signalling pathways and potentially VEGF target gene expression in primary human retinal endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Smart materials are able to alter one or more of their properties in response to defined stimuli. Our ability to design and create such materials, however, does not match the diversity and specificity of responses seen within the biological domain. We propose that relocation of molecular phenomena from living cells into hydrogels can be used to confer smart functionality to materials. We establish that cell-free protein synthesis can be conducted in agarose hydrogels, that gene expression occurs throughout the material and that co-expression of genes is possible. We demonstrate that gene expression can be controlled transcriptionally (using in gel gene interactions) and translationally in response to small molecule and nucleic acid triggers. We use this system to design and build a genetic device that can alter the structural property of its chassis material in response to exogenous stimuli. Importantly, we establish that a wide range of hydrogels are appropriate chassis for cell-free synthetic biology, meaning a designer may alter both the genetic and hydrogel components according to the requirements of a given application. We probe the relationship between the physical structure of the gel and in gel protein synthesis and reveal that the material itself may act as a macromolecular crowder enhancing protein synthesis. Given the extensive range of genetically encoded information processing networks in the living kingdom and the structural and chemical diversity of hydrogels, this work establishes a model by which cell-free synthetic biology can be used to create autonomic and adaptive materials.\n\nSignificance statementSmart materials have the ability to change one or more of their properties (e.g. structure, shape or function) in response to specific triggers. They have applications ranging from light-sensitive sunglasses and drug delivery systems to shape-memory alloys and self-healing coatings. The ability to programme such materials, however, is basic compared to the ability of a living organism to observe, understand and respond to its environment. Here we demonstrate the relocation of biological information processing systems from cells to materials. We achieved this by operating small, programmable genetic devices outside the confines of a living cell and inside hydrogel matrices. These results establish a method for developing materials functionally enhanced with molecular machinery from biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a slow-growing, human pathogen that causes atypical pneumonia. Because it lacks a cell wall, many antibiotics are ineffective, and vaccination is required. Due to its reduced genome and dearth of many biosynthetic pathways, this fastidious bacterium depends on rich, undefined medium for growth, which makes large-scale cultivation for vaccine production challenging and expensive.\n\nTo understand factors limiting growth, we developed a genome-scale, constraint-based model of M. pneumoniae called iEG158_mpn to describe the metabolic potential of this bacterium. We have put special emphasis on cell membrane formation to identify key lipid components to maximize bacterial growth. We have used this knowledge to predict and validate in vitro two serum-free media able to sustain growth.\n\nOur findings also show that glycolysis and lipid metabolism are much less efficient under hypoxia; these findings suggest that factors other than metabolism and membrane formation alone affect the growth of M. pneumoniae.\n\nAltogether, our modelling approach enabled us to optimize medium composition, capacitated growth in defined media and streamlined operational requirements, thereby providing the basis for stable, reproducible and less expensive vaccine production.",

    "abstract": "The adaptation to visuomotor rotations is one of the most studied paradigms of motor learning. Previous literature has presented evidence of a dependency between the process of adaptation to visuomotor rotations and the constrains dictated by the workspace of the biological actuators, the muscles, and their co-activation strategies, modeled using muscle synergies analysis. To better understand this relationship, we asked a sample of healthy individuals (N =7) to perform two experiments aiming at characterizing the adaptation to visuomotor rotations in terms of rotations of the activation space of the muscle synergies during isometric reaching tasks. In both experiments, subjects were asked to adapt to visual rotations altering the position mapping between the force exerted on a fixed manipulandum and the movement of a cursor on a screen. In the first experiment subjects adapted to three different visuomotor rotation angles (30{degrees}, 40{degrees} and 50{degrees} clockwise) applied to the whole experimental workspace. In the second experiment subjects adapted to a single visuomotor rotation angle (45{degrees} clockwise) applied to eight different sub-spaces of the whole workspace, while also performing movements in the rest of the unperturbed workspace. The results from the first experiment confirmed the observation that visuomotor rotations induce rotations in the synergies activation workspace that are proportional to the visuomotor rotation angle. The results from the second experiment showed that rotations affecting limited sub-spaces of the whole workspace are adapted for by rotating only the synergies involved in the movement, with an angle proportional to the distance between the preferred angle of the synergy and the sub-space covered by the rotation. Moreover, we show that the activation of a synergy is only rotated when the sub-space covered by the visual perturbation is applied at the boundaries of workspace of the synergy. We found these results to be consistent across subjects, synergies and sub-spaces. Moreover, we found a correlation between synergies and muscle rotations further confirming that the adaptation process can be well described, at the neuromuscular level, using the muscle synergies model. These results provide information on how visuomotor rotations can be used to induce a desired neuromuscular response.",

    "abstract": "Peritoneal metastases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in ovarian cancer. Despite current surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapies, the majority of patients diagnosed with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer develop recurrent disease and overall survival rates remain poor. It is known that ovarian cancer is a radiosensitive tumor. Historically, total abdominal irradiation (TAI) was used as an effective postsurgical adjuvant therapy in the management of chemotherapy sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer. However, TAI fell out of favor due to high toxicity, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract. We have developed a preclinical irradiation platform that allows for total abdominal ultrahigh dose rate FLASH irradiation. We demonstrate that TAI-FLASH reduces radiation-induced intestinal injury in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice compared to conventional dose rate (CONV) irradiation. Single high dose TAI-FLASH reduced mortality from gastrointestinal syndrome, spared gut function and epithelial integrity, and decreased cell death in crypt base columnar cells. Importantly, FLASH and CONV irradiation had similar efficacy in the reduction of ovarian cancer peritoneal metastases. These findings suggest that FLASH irradiation may be an effective strategy to enhance the therapeutic index of radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer in women.",

    "abstract": "Condensins are best known for their role in shaping chromosomes. However, other functions as organizing interphase chromatin and transcriptional control have been reported in yeasts and animals. Yeasts encode one condensin complex, while higher eukaryotes have two of them (condensin I and II). Both, condensin I and II, are conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana, but so far little is known about their function. Here we show that the A. thaliana CAP-D2 (condensin I) and CAP-D3 (condensin II) subunits are highly expressed in mitotically active tissues. In silico and pull-down experiments indicate that both CAP-D proteins interact with the other condensin I and II subunits. Our data suggest that the expression, localization and composition of the condensin complexes in A. thaliana are similar as in other higher eukaryotes. Previous experiments showed that the lack of A. thaliana CAP-D3 leads to centromere association during interphase. To study the function of CAP-D3 in chromatin organization more in detail we compared the nuclear distribution of rDNA, of centromeric chromocenters and of different epigenetic marks, as well as the nuclear size between wild-type and cap-d3 mutants. In these mutants an association of heterochromatic sequences occurs, but nuclear size and the general methylation and acetylation patterns remain unchanged. In addition, transcriptome analyses revealed a moderate influence of CAP-D3 on general transcription, but a stronger one on transcription of stress-related genes. We propose a model for the CAP-D3 function during interphase, where CAP-D3 localizes in euchromatin loops to stiff them, and consequently separates centromeric regions and 45S rDNA repeats.",

    "abstract": "Many animals decorate their exterior with environmental materials and these decorations are predicted to increase their survival. The adaptive significance of these decorations, however, has seldomly been tested experimentally under field conditions. Here, I studied the anti-predatory functions of the decoration (bag) of a bagworm moth, Eumeta crameri against their natural predator, Oecophylla smaragdina, the Asian weaver ant. I experimentally tested if bag removal from caterpillars resulted in more predation than bagged caterpillar under field conditions, which would support the hypothesis that bags are selected to protect the caterpillars against their predators. In support of that, I showed that caterpillars without a bag were attacked, killed and taken to ants nest significantly more than bagged caterpillars. My study provides rare experimental evidence for anti-predatory functions of the decoration. My study suggests that decorating behaviour has evolved in animals as an anti-predatory defence mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The cell wall polymers wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) are often modified with glycosyl and D-alanine residues. Recent studies have shown that a three-component glycosylation system is used for the modification of LTA in several Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes. In the L. monocytogenes 1/2a strain 10403S, the cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase GtlA is thought to use UDP-galactose to produce the C55-P-galactose lipid intermediate, which is transported across the membrane by an unknown flippase. Next, the galactose residue is transferred onto the LTA backbone on the outside of the cell by the glycosyltransferase GtlB. Here we show that GtcA is necessary for the glycosylation of LTA in L. monocytogenes 10403S and B. subtilis 168 and we hypothesize that these proteins act as C55-P-sugar flippases. With this we revealed that GtcA is involved in the glycosylation of both teichoic acid polymers in L. monocytogenes 10403S, namely WTA with N-acetylglucosamine and LTA with galactose residues. These findings indicate that the L. monocytogenes GtcA protein can act on different C55-P-sugar intermediates. Further characterization of GtcA in L. monocytogenes led to the identification of residues essential for its overall function as well as residues, which predominately impact WTA or LTA glycosylation.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the fucose-specific lectin LecB, which has been identified as virulence factor. LecB has a tetrameric structure with four opposing binding sites and has been shown to act as crosslinker. Here, we demonstrate that LecB strongly binds to the glycosylated moieties of {beta}1-integrins on the basolateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells and caused rapid integrin endocytosis. Whereas internalized integrins were degraded via a lysosomal pathway, washout of LecB restored integrin cell surface localization, thus indicating a specific and direct action of LecB on integrins to bring about their endocytosis. Interestingly, LecB was able to trigger uptake of active and inactive {beta}1-integrins and also of complete 3{beta}1-integrin - laminin complexes. We provide a mechanistic explanation for this unique endocytic process by showing that LecB has the additional ability to recognize fucose-bearing glycosphingolipids and caused the formation of membrane invaginations on giant unilamellar vesicles. In cells, LecB recruited integrins to these invaginations by crosslinking integrins and glycosphingolipids. In epithelial wound healing assays, LecB specifically cleared integrins from the surface of cells located at the wound edge and blocked cell migration and wound healing in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the wild type P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was able to loosen cell-substrate adhesion in order to crawl underneath exposed cells, whereas knockout of LecB significantly reduced crawling events. Based on these results we suggest that LecB has a role in disseminating bacteria along the cell - basement membrane interface.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the leading causes for nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa is able to switch between planktonic, intracellular, and biofilm-based lifestyles, which allows it to evade the immune system as well as antibiotic treatment. Hence, alternatives to antibiotic treatment are urgently required to combat P. aeruginosa infections. Lectins, like the fucose-specific LecB, are promising targets, because removal of LecB resulted in decreased virulence in mouse models. Currently, several research groups are developing LecB inhibitors. However, the role of LecB in host-pathogen interaction is not well understood. The significance of our research is in identifying cellular mechanisms how LecB facilitates P. aeruginosa infection: We introduce LecB as new member to the list of bacterial molecules that bind integrins and show that P. aeruginosa can efficiently move forward underneath attached epithelial cells by loosening cell - basement membrane attachment in a LecB-dependent manner.",

Furthermore, pH also changes and affects readout of fluorescence-based biosensors for single-cell measurements. To measure ATP changes reliably in single yeast cells, we developed yAT1.03, an adapted version of the AT1.03 ATP biosensor, that is pH-insensitive. We show that pregrowth conditions largely affect ATP dynamics during transitions. Moreover, single-cell analyses showed a large variety in ATP responses, which implies large differences of glycolytic startup between individual cells. We found three clusters of dynamic responses, and show that a small subpopulation of wild type cells reached an imbalanced state during glycolytic startup, characterised by low ATP levels.

    "abstract": "The inactivation of the ciliary proteins polycystin 1 or 2 leads to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the leading genetic cause of chronic kidney disease. Both cilia signaling and interstitial inflammation play a critical role in the disease. Yet, the reciprocal interactions between immune and tubular cells are not well characterized. The transcription factor STAT3, which is suspected to fuel ADPKD progression, is involved in crosstalks between immune and non-immune cells in various tissues and is a component of the cilia proteome. Here, we explore how STAT3 intersects with cilia signaling, renal inflammation and cyst growth using conditional murine models of post-developmental Pkd1, Stat3 and cilia ablation. Our results indicate that, although primary cilia directly modulate STAT3 activation in vitro, the bulk of STAT3 activation in polycystic kidneys occurs through an indirect mechanism in which primary cilia trigger macrophage recruitment to the kidney, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation. Surprisingly, while disrupting Stat3 in Pkd1 deficient tubules slightly reduced cyst burden, it resulted in a massive infiltration of the cystic kidneys by macrophages and T cells, precluding any improvement of kidney function. Mechanistically, STAT3 represses the expression of the inflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 in polycystic kidneys and cultured tubular cells. These results demonstrate that STAT3 is not a critical driver of cyst growth in ADPKD but plays a major role in the crosstalk between immune and tubular cells that shapes disease expression.",

    "abstract": "The mite Varroa destructor is one of the most destructive parasites of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the primary cause of colony collapse in most regions of the world. These mites cause serious injury to their hosts, especially during the larval and pupal stages, and serve as the vector for several viruses, which affect honey bee health causing colony death. Attempts by beekeepers to control these mites have yielded limited success. The inability to rear populations of mites in vitro that excludes contact with their honey bee hosts has stymied research of Varroa biology. Previous attempts to rear and/or maintain Varroa mites in vitro by feeding them on artificial diets have had limited success. Several methods were plagued by mechanical failures including leaking membranes and, thus far, none have been widely adopted. Here we report a robust system for maintaining Varroa mites that includes an artificial diet, which does not contain honey bee tissue-derived components, thus making it particularly valuable in studying mite vectoring of honey bee viruses. With our system we demonstrated for the first time that Varroa mites maintained on an artificial diet supplemented with the particles of honey bee viruses, cDNA clone-derived genetically tagged Varroa destructor virus-1 and wild-type Deformed wing virus, can acquire and later transmit these viruses to recipient honey bee pupae. Along with providing an opportunity to study parasites and pathogens in the absence of honey bee hosts, this in vitro system for Varroa mite maintenance is both scalable and consistent. These features can be used to better understand mite nutritional needs, metabolic activity, responses to chemicals and other biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization has the potential to generate or homogenize biodiversity and is a particularly common phenomenon in plants, with an estimated 25% of species undergoing inter-specific gene flow. However, hybridization in Amazonias megadiverse tree flora was assumed to be extremely rare despite extensive sympatry between closely related species, and its role in diversification remains enigmatic because it has not yet been examined empirically. Using members of a dominant Amazonian tree family (Brownea, Fabaceae) as a model to address this knowledge gap, our study recovered extensive evidence of hybridization among multiple lineages across phylogenetic scales. More specifically, our results uncovered several historical introgression events between Brownea lineages and indicated that gene tree incongruence in Brownea is best explained by introgression, rather than solely by incomplete lineage sorting. Furthermore, investigation of recent hybridization using [~]19,000 ddRAD loci recovered a high degree of shared variation between two Brownea species which co-occur in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Our analyses also showed that these sympatric lineages exhibit homogeneous rates of introgression among loci relative to the genome-wide average, implying a lack of selection against hybrid genotypes and a persistence of hybridization over time. Our results demonstrate that gene flow between multiple Amazonian tree species has occurred across temporal scales, and contrasts with the prevailing view of hybridizations rarity in Amazonia. Overall, our results provide novel evidence that reticulate evolution influenced diversification in part of the Amazonian tree flora, which is the most diverse on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Interferons (IFNs), produced during viral infections, induce the expression of hundreds of IFN- stimulated genes (ISGs). Some ISGs have specific antiviral activity while others regulate the cellular response. Besides functioning as an antiviral effector, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a negative regulator of IFN signalling and inherited ISG15-deficiency leads to autoinflammatory interferonopathies where individuals exhibit elevated ISG expression in the absence of pathogenic infection. We have recapitulated these effects in cultured human A549-ISG15-/- cells and (using A549-UBA7-/- cells) confirmed that posttranslational modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) is not required for regulation of the type-I IFN response. ISG15-deficient cells pre-treated with IFN- were resistant to paramyxovirus infection. We also showed that IFN- treatment of ISG15-deficient cells led to significant inhibition of global protein synthesis leading us to ask whether resistance was due to the direct antiviral activity of ISGs or whether cells were non-permissive due to translation defects. We took advantage of the knowledge that IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) is the principal antiviral ISG for parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Knockdown of IFIT1 restored PIV5 infection in IFN--pre-treated ISG15-deficient cells, confirming that resistance was due to the direct antiviral activity of the IFN response. However, resistance could be induced if cells were pre-treated with IFN- for longer times, presumably due to inhibition of protein synthesis. These data show that the cause of virus resistance is two-fold; ISG15-deficiency leads to the  early over-expression of specific antiviral ISGs, but the later response is dominated by an unanticipated, ISG15- dependent, loss of translational control.\n\nKey pointsCell culture model of ISG15-deficiency replicate findings in ISG15-/- patient cells\n\nCause of resistance in ISG15-/- cells differs depending on duration of IFN treatment\n\nISG15-/- patients without serious viral disease dont prove ISGylation is unimportant",

Experimental images are extremely noisy, however, and during iterative refinement it is possible to stably incorporate noise into the reconstructed density.

Several strategies are routinely used to prevent the spurious incorporation of noise within reconstructed volumes, the most common being independent refinement of two sides of a split dataset.\n\nIn this study, we show that over-fitting remains an issue within regions of low local signal-to-noise in reconstructed volumes refined using the half-set strategy.

    "abstract": "SummaryA number of methods have been devised to address the need for targeted genomic resequencing. One of these methods, Region-specific extraction (RSE) of DNA is characterized by the capture of long DNA fragments (15-20 kb) by magnetic beads, after enzymatic extension of oligonucleotides hybridized to selected genomic regions. Facilitating the selection of the most optimal capture oligos targeting a region of interest, satisfying the properties of temperature (Tm) and entropy ({Delta}G), while minimizing the formation of primer dimers in a pooled experiment is therefore necessary. Manual design and selection of oligos becomes an extremely arduous task complicated by factors such as length of the target region and number of targeted regions. Here we describe, AnthOligo, a web-based application developed to optimally automate the process of generation of oligo sequences to be used for the targeting and capturing the continuum of large and complex genomic regions. Apart from generating oligos for RSE, this program may have wider applications in the design of customizable internal oligos to be used as baits for gene panel analysis or even probes for large-scale comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array processes.\n\nImplementation and AvailabilityThe application written in Java8 and run on Tomcat9 is a lightweight Java Spring MVC framework that provides the user with a simple interface to upload an input file in BED format and customize parameters for each task. A Redis-like MapReduce framework is implemented to run sub-tasks in parallel to optimize time and system resources alongside a  task-queuing system that runs submitted jobs as a server-side background daemon. The task of probe design in AnthOligo commences when a user uploads an input file and concludes with the generation of a result-set containing an optimal set of region-specific oligos.\n\nAnthOligo is currently available as a public web application with URL: http://antholigo.chop.edu.",

    "abstract": "Cleft lip is one of the most highly prevalent birth defects in human patients. However, there remain a limited number of mouse models of cleft lip and thus much work is needed to further characterize genes and mechanisms that lead to this disorder. It is well established that crosstalk between epithelial and mesenchymal cells underlies formation of the face and palate, yet the basic molecular events mediating this crosstalk are still poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that mice with ablation of the epithelial-specific splicing factor Esrp1 have fully penetrant bilateral CL/P. In this study we further investigated the mechanisms by which ablation of Esrp1 leads to cleft lip as well as cleft palate. These studies included a detailed analysis of the changes in splicing and total gene expression in embryonic ectoderm during formation of the face as well as gene expression changes in adjacent mesenchyme. We identified altered expression in components of pathways previously implicated in cleft lip and/or palate, including numerous components of the Wnt signaling pathway. These findings illustrate that maintenance of an Esrp1 regulated epithelial splicing program is essential for face development through regulation of key signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET), the process whereby cells access electron acceptors or donors that reside many cell lengths away, enables metabolic activity by microorganisms, particularly under oxidant-limited conditions that occur in multicellular bacterial biofilms. Although different mechanisms underpin this process in select organisms, a widespread strategy involves extracellular electron shuttles, redox-active metabolites that are secreted and recycled by diverse bacteria. How these shuttles catalyze electron transfer within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazine electron shuttles mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, which are important in nature and disease. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by binding to eDNA. In vitro, different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and phenazines can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA; the biofilm eDNA can also support rapid electron transfer between redox active intercalators. Electrochemical measurements of biofilms indicate that retained PYO supports an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET and slow loss from the biofilm. Together, these results establish that eDNA facilitates phenazine metabolic processes in P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting a model for how extracellular electron shuttles achieve retention and efficient EET in biofilms.",

To identify other factors that act in the budding-yeast pathway, we performed an unbiased genetic selection. This selection identified Xrn1p, the cytoplasmic 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease, as a cofactor of RNAi in budding yeast. Deletion of XRN1 impaired gene silencing in N. castellii, and this impaired silencing was attributable to multiple functions of Xrn1p, including affecting the composition of siRNA species in the cell, influencing the efficiency of siRNA loading into Argonaute, degradation of cleaved passenger strand, and degradation of sliced target RNA.",

Genomic epidemiological analysis revealed that the eight outbreak isolates were clustered together with ATCC 36246, a Chinese strain caused outbreaks with high mortality, also closely related to three isolates from human cases from Virginia, but significantly different from an outbreak-unrelated swine isolate from Arizona and most isolates from other animal species. Comparative genomic analysis on two outbreak isolates and another outbreak-unrelated isolate identified several genomic islands and virulence genes specifically in the outbreak isolates only, which are likely associated with the high mortality observed in the swine population.

While the underlying neural dynamics have been linked to activity within cortico-striatal networks, recent work has shown that the behavioral benefits of temporal prediction causally rely on the cerebellum. Here we examine the involvement of the human cerebellum in the generation and/or temporal adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics, measuring scalp electroencephalography in individuals with cerebellar degeneration. When the temporal prediction relied on an interval representation, duration-dependent adjustments were impaired in the cerebellar group compared to matched controls. This impairment was evident in ramping activity, beta-band power, and phase locking of delta-band activity. Remarkably, these same neural adjustments were preserved when the prediction relied on a rhythmic stream. Thus, the cerebellum has a context-specific causal role in the adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics of temporal prediction, providing the requisite modulation to optimize behavior.",

    "abstract": "Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling is a critical driver of hormone-dependent prostate cancer and has also been proposed to have biological activity in female hormone-dependent cancers, including type I endometrial carcinoma (EMC). In this study, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of a third-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, in a genetic mouse model of EMC, Sprr2f-Cre;Ptenfl/fl. In this model, ablation of Pten in the uterine epithelium leads to localized and distant malignant disease as observed in human EMC. We hypothesized that administering enzalutamide through the diet would temporarily decrease the incidence of invasive and metastatic carcinoma, while prolonged administration would result in development of resistance and loss of efficacy. Short-term treatment with enzalutamide reduced overall tumor burden through increased apoptosis but failed to prevent progression of invasive and metastatic disease. These results suggest that AR signaling may have biphasic, oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in EMC that are dependent on disease stage. Enzalutamide treatment increased Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression within both stromal and tumor cell compartments. Prolonged administration of enzalutamide decreased apoptosis, increased tumor burden and resulted in the clonal expansion of tumor cells expressing high levels of p53 protein, suggestive of acquired Trp53 mutations. In conclusion, we show that enzalutamide induces apoptosis in EMC but has limited efficacy overall as a single agent. Induction of PR, a negative regulator of endometrial proliferation, suggests that adding progestin therapy to enzalutamide administration may further decrease tumor burden and result in a prolonged response.",

We identified the primary signals for the major ISC regulatory pathways and their respective cellular sources.

    "abstract": "The primary claim of the Richiardi et. al. 2015 Science article1 is that a measure of correlated gene expression, significant strength fraction (SSF), is related to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks. However, there is still debate about this claim and whether spatial proximity, in the form of contiguous clusters, accounts entirely, or only partially, for SSF2,3. Here, thirteen distributed networks were simulated by combining 34 contiguous clusters randomly placed throughout cortex, with resulting edge distance distributions similar to rsfMRI networks. Cluster size was modulated (6-15mm radius) to test its influence on SSF false positive rate (SSF-FPR) among the simulated  noise networks. The contribution of rsfMRI networks on SSF-FPR was examined by comparing simulations using: 1) all cortical samples 2) all samples with non-rsfMRI cluster centers and 3) only non-rsfMRI samples. Results show that SSF-FPR is influenced only by cluster size (r>0.9, p<0.001), not by rsfMRI samples. Simulations using 14mm radius clusters most resembled rsfMRI networks. When thresholding at p<10-4, the SSF-FPR was 0.47. Genes that maximize SF have high global spatial autocorrelation. In conclusion, SSF is unrelated to rsfMRI networks. The main conclusion of Richiardi et. al. 2015 is based on a finding that is [~]50% likely to be a false positive, not less than 0.01% as originally reported in the article1. We discuss why distance corrections alone and external face validity are insufficient to establish a trustworthy relationship between correlated gene expression measures and rsfMRI networks, and propose more rigorous approaches to preclude common pitfalls in related studies.",

    "abstract": "Rigosertib is a novel benzyl styryl sulfone that inhibits the growth of a wide variety of human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. We recently provided structural and biochemical evidence to show that rigosertib acts as a RAS-mimetic by binding to Ras Binding Domains (RBDs) of the RAF and PI3K family proteins and disrupts their binding to RAS. In a recent study, Jost et al (2017) attributed the mechanism of action of rigosertib to microtubule-binding. In these studies, rigosertib was obtained from a commercial vendor. We have been unable to replicate the reported results with clinical grade rigosertib, and hence compared the purity of clinical grade and commercially sourced rigosertib. We find that the commercially sourced rigosertib contains approximately 5% ON01500, a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. Clinical grade rigosertib, which is free of this impurity, does not exhibit tubulin binding activity. In vivo, cell lines that express mutant {beta}-tubulin (TUBBL240F) were also reported to be resistant to the effects of rigosertib. However, our studies showed that both wild-type and TUBBL240F-expressing cells failed to proliferate in the presence of rigosertib at concentrations that are lethal to wild-type cells. Morphologically, we find that rigosertib, at lethal concentrations, induced a senescence-like phenotype in the small percentage of both wild-type and TUBBL240F-expressing cells that survive in the presence of rigosertib. Our results suggest that TUBBL240F expressing cells are more prone to undergo senescence in the presence of rigosertib as well as BI2536, an unrelated ATP-competitive pan-PLK inhibitor. The appearance of these senescent cells could be incorrectly scored as resistant cells in flow cytometric assays using short term cultures.",

    "abstract": "Following acute injury, leukocytes rapidly infiltrate into tissues. For efficient recruitment, leukocytes must sense and respond to signals from both from the damaged tissue and from one another. However, the cell type specific transcriptional changes that influence leukocyte recruitment and wound healing have not been well characterized. In this study, we performed a large-scale translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA sequencing screen in larval zebrafish to identify genes differentially expressed by neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells in the context of wounding. We identified the complement pathway and c3a.1, homologous to the C3A component of human complement, as significantly increased in neutrophils in response to a wound. We report that c3a.1-/- zebrafish larvae have impaired neutrophil responses to both tail wounds and localized bacterial infections, as well as increased susceptibility to infection due to a neutrophil-intrinsic function of C3A. We further show that C3A enhances migration of human primary neutrophils to IL-8 and that c3a.1-/- larvae have impaired neutrophil migration in vivo, and a decrease in neutrophil directed migration speed early after wounding. Together, our findings suggest a role for C3A in mediating efficient neutrophil migration to damaged tissues and support the power of TRAP to identify cell-specific changes in gene expression associated with wound-associated inflammation.",

Nonetheless, chemoresistance remains a major cause of chemotherapy failure. New immunotherapeutic modalities such as anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade have shown promise; however, response to such strategies is highly variable across patients. Here, we show that our novel poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) based nanomicellar formulation of Resiquimod, an imidazoquinoline TLR 7/8 agonist, had a superior tumor inhibitory effect in a metastatic model of lung adenocarcinoma, relative to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy as well as platinum-based chemotherapy, which is the mainstay of treatment for NSCLC. Investigation of the in vivo immune status following Resiquimod PM (POx micellar formulation of Resiquimod) treatment showed that Resiquimod-based stimulation of antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment resulted in the mobilization of anti-tumor CD8+ immune response. Our study demonstrates the promise of optimally delivered and nano-formulated Resiquimod as a new immunomodulating therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Recent large-scale Ebola outbreaks, combined with improved follow-up of survivors, has permitted the observation of common long-term neurological sequelae in patients that have survived Ebola virus infection. To date there have been few studies into neurological infections by Ebola or related filoviruses, however, recent studies have isolated infectious virus from patients cerebrospinal fluid months after being discharged from the treatment facility.\n\nIn order to determine whether different filoviruses were capable of infecting human neurons, the human neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and M17, were chemically-differentiated into more neuron-like cells using established protocols. The neuron-like profiles of the differentiated cells were confirmed by the determination of expression of a range of neuron-specific markers. Zaire ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, and Marburg virus were serially-passaged in both cell lines to determine permissiveness of the cells, as well as permit the acquisition of adaptive mutations in the viral genomes. Whilst Marburg virus grew to high titres in both cell lines, Zaire ebolavirus only grew in SH-SY5Y cells, and Reston ebolavirus rapidly died out in both cell lines. Whole-genome sequencing of the passaged viruses revealed two consensus-level non-coding mutations in the SH-SY5Y-passaged Marburg virus. Viral growth kinetics were determined for pre- and post-passaging Zaire ebolavirus and Marburg virus in both human neuronal cell lines, as well as the human hepatocyte cell line, Huh7. Growth kinetics were similar for both the pre- and post-passaged viruses, suggesting that adaptive mutations were not required for efficient growth in these cells.\n\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that filoviruses are capable of infecting human neuron-like cells in a species-specific manner. Marburg virus-infected cells remained alive up to Day 21 post-infection, suggesting that long-term neurological sequelae following filovirus infection may be a result of direct neuronal infection, and that infection of neurons might contribute to viral persistence in survivors.\n\nAuthor SummaryFiloviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, have been traditionally considered \"haemorrhagic fever\" viruses, with infections causing bleeding and frequently death. Recent large-scale outbreaks in Africa have challenged these assumptions due to a significant number of patients reporting neurological symptoms sometimes months after infection. In many of these patients, virus was present at detectable levels in the fluid surrounding the brain. There has been significant debate about the ability of Ebola and Marburg viruses to infect and grow in human neurons (brain cells), and evidence has been lacking due to the lack of feasibility in taking brain samples. Our study demonstrates that both Zaire ebolavirus and Marburg virus are capable of infecting cells derived from human brains without needing to change, and without killing the cells. Reston ebolavirus, a related virus that appears not to cause disease in humans, was not able to grow efficiently in these cells. Our findings show that these viruses might be capable of living in the brains of survivors for long periods of time, similar to previous observations in the eye and testes. In addition, the response of the body to these infected cells might account for the neurological symptoms described by patients.",

    "abstract": "Grapheme-color synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when letters or numbers elicit an abnormal color sensation (e.g., printed black letters are perceived as colored graphemes). Grapheme-color synesthesia is typically reported following explicit presentation of graphemes. Very few studies have investigated color sensations in synesthesia in the absence of visual awareness. To address this issue, we took advantage of the dichoptic flash suppression paradigm to temporarily render a stimulus presented to one eye invisible. Synesthesic alphanumeric and non-synesthetic abstract stimuli were presented to 11 synesthete and 11 matched control participants in achromatic and chromatic experimental conditions. The test stimulus was first displayed to one eye and then masked following the sudden presentation of visual noise in the other eye. The time for an image to be perceived following the onset of the suppressive noise was calculated in each condition. Trials free of flash suppression but mimicking the perceptual suppression of the flash were also tested. Results showed that target detection by synesthetes was significantly better than by controls in the absence of flash suppression. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups when the test stimulus was interocularly suppressed, either for synesthetic or non-synesthetic stimuli. This study suggests that synesthesia can be associated with enhanced perception for overt recognition, but does not occur in the absence of visual awareness.",

    "abstract": "Generalization enables applying past experience to similar but nonidentical situations. Therefore, it may be essential for adaptive behaviors. Recent neurobiological observation indicates that the striatal dopamine system achieves generalization and subsequent discrimination by updating corticostriatal synaptic connections in differential response to reward and punishment. To analyze how the computational characteristics in this system affect behaviors, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning model with multilayer neural networks in which the synaptic weights of only the last layer are updated according to the prediction error. We set fixed connections between the input and hidden layers so as to maintain the similarity of inputs in the hidden-layer representation. This network enabled fast generalization, and thereby facilitated safe and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning tasks, compared to algorithms which do not show generalization. However, disturbance in the network induced aberrant valuation. In conclusion, the unique computation suggested by corticostriatal plasticity has the advantage of providing safe and quick adaptations to unknown environments, but on the other hand has the potential defect which can induce maladaptive behaviors like delusional symptoms of psychiatric disorders.\n\nAuthor summaryThe brain has an ability to generalize knowledge obtained from reward- and punishment-related learning. Animals that have been trained to associate a stimulus with subsequent reward or punishment respond not only to the same stimulus but also to resembling stimuli. How does generalization affect behaviors in situations where individuals are required to adapt to unknown environments? It may enable efficient learning and promote adaptive behaviors, but inappropriate generalization may disrupt behaviors by associating reward or punishment with irrelevant stimuli. The effect of generalization here should depend on computational characteristics of underlying biological basis in the brain, namely, the striatal dopamine system. In this research, we made a novel computational model based on the characteristics of the striatal dopamine system. Our model enabled fast generalization and showed its advantage of providing safe and quick adaptation to unknown environments. By contrast, disturbance of our model induced abnormal behaviors. The results suggested the advantage and the shortcoming of generalization by the striatal dopamine system.",

Each subject had to indicate the taste quality, and to rate the intensity and unpleasantness/pleasantness of each taste of the solutions. In the quad test, the 4 quadrants of the tongue surface were tested by dripping one concentration of sweet, sour, salty, or bitter solutions for 6 times.

We found that in the whole mouth taste test, the total correct identification score dropped with age. But identifying sweet and salty qualities was not affected by age. No differences were found between male and female, except women scored better than men for sweet quality in the age group of 40-59 years. The total correct identification score of the taste quad test also decreased with an increased age of the taste quad test, without gender differences.\n\nConclusionBoth age and gender affected the taste functions in healthy Taiwanese to some extent, and differences were dependent on age, tongue region, and taste quality.",

Our previous study obtained interspecific hybrids from the cross between a cytoplasmic male sterility line of Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana alata, and some of the hybrids were pollen sterile. Here, we conducted an in-depth cellular study to understand the cytological mechanism of pollen abortion in these hybrids (F1-D sterile) compared with pollen development in the fertile hybrids (F1-S sterile) from the same cross. The ultrastructure observation showed that the membrane of microspore in F1-D sterile hybrid was deficient at all represented developmental stages. Chromosome behavior during meiosis was studied by carbol fuchsin staining, which indicated that cytomixis, chromosome leakage and asymmetric callose wall deposition occurred with high frequency in the microsporocyte of F1-D sterile. The results of the ultrastructure and 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) analyses also showed that the cytoplasm and nucleus were unstable and extruded from F1-D sterile microspore during the developmental process, leading to mature pollen grains that were vacuous and collapsed in the aperture region. In addition, delayed tapetum degradation was also detected in the anther of F1-D sterile, and might be associated with irregular sporopollenin deposition in the aperture region of F1-D sterile pollen. Genetic unbalance and cytomembrane deficiency might both be responsible for the instability of the chromosome, nuclear and cytoplasm, and resulted in pollen abortion in F1-D sterile hybrids, and irregular tapetum degradation might also be related with pollen sterility.",

Physical landcover types, including mangrove vegetation, influence polychaete and avifauna habitat uses. The connections between the physical to biota-associated landscapes warrant investigation. We determine how to best describe the landscape in a mangrove-vegetated wetland according to the physical, polychaete and bird domains and identify what physical attributes would affect the biota-associated landscapes. Differences among the physical and biota-associated landscapes were evaluated using multivariate ordination analyses. Six physical landcover types were aligned along elevation, inundation and sedimentary gradients. The polychaete-associated landscape was structured by three landcover types, mainly mangroves and tidal flats with intermediate and high inundation. Deposit-feeding spionid and nereid, carnivorous goniadid and suspension-feeding sabellid polychaetes depended on the different landcover types. Shorebirds occurred distinctively in tidal flats with large, open surface areas. Egrets characterized tidal flats and mangroves, and foliage and ground gleaners characterized mangroves. Open tidal flats are crucial to polychaetes, which are the main prey of shorebirds and are also important to egret foraging. Our results suggest that effective management strategies for conserving these migratory birds require the maintenance of open tidal flats in the landscape.",
