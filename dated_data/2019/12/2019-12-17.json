    "abstract": "In RNA-seq data processing, short read alignments are usually of one species against its own genome; however, in plant-microbe interaction systems, reads from both host and pathogen samples are blended together. In contrast to single-genome, both pathogen and host reference genomes are involved in the alignment process. In such circumstances, the order of alignment to the host, the pathogen, or simultaneously to both genomes results in differences in read counts of certain genes, especially at the advanced infection stage. It is crucial to have an appropriate strategy for aligning the reads to their respective genomes, yet the existing strategies of either sequential or parallel alignment become a problem when mapping mixed reads to their corresponding reference genomes. The challenge lies in the determination of which reads belong to which species, especially when homology exists between the two genomes.\n\nThis study proposes a combo-genome alignment strategy after comparing three alignment scenarios. Simulation results demonstrated that the degree of discrepancy in the results is correlated with phylogenetic distance of the two species in the mixture which was attributable to the extent of homology between the two genomes involved. This correlation was also found in the analysis using two real RNA-seq datasets of Fusarium-challenged wheat plants. Comparisons of the three RNA-seq processing strategies on three simulation datasets and two real Fusarium-infected wheat datasets showed that an alignment to a combo-genome, consisting of both host and pathogen genomes, improves mapping quality as compared to sequential alignment procedures.",

    "abstract": "The long-term morbidity of tendon disease in an increasingly active and ageing population represents a growing area of unmet clinical need. Tendon disorders commonly affect the lower limb, ranging from isolated tendon rupture to degenerative joint deformity. In the absence of valid animal models of chronic tendinopathy, traditional methods to isolate and identify crucial sub types involved in disease are limited by the heterogeneity of tendon cells, by their relative paucity in tissue and by the density of the surrounding collagen matrix. To overcome this, we have used next generation CITE-sequencing to combine surface proteomics with in-depth, unbiased gene expression analysis of single cells derived ex vivo from healthy and diseased tendon.\n\nFor the first time we have been able to show that human tendon consists of at least eight sub-populations of cells. In addition to endothelial cells, Tc cells, and macrophages, there are five distinct tenocyte populations expressing COL1A genes. These consist of a population of resident cells expressing microfibril associated genes (FBN1, VCAN, DCN, EMILIN1, MFAP5), a group of SCX+ cells co-expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory markers, a population of APOD+ fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), TPPP3/PRG4+ chondrogenic cells (COMP, CILP, PRG4) and ITGA7+ Smooth Muscle-Mesenchymal Cells, recently described in mouse muscle but not, as yet, in human tendon. Surface proteomic analysis identified markers by which these sub-classes could be isolated and targeted in future.\n\nIn comparison to healthy tendon, diseased tendon harboured a greater proportion of SCX+ tendon cells and these expressed high levels of pro-inflammatory markers including CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL8, PDPN and previously undescribed PTX3. We were also able to show that whereas disease associated genes such as CD248 and PDPN were expressed by COL1+ tenocytes, IL33 was restricted to endothelial cells of chronically diseased tendon.",

In recent years, the ppGpp-specific hydrolase, metazoan SpoT homolog-1 (Mesh1), was shown to have important roles for growth under nutrient deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster. Curiously, however, ppGpp has never been detected in animal cells, and therefore the physiological relevance of this molecule, if any, in metazoans has not been established. Here, we report the detection of ppGpp in Drosophila and human cells and demonstrate that ppGpp accumulation induces metabolic changes, cell death, and eventually lethality in Drosophila. Our results provide the first evidence of the existence and function of the ppGpp-dependent stringent response in animals.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating, converging evidence indicates that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) appears to be the transmodal hub for semantic representation. A series of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) investigations utilizing the  virtual lesion approach have established the brain-behavioural relationship between the ATL and semantic processing by demonstrating that inhibitory rTMS over the ATL induced impairments in semantic performance in healthy individuals. However, a growing body of rTMS studies suggest that rTMS might also be a tool for cognitive enhancement and rehabilitation, though there has been no previous exploration in semantic cognition. Here, we explored a potential role of rTMS in enhancing and inhibiting semantic performance with contrastive rTMS protocols (1Hz vs. 20Hz) by controlling practice effects. Our results demonstrated that it is possible to modulate semantic performance positively or negatively depending on the ATL stimulation frequency: 20Hz rTMS was optimal for facilitating cortical processing (faster RT in a semantic task) contrasting with diminished semantic performance after 1Hz rTMS. In addition to cementing the importance of the ATL to semantic representation, our findings suggest that 20Hz rTMS leads to semantic enhancement in healthy individuals and potentially could be used for patients with semantic impairments as a therapeutic tool.",

Yet, ants sometimes drag heavy food items backward to the nest and it is still unclear to what extent they rely on visual memories while doing so. In this study displacement experiments and alterations of the visual scenery reveal that ants do indeed recognise and use the learnt visual scenery to guide their path while walking backward. In addition, the results show that backward homing ants estimate their directional certainty by combining visual familiarity with other cues such as their path integrator and the time spent backward. A simple model that combines path integration with repulsive and attractive visual memories captures the results.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in diagnosis and management, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death in the US. Atherosclerosis is the most common form of CVD and the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to rupture is a primary determinant for risk of catastrophic ischemic events. Current imaging of atherosclerotic disease focuses on assessing plaque size and the degree of luminal stenosis, which are not good predictors of plaque stability. Functional methods to identify biomarkers of inflammation in plaques could facilitate assessment of plaque instability to allow early intervention. In this study, we validate the use of a purpose-built, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible positron emission tomography (PET) insert for multimodal, molecular imaging of vulnerable plaques in mice. We illustrate the application of PET to screen for inflamed regions to guide the application of MRI. Molecular MRI visualizes regions of vascular inflammation and is coupled with anatomical MRI to generate detailed maps of the inflammatory marker within the context of an individual vessel. As a testbed for this imaging methodology, we developed a multimodal, iron oxide nanoparticle (NP) targeting vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) for simultaneous PET/MRI of vascular inflammation performed on a mouse carotid ligation model. In vitro cell studies confirmed that the NPs are not cytotoxic to liver cells. In vivo simultaneous PET/MRI imaging identified regions of inflammation. Three-dimensional rendering of the MRI data facilitated high-resolution visualization of patterns of inflammation along the injured vessel. Histology validated the co-localization of the NPs with VCAM-1 expression at sites of induced inflammation. The results of this work validate the utility of the simultaneous PET/MR insert as a research tool for small animals and lays groundwork to further advance the potential clinical utility of integrated imaging systems.",

In addition to a full-length transcript, a truncated mRNA encoding only the N-terminal aconitase domain is produced by polyadenylation at an internal site. Protein products of the gene are found in the nucleus, mitochondria and cytoplasm, consistent with the presence of multiple subcellular targeting signals. To reconstruct the evolution of this complex gene, we studied homologous genes from a range of related species. We find evidence for a dynamic history within Taphrinomycotina, including: early evolution of a nuclear localization signal; creation of a 3 intron that could be involved in regulating subcellular targeting; evolution of multiple peroxisomal targeting signals in different lineages; and recurrent gene loss. We present a likely stepwise model for the evolution of this remarkable gene and discuss alternative scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus-(HIV) is group of the genus Lentivirus within the family of Retroviridae, subfamily Ortho retrovirinae. Based on genetic characteristics and differences in the viral antigens, HIV is classified into the types 1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2). HIV is identical single - stranded RNA molecule that are enclosed within the core of the virus particle proteins, the genome of the HIV Provirus, also known as DNA, is generated by the Protease against reverse transcriptase RNA genome into DNA, degradation of the RNA and integration of the double - stranded HIV DNA into the human genome. The aim of this study is to determine antigenic peptides from p10, p21, and p51 proteins that can be used for multiple peptide vaccine design using In-Silico study. A total of 73 sequences of three proteins were obtained from NCBI and subjected to multiple sequence alignments using CLUSTALW tool to determine conserved regions.\n\nImmune Epitope Data Base tools were used to determine B cell epitopes, these tools are Bepipred Linear B cell epitopes prediction, surface accessibility and antigenicity prediction. Epitope binding to MHC class I and class II and their population coverage were also determined using IEDB software. The analysis results are as follow, for B cell binding from p10 (708QGYSP712), from p21 (704QGYSP708, 73CVPTDPNPQ81) and (346\"FKNL349) from p51. All these peptides have high score in Linear B cell epitopes prediction, surface accessibility and antigenicity prediction. On another hand peptides that reacted to MHC class I were (47EANTTLFCA55, 53FCASDAKAY61, 55,ASDAKAYET63) form p10,(38YYGVPVWKE46, 10PQEVFLVNV18 and 29AAGSTMGAA37) from p21 and (63\"EWEFVNTPP71, 70PPLVKLWYQ78 and 79EKEPIVGA87) from p51 protein respectively. It worth noting that the peptides (119IISLWDQSL127, 108CVKLTPLCV116) from p10, (38YYGVPVWKE46, 20LLQYWSQEL34, 16FNMWKNNMV30) from p21 and (7WKGSPAIFQ21, 11WEFVNTPPL25 and 58 FLWMGYELH72) protein is also binds to MHC class II with high affinity. All T cell peptides had highest population coverage, and the combined coverage for all peptides in this study was found to be 100%. Using In-Silico studies will ensure less risk of virulence and side effects. Evaluation of antibodies response in animal models is needed to confirm efficacy of these epitopes in inducing protective immune response.",

We found no differences in body condition between habitats and no evidence of malnutrition at either site. However, urban squirrels had higher blood glucose, lower potassium, phosphorus, chloride, and albumin:globulin ratios.

    "abstract": "Rapid glacier recession is altering the physical conditions of headwater streams. Stream temperatures are predicted to rise and become increasingly variable, putting entire meltwater-associated biological communities at risk of extinction. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand how thermal stress affects mountain stream insects, particularly where glaciers are likely to vanish on contemporary timescales. In this study, we tested the critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) of stonefly nymphs representing multiple species and a range of thermal regimes in the high Rocky Mountains, USA. We then collected RNA-sequencing data to assess how organismal thermal stress translated to the cellular level. Our focal species included the meltwater stonefly, Lednia tumana, which was recently listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act due to climate-induced habitat loss. For all study species, critical thermal maxima (CTMAX > 20{degrees}C) far exceeded the stream temperatures mountain stoneflies experience (< 10{degrees}C). Moreover, while evidence for a cellular stress response was present, we also observed constitutive expression of genes encoding proteins known to underlie thermal stress (i.e., heat shock proteins) even at low temperatures that reflected natural conditions. We show that high-elevation aquatic insects may not be physiologically threatened by short-term exposure to warm temperatures and that longer term physiological responses or biotic factors (e.g., competition) may better explain their extreme distributions.",

    "abstract": "To segregate chromosomes in mitosis, cells assemble mitotic spindle, a molecular machine with centrosomes at two opposing cell poles and chromosomes at the equator. Microtubules and molecular motors connect the poles to kinetochores, specialized protein assemblies on the centromere regions of the chromosomes. Bipolarity of the spindle is crucial for the proper cell division, and two centrosomes in animal cells naturally become two spindle poles. Cancer cells are often multi-centrosomal, yet they are able to assemble bipolar spindles by clustering centrosomes into two spindle poles. Mechanisms of this clustering are debated. In this study, we computationally screen effective forces between a) centrosomes, b) centrosomes and kineto-chores, c) centrosomes and chromosome arms, d) centrosomes and cell cortex, to understand mechanics that determines three-dimensional spindle architecture. To do this, we use stochastic Monte Carlo search for stable mechanical equilibria in effective energy landscape of the spindle. We find that the following conditions have to be met to robustly assemble the bipolar spindle in a multi-centrosomal cell: 1) strengths of centrosomes attraction to each other and to the cell cortex have to be proportional to each other; 2) strengths of centrosomes attraction to kinetochores and repulsion from the chromosome arms have to be proportional to each other. We also find that three other spindle configurations emerge if these conditions are not met: a) collapsed, b) monopolar, c) multipolar spindles, and the computational screen reveal mechanical conditions for these abnormal spindles.\n\nSignificance statementTo segregate chromosomes, cells assemble bipolar mitotic spindle. Multiple mechanical forces generated by microtubules and molecular motors in the spindle govern the spindle architecture, but it is unclear what force balances support the bipolarity of the spindle. This problem is especially difficult and important in cancer cells, which often have multiple centrosomes that somehow are able to cluster into two spindle poles. By using stochastic energy minimization in an effective energy landscape of the spindle and computationally screening forces, we find mechanical conditions for mono-, multi- and bi-polar spindles. We predict how microtubule and motor parameters have to be regulated in mitosis in multi-centrosomal cells.",

Extracellular matrix (ECM) components in animals include heparan-sulfate proteoglycans, which are analogs of bacterial peptidoglycan and thus potentially involved in the extracellular distribution of Shh. We found that the zinc-coordination fold of Shh is required for its association with ECM as well as for non-cell autonomous signaling. Association with the ECM requires the presence of at least 0.1 M zinc and is prevented by mutations affecting critical conserved catalytical residues as well as extracellular calcium.

    "abstract": "Inner hair cells (IHCs) are the primary receptors for hearing. They are housed in the cochlea and convey sound information to the brain via synapses with the auditory nerve. IHCs have been thought to be electrically and metabolically independent from each other. We report that, upon developmental maturation, 30% of the IHCs are electrochemically coupled in  mini-syncytia. This coupling permits transfer of fluorescently-labeled metabolites and macromolecular tracers. The membrane capacitance, Ca2+-current, and resting current increase with the number of dye-coupled IHCs. Dual voltage-clamp experiments substantiate low resistance electrical coupling. Pharmacology and tracer permeability rule out coupling by gap junctions and purinoceptors. 3D-electron-microscopy indicates instead that IHCs are coupled by membrane fusion sites. Consequently, depolarization of one IHC triggers presynaptic Ca2+-influx at active zones in the entire mini-syncytium. Based on our findings and modeling, we propose that IHC-mini-syncytia enhance sensitivity and reliability of cochlear sound encoding.",

    "abstract": "Many medical advancements - including improvements to anti-rejection therapies in transplantation and vaccine development - rely on pre-clinical studies conducted in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II genes of cynomolgus macaques are orthologous to human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) class I and class II genes, respectively. Both encode cell-surface proteins involved in cell recognition and rejection of non-host tissues. MHC class I and class II genes are highly polymorphic, so comprehensive genotyping requires the development of complete databases of allelic variants. Our group used PacBio circular consensus sequencing of full-length cDNA amplicons to characterize MHC class I and class II transcript sequences for a cohort of 295 Indonesian cynomolgus macaques (ICM) in a large, pedigreed breeding colony. These studies allowed us to expand the existing database of Macaca fascicularis (Mafa) alleles by identifying an additional 141 MHC class I and 61 class II transcript sequences. In addition, we defined co-segregating combinations of allelic variants as regional haplotypes for 70 Mafa-A, 78 Mafa-B and 45 Mafa-DRB gene clusters. Finally, we defined class I and class II transcripts that are associated with 100 extended MHC haplotypes in this breeding colony by combining our genotyping analyses with short tandem repeat (STR) patterns across the MHC region. Our sequencing analyses and haplotype definitions improve the utility of these ICM for transplantation studies as well as infectious disease and vaccine research.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in mitochondrial numbers and function are present in large cerebral arteries, but it is unclear whether these differences extend to the microcirculation. We performed an assessment of mitochondria-related proteins in cerebral microvessels (MVs) isolated from young, male and female, Sprague-Dawley rats. MVs composed of arterioles, capillaries, and venules were isolated from the cerebrum and used to perform a 3 vs. 3 quantitative, multiplexed proteomics experiment utilizing tandem mass tags (TMT), coupled with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). MS data and bioinformatic analyses were performed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We identified a total of 1,969 proteins, of which 1,871 were quantified by TMT labels. Sixty-four proteins were expressed significantly (p < 0.05) higher in female samples compared with male samples. Females expressed more mitochondrial proteins involved in energy production, mitochondrial membrane structure, anti-oxidant enzyme proteins, and those involved in fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, males had higher expression levels of mitochondria-destructive proteins. We validated our key Proteomics results with western blotting. Our findings reveal, for the first time, the full extent of sexual dimorphism in the mitochondrial metabolic protein profiles of MVs, which may contribute to sex-dependent cerebrovascular and neurological pathologies.\n\nSynopsisEnergy-producing proteins in the cerebral microvessels (MVs) of male and female rats were examined by quantitative discovery-based proteomics to gain insight into the sex-dependent etiology of cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

In the current study we report the baseline episodic memory task fMRI results from the PRe-symptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimers Disease (PREVENT-AD) study in Montreal, Canada, in which 327 healthy older adults, within 15 years of the parents conversion to AD, were scanned. During the task fMRI protocol volunteers were scanned as they encoded and retrieved object-location spatial source associations. The task was designed to discriminate between brain activity related to successful spatial source recollection and failures in spatial source recollection, with memory for only item (object) memory. Multivariate task-related partial least squares (task PLS) was used to test the hypothesis that +APOE4 adults with a family history of AD would exhibit altered patterns of brain activity in the recollection-related memory network, comprised of medial frontal, parietal and medial temporal cortices, compared to APOE4 non-carriers (-APOE4). We also tested for group differences in the correlation between event-related brain activity and memory performance in +APOE4 compared to -APOE4 adults using behavioral-PLS (B-PLS). We found group similarities in memory performance and in task-related brain activity in the recollection network. However, the B-PLS results indicated there were group differences in brain activity-behavior correlations in ventral occipito-temporal, medial temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices during episodic encoding. These findings are consistent with previous literature on the influence of APOE4 on brain activity and provide new perspective on potential gene-based differences in brain-behavior relationships in people with parental history of AD. Future research should further investigate the potential to distinguish risk of AD development based on memory performance and associated patterns of brain activity.",

    "abstract": "Plants possess hundreds of intracellular immune receptors encoding nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Autoactive NLRs, in some cases a specific NLR domain, induce plant cell death in the absence of pathogen infection. In this study, we identified a group of NLRs (G10) carrying autoactive coiled-coil (CC) domains in pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. CM334) by genome-wide transient expression analysis. The G10-CC-mediated cell death mimics hypersensitive response (HR) cell death triggered by interaction between NLR and effectors derived from pathogens. Sequence alignment and mutagenesis analyses revealed that the intact 1 helix of G10-CCs is critical for both G10-CC- and R gene-mediated HR cell death. The cell death induced by G10-CCs does not require known helper NLRs, suggesting G10-NLRs are novel singleton NLRs. We also found that G10-CCs localize in the plasma membrane as Arabidopsis singleton NLR ZAR1. Extended studies revealed that autoactive G10-CCs are well conserved in other Solanaceae plants, including tomato, potato, and tobacco, as well as a monocot plant, rice. Furthermore, G10-NLR is an ancient form of NLR that present in all tested seed plants (spermatophytes). Our studies not only uncover the autonomous NLR cluster in plants but also provide powerful resources for dissecting the underlying molecular mechanism of NLR-mediated cell death in plants.",

    "abstract": "Progress in shortening the duration of tuberculosis (TB) treatment is hampered by the lack of a predictive model that accurately reflects the diverse environment within the lung. This is important as TB has been shown to produce distinct localisations to different areas of the lung during different disease stages, with the environmental heterogeneity within the lung of factors such as air ventilation, blood perfusion and oxygen tension believed to contribute to the apical localisation witnessed during the post-primary form of the disease.\n\nBuilding upon our previous model of environmental lung heterogeneity, we present a networked metapopulation model that simulates TB across the whole lung, incorporating these notions of environmental heterogeneity across the whole TB life-cycle to show how different stages of the disease are influenced by different environmental and immunological factors. The alveolar tissue in the lung is divided into distinct patches, with each patch representing a portion of the total tissue and containing environmental attributes that reflect the internal conditions at that location. We include populations of bacteria and immune cells in various states, and events are included which determine how the members of the model interact with each other and the environment. By allowing some of these events to be dependent on environmental attributes, we create a set of heterogeneous dynamics, whereby the location of the tissue within the lung determines the disease pathological events that occur there.\n\nOur results show that the environmental heterogeneity within the lung is a plausible driving force behind the apical localisation during post-primary disease. After initial infection, bacterial levels will grow in the initial infection location at the base of the lung until an adaptive immune response is initiated. During this period, bacteria are able to disseminate and create new lesions throughout the lung. During the latent stage, the lesions that are situated towards the apex are the largest in size, and once a post-primary immune-suppressing event occurs, it is the uppermost lesions that reach the highest levels of bacterial proliferation. Our sensitivity analysis also shows that it is the differential in blood perfusion, causing reduced immune activity towards the apex, which has the biggest influence of disease outputs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe distribution of protein stability effects is known to be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution from previous empirical fits. Starting from first-principles statistical mechanics, we more rigorously motivate this empirical observation by deriving per residue protein stability effects to be Gaussian. Our derivation requires the number of amino acids to be large, which is satisfied by the standard set of 20 amino acids found in nature. No assumption is needed on the protein length or the number of residues in close proximity in space, in contrast to previous applications of the central limit theorem to protein energetics. We support our derivation results with computational and experimental data on mutant protein stabilities across all types of protein residues.\n\nStatement of SignificanceDefining the distribution of single mutant stability effects ({Delta}{Delta}Gs) is the first step in modeling the role protein stability plays in evolution. Although empirical fits have been made to elucidate its form, a complete theoretical understanding of {Delta}{Delta}G distributions is lacking. Here, we derive how a simple Gaussian form can arise, while still including the intricacies of protein sequence and structure. We backup our derivation with previously released computational and experimental {Delta}{Delta}Gs.",

    "abstract": "We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of histone H3 and H4 residues in the regulation of chronological lifespan in yeast, and identify four structural groups in the nucleosome that influence lifespan. We also identify residues where substitution with an epigenetic mimic extends lifespan, providing evidence that a simple epigenetic switch, without possible additional background modifications, causes longevity. Residues where substitution result in the most pronounced lifespan extension are all on the exposed face of the nucleosome, with the exception of H3E50, which is present on the lateral surface, between two DNA gyres. Other residues that have a more modest effect on lifespan extension are concentrated at the extremities of the H3-H4 dimer, suggesting a role in stabilizing the dimer in its nucleosome frame. Residues that reduce lifespan are buried in the histone handshake motif, suggesting that these mutations destabilize the octamer structure.\n\nAll residues exposed on the nucleosome disk face and that cause lifespan extension are known to interact with Sir3. We find that substitution of H4K16 and H4H18 cause Sir3 to redistribute from telomeres and silent mating loci to secondary positions, often enriched for Rap1, Abf1 or Reb1 binding sites, whereas H3E50 does not. The redistribution of Sir3 in the genome can be reproduced by an equilibrium model based on primary and secondary binding sites with different affinities for Sir3. The redistributed Sir3 cause transcriptional repression at most of the new loci, including of genes where null mutants were previously shown to extend chronological lifespan. The transcriptomic profiles of H4K16 and H4H18 mutant strains are very similar, and compatible with a DNA replication stress response. This is distinct from the transcriptomic profile of H3E50, which matches strong induction of oxidative phosphorylation. We propose that the different groups of residues are involved in binding to heterochromatin proteins, in destabilizing the association of the nucleosome DNA, disrupting binding of the H3-H4 dimer in the nucleosome, or disrupting the structural stability of the octamer, each category impacting on chronological lifespan by a different mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cortex is populated by neurons derived from neural progenitors located throughout the embryonic telencephalon. Excitatory neurons are derived from progenitors located in the dorsal telencephalon, while inhibitory interneurons are generated by ventral telencephalic progenitors. The transcriptional regulator PRDM16 is expressed by radial glia, neural progenitors present in both regions; however, its mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. It is unclear if PRDM16 functions plays a role in neurogenesis in both dorsal and ventral progenitor lineages, and if so, whether it does so by regulating common or unique networks of genes. Here, we show that Prdm16 expression in MGE progenitors is required for maintaining their proliferative capacity and for the production of proper numbers of pallial GABAergic interneurons. PRDM16 binds to cis-regulatory elements and represses the expression of region-specific neuronal differentiation genes, thereby controlling the timing of neuronal maturation. Our results highlight the importance of PRDM16 for the development of both excitatory and inhibitory cortical circuits. We demonstrate the existence of convergent developmental gene expression programs regulated by PRDM16, which utilize both common and region-specific sets of genes in the cortex and the MGE to control the proliferative capacity of neural progenitors, ensuring the generation of correct numbers of cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Norovirus is the major cause of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Lack of structural information on infection and replication mechanisms hampers the development of effective vaccines and remedies. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the capsid structure of murine noroviruses changes in response to aqueous conditions. By twisting the flexible hinge connecting two domains, the protruding (P) domain reversibly rises off the shell (S) domain in solutions of higher pH, but rests on the S domain in solutions of lower pH. Metal ions help to stabilize the latter conformation in this process. Furthermore, in the resting conformation, the cellular receptor CD300lf is readily accessible, and thus infection efficiency is significantly enhanced. Two P domain conformations were also found in the human norovirus GII.3 capsid. These results provide new insights into the infection mechanisms of the non-envelope viruses that function in dramatic environmental changes such as the digestive tract.\n\nSignificance StatementThe capsid structures of caliciviruses have been reported to be classified into two different types, according to species and genotype. One is the rising P domain type as shown in human norovirus GII.10 and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, where the P domain rises from the S domain surface. The other is the resting P domain type as shown in human norovirus GI.1, sapovirus and San Miguel sea lion virus, where the P domain rests upon the S domain. Here, we demonstrate that the P domain of the murine norovirus infectious particles changes reversibly between the rising and resting P domain types in response to aqueous conditions.

We found that during the differentiation of ASC the levels of 14-3-3 acK49/51 increase showing that inhibition of 14-3-3 is necessary for this process. Among the 7 paralogs of this family, the inhibition by this posttranslational modification occurs mostly on the paralog {beta} located specifically in the nucleus where 14-3-3 was described to binds to H3 histone and many transcription factors. Short hairpin RNA silencing of 14-3-3{beta} gene but not 14-3-3{gamma} increases significantly the osteogenic potential of the cells.

Although genomic sequences are available for many of the human-associated bacteria from commonly tested body habitats (e.g. stool), as few as 13% of bacterial-derived reads from other sites such as the skin map to known bacterial genomes. To facilitate a better characterization of metagenomic shotgun reads from under-represented body sites, we collected over 10,000 bacterial isolates originating from 14 human body habitats, identified novel taxonomic groups based on full length 16S rRNA sequences, clustered the sequences to ensure that no individual taxonomic group was over-selected for sequencing, prioritized bacteria from under-represented body sites (such as skin, respiratory and urinary tract), and sequenced and assembled genomes for 665 new bacterial strains. Here we show that addition of these genomes improved read mapping rates of HMP metagenomic samples by nearly 30% for the previously under-represented phylum Fusobacteria, and 27.5% of the novel genomes generated here had high representation in at least one of the tested HMP samples, compared to 12.5% of the sequences in the public databases, indicating an enrichment of useful novel genomic sequences resulting from the prioritization procedure. As our understanding of the human microbiome continues to improve and to enter the realm of therapy developments, targeted approaches such as this to improve genomic databases will increase in importance from both an academic and clinical perspective.\n\nImportanceThe human microbiome plays a critically important role in health and disease, but current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the varying microbiome and the different host environments is lacking. Having access to a database of fully sequenced bacterial genomes provides invaluable insights into microbial functions, but currently sequenced genomes for the human microbiome have largely come from a limited number of body sites (primarily stool), while other sites such as the skin, respiratory tract and urinary tracts are under-represented, resulting in as little as 13% of bacterial-derived reads mapping to known bacterial genomes. Here, we sequenced and assembled 665 new bacterial genomes, prioritized from a larger database to select under-represented body sites and bacterial taxa in the existing databases. As a result, we substantially improve mapping rates for samples from the Human Microbiome Project and provide an important contribution to human bacterial genomic databases for future studies.",

    "abstract": "SERCA1a is an ATPase calcium pump that transports Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Sarcolipin (SLN), a transmembrane peptide, regulates the activity of SERCA1a by decreasing its Ca2+ transport rate, but its mechanism of action is still not well understood. To decipher this mechanism, we have performed normal modes analysis in the all-atom model, with the SERCA1a-SLN complex or the isolated SERCA1a embedded in an explicit membrane. The comparison of the results allowed us to provide an explanation for the action of SLN that is in good agreement with experimental observations. In our analyses, the presence of SLN locally perturbs the TM6 transmembrane helix and as a consequence modifies the position of D800, one of the key metal-chelating residues. Additionally, it reduces the flexibility of the gating residues, V304 and E309 in TM4, at the entrance of the Ca2+ binding sites, which would decrease the affinity for Ca2+. Unexpectedly, SLN has also an effect on the ATP binding site more than 35 [A] away, due to the straightening of TM5, a long helix considered as the spine of the protein. The straightening of TM5 modifies the structure of the P-N linker that sits above it, and which comprises the 351DKTG354 conserved motif, resulting in an increase of the distance between ATP and the phosphorylation site. As a consequence, the turn-over rate could be affected. All this gives SERCA1a the propensity to go toward a Ca2+-deprived E2-like state in the presence of SLN and toward a Ca2+ high-affinity E1-like state in the absence of SLN, although the SERCA1a-SLN complex was crystallized in an E1-like state. In addition to a general mechanism of inhibition of SERCA1a regulatory peptides, this study also provides an insight in the conformational transition between the E2 and E1 states.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe role of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase in muscle relaxation is essential. Impairment of its function may result in either cardiac diseases, or myopathies, and also thermogenesis defects. Inhibition of the ATPase by regulatory peptide such as sarcolipin remains unclear. The structure of the ATPase in complex with this peptide was studied by all-atom normal modes analysis, an in silico technique which allows us to decipher the mechanism of inhibition of calcium transport by sarcolipin at a molecular level. Our results open the way to understanding the impact of in vivo misregulation of the ATPase activity by sarcolipin. Development of tools enhancing or preventing interaction between the ATPase and its regulatory peptide could be considered as new therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Humans do not have an accurate representation of probability information in the environment but distort it in a surprisingly stereotyped way (\"probability distortion\"), as shown in a wide range of judgment and decision-making tasks. Many theories hypothesize that humans automatically compensate for the uncertainty inherent in probability information (\"representational uncertainty\") and probability distortion is a consequence of uncertainty compensation. Here we examined whether and how the representational uncertainty of probability is quantified in the human brain and its relevance to probability distortion behavior. Human subjects kept tracking the relative frequency of one color of dot in a sequence of dot arrays while their brain activity was recorded by magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found converging evidence from both neural entrainment and time-resolved decoding analysis that a mathematically- derived measure of representational uncertainty is automatically computed in the brain, despite it is not explicitly required by the task. In particular, the encodings of relative frequency and its representational uncertainty respectively occur at latencies of approximately 300 ms and 400 ms. The relative strength of the brain responses to these two quantities correlates with the probability distortion behavior. The automatic and fast encoding of the representational uncertainty provides neural basis for the uncertainty compensation hypothesis of probability distortion. More generally, since representational uncertainty is closely related to confidence estimation, our findings exemplify how confidence might emerge prior to perceptual judgment.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of the maximum of diversity within the smallest number of accessions is one of the challenges of germplasm management. To construct core-collections, the assessment of the population structure and the relationships between the accessions represents a key step and the choice of suitable molecular markers is the starting point. Since the expansion of available SNP-based genomics tools, a debate has emerged regarding the usefulness of the widely used microsatellites (SSRs) markers. In this study, we analysed a part of the INRAE walnut germplasm collection of 150 accessions, unique in Europe for walnut biodiversity conservation, by comparing the power of both types of marker. We found that the first level of structure is equally detected using 13 SSRs or the Axiom J. regia 700K SNP array, and is in relation with the geographical origin of the accessions. For K=2, there was no exchange of accession between the two groups when both markers were compared. We also highlighted empirically that approximately 100 SNPs are needed to obtain similar clustering to SSRs in Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). The neighbor-joining trees constructed were also consistent between both types of marker. The main differences lied in the upper levels of structure from K=3 to K=6, more powerful using the SNPs, and in the percentage of the explained variation in PCoA for K=2, higher using SSRs. We then constructed core-collections of 50 accessions, a crucial step in genetic resources management to reduce the costs and preserve the allelic diversity. Using two different construction methods, both SSR and SNP markers were suitable and able to keep at least 88.57% of the alleles. 32/50 accessions were in common between the two markers, for both methods. We concluded that the use of either marker is dependent on the researchers goal.",

    "abstract": "Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim. (TK) is a dioecious plant in the Cucurbitaceae for which different sexes have separate medicinal uses. In order to study the genes related to sex determination, transcriptome sequencing was performed on flower buds and leaves of male and female plants using the high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 145,975 unigenes and 7110 DEGs were obtained. There were 6776 DEGs annotated to 1234 GO terms and enriched to 18 functional groups, including five biological processes related to sugar metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in hormone transduction, hormone synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. The sex determination genes of TK are different from known sex determination mechanisms (ACS11, ACS7(2), WIP1). Many DEGs of TK are involved in reproductive organ formation, hormone signal transduction and regulatory networks. In combination with the previous study of sex differentiation of Cucurbitaceae, the results of GO, KEGG and the expression of related genes in male and female plants, 18 candidate genes for sex determining of TK were screened from 151 hormone-related differentially expressed genes. The genes included MYB80, MYB108 and MYB21 of the MYB family, CER1, CBL, ABCB199, SERK1 and HSP81-3. The results provide a foundation for the study of sex differentiation in TK.",

    "abstract": "Species of the genus Flavivirus are widespread in Brazil and are a major public health concern. The city of Sao Paulo is in a highly urbanized area with some green spaces which are used for recreation and where potential vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors of these arboviruses can be found, a scenario that can contribute to the transmission of flaviviruses to humans. This study therefore sought to investigate natural flavivirus infection in mosquitoes collected in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area (EPA) in the south of the city. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from March 2016 to April 2017 with CO2-baited CDC light traps. Specimens were identified morphologically and grouped in pools. A total of 260 pools of non-engorged females were inoculated into the C6/36 cell lineage after analysis by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). IFA-positive specimens were tested by qRT-PCR with genus-specific primers targeting a region of ~260 nucleotides in the flavivirus NS5 gene, and the PCR products were sequenced to confirm and identify the flavivirus species. Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii and Wyeomyia (Prosopolepis) confusa were the most frequent species collected. Zika virus (ZIKV) nucleotide sequences were detected in three mosquito species, An. cruzii, Limatus durhami and Wy. confusa, and dengue virus 2 (DENV-2) sequences in Culex. spp. and Culex. (Mel.) vaxus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural isolation of DENV-2 and ZIKV in sylvatic species of mosquitoes in the Capivari-Monos EPA. Our findings suggest that DENV-2 is present in Culex mosquitoes, and ZIKV in Anopheles, Wyeomyia and Limatus. The flavivirus species identified here are of medical importance; surveillance is therefore recommended in this EPA, where vertebrates and mosquitoes can act as flavivirus hosts and vectors.",

This study aimed to screen for sarcopenia and fall risk in a sample of Parkinsons disease (PD) patients and to investigate demographic and clinical factors associated.\n\nMethodsThis is a cross-sectional study. We evaluated 218 PD patients at the Movement Disorders Clinic in Fortaleza, Brazil, and collected clinical data including experiencing falls in the six months prior to their medical visit. Probable sarcopenia diagnosis was confirmed by using a sarcopenia screening tool (SARC-F questionnaire) and the presence of low muscle strength.\n\nResultsOne hundred and twenty-one patients (55.5%) were screened positive for sarcopenia using the SARC-F and 103 (47.4%) met the criteria for probable sarcopenia. Disease duration, modified Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale score, levodopa equivalent dose, probable sarcopenia and positive SARC-F screening were all associated with experiencing falls in the prior six months. Disease duration, lower quality of life and female gender were independently associated with sarcopenia. Experiencing falls in the prior six months was significantly more frequent among patients screened positive in the SARC-F compared to those screened negative.\n\nConclusionsSarcopenia and PD share common pathways and may affect each others prognosis and patients quality of life. Since sarcopenia is associated with lower quality of life and increased risk of falls, active case finding, diagnosis and proper management of sarcopenia in PD patients is essential.",

    "abstract": "Prions are pathogens formed from abnormal conformers (PrPSc) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC). PrPSc conformation to disease phenotype relationships extensively vary among prion strains. In particular, prions exhibit a strain-specific tropism for lymphoid tissues. Prions can be composed of several substrain components. There is evidence that these substrains can propagate in distinct tissues (e.g. brain and spleen) of a single individual, providing an experimental paradigm to study the cause of prion tissue selectivity. Previously, we showed that PrPC expression levels govern prion substrain selection in the brain. Transmission of sheep scrapie isolates (termed LAN) to multiple lines of transgenic mice expressing varying levels of ovine PrPC in the brain resulted in the phenotypic expression of the dominant sheep substrain in mice expressing near physiological PrPC levels, whereas a minor substrain replicated preferentially on high-expressors. Considering that PrPC expression levels are markedly decreased in the spleen compared to the brain, we interrogate whether spleen PrPC dosage could drive prion selectivity. The outcome of the transmission of a large cohort of LAN-like scrapie isolates in the spleen from high-expressors correlated with the replication rate dependency on PrPC amount; There was a prominent spleen colonization by the substrain preferentially replicating on low-expressors and a relative incapacity of the substrain with higher-PrPC level need to propagate in the spleen. Early colonization of the spleen allowed neuropathological expression of the lymphoid substrain after intraperitoneal inoculation. In addition, a pair of substrain variants resulting from the adaptation of human prions to ovine high-expressors, and exhibiting differing brain versus spleen tropism, showed different tropism on transmission to low-expressors, with the lymphoid substrain colonizing the brain. Overall, these data suggest that PrPC expression levels are instrumental in prion substrain lymphotropism.\n\nAuthor summaryThe cause of prion phenotype variation among prion strains remains poorly understood. In particular prions replicate in a strain-dependent manner in the spleen. This can result in prion asymptomatic carriers. Based on our previous observations that dosage of the prion precursor (PrP) determined prion substrain selection in the brain, we examine whether PrP levels in the spleen could drive prion replication in this tissue, due to the low levels of the protein. We observe that the prion substrain with higher PrP need for replication did barely replicate in the spleen, while the component with low PrP need replicated efficiently. In addition, other human co-propagating prions with differing spleen and brain tropism showed different tropism on transmission to mice expressing low PrP levels, with the lymphoid substrain colonizing the brain. PrPC expression levels may thus be instrumental in prion tropism for the lymphoid tissue. From a diagnostic point of view, given the apparent complexity of prion diseases with respect to prion substrain composition, these data advocate to type extraneural tissues or fluids for a comprehensive identification of the circulating prions in susceptible mammals.",
