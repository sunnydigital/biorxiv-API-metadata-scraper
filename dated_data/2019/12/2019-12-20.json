    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMeasurement of stimulus-induced dopamine release and other types of transient neurotransmitter response (TNR) from dynamic PET images typically suffers from limited detection sensitivity and high false positive rates. Measurement of TNR of a voxel-level can be particularly problematic due to high image noise. In this work, we perform voxel-level TNR detection using artificial neural networks (ANN) and compare their performance to previously used standard statistical tests. Different ANN architectures were trained and tested using simulated and real human PET imaging data, obtained with the tracer [11C]raclopride (a D2 receptor antagonist). A distinguishing feature of our approach is the use of \"personalized\" ANNs that are designed to operate on the image from a specific subject and scan. Training of personalized ANNs was performed using simulated images that have been matched with the acquired image in terms of the signal and noise.\n\nIn our tests of TNR detection performance, the F-test of the linear parametric neurotransmitter PET (lp-ntPET) model fit residuals was used as the reference method. For a moderate TNR magnitude, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves in simulated tests were 0.64 for the F-test and 0.77-0.79 for the best ANNs. At a fixed false positive rate of 0.01, the true positive rates were 0.6 for the F-test and 0.8-0.9 for the ANNs. When applied to a real image, the ANNs identified a TNR cluster missed by the F-test. The newly found cluster was verified to contain TNR by direct lp-ntPET model fitting. These results demonstrate that personalized ANNs may offer a greater detection sensitivity of dopamine release and other types of TNR compared to previously used methods.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria invest in a slow-growing subpopulation, called persisters, to ensure survival in the face of uncertainty. This hedging strategy is remarkably similar to financial hedging, where diversifying an investment portfolio protects against economic uncertainty. We provide a new theoretical foundation for understanding cellular hedging by unifying the study of biological population dynamics and the mathematics of financial risk management through optimal control theory. Motivated by the widely accepted role of volatility in the emergence of persistence, we consider several novel models of environmental volatility described by continuous-time stochastic processes. This allows us to study an emergent cellular hedging strategy that maximizes the expected per-capita growth rate of the population. Analytical and simulation results probe the optimal persister strategy, revealing results that are consistent with experimental observations and suggest at new opportunities for experimental investigation and design. Overall, we provide a new way of conceptualising and modelling cellular decision-making in volatile environments by explicitly unifying theory from mathematical biology and finance.",

This paradigm considers only interactions of genes through expressed transcription factors and does not incorporate chromatin modification processes. This paper introduces a mathematical model that seamlessly combines gene regulatory networks and DNA methylation, with the goal of quantitatively characterizing the contribution of epigenetic regulation to gene silencing. The \"Basin of Attraction percentage\" is introduced as a metric to quantify gene silencing abilities. As a case study, a computational and theoretical analysis is carried out for a model of the pluripotent stem cell circuit as well as a simplified self-activating gene model. The results confirm that the methodology quantitatively captures the key role that methylation plays in enhancing the stability of the silenced gene state.",

    "abstract": "The success of goal-directed behaviours relies on the coordinated execution of a sequence of component actions. In young animals, such sequences may be poorly coordinated, but with age and experience, behaviour progressively adapts to efficiently exploit the animals ecological niche. How experience impinges on the developing neural circuits of behaviour is an open question. As a model system, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) hold enormous potential for studying both the development of behaviour and the underlying circuits, but no relevant experience-dependent learning paradigm has yet been characterized. To address this, we have conducted a detailed study of the effects of experience on the ontogeny of hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. We report that larvae with prior prey experience consume considerably more prey than naive larvae. This is mainly due to increased capture success that is also accompanied by a modest increase in hunt rate. We identified two components of the hunting sequence that are jointly modified by experience. At the onset of the hunting sequence, the orientation strategy of the turn towards prey is modified such that experienced larvae undershoot prey azimuth. Near the end of the hunt sequence, we find that experienced larvae are more likely to employ high-speed capture swims initiated from longer distances to prey. Combined, these modified turn and capture manoeuvrers can be used to predict the probability of capture success and suggest that their development provides advantages specific to larvae feeding on live-prey. Our findings establish an ethologically relevant paradigm in zebrafish for studying how the brain is shaped by experience to drive the ontogeny of efficient behaviour.",

Our work is motivated by tree inference algorithms, such as maximum likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, where the geometry of the search space plays a central role for efficiency and practicality of optimisation and sampling. We hence focus on understanding the geometry of the space (graph) of ranked trees, the so-called ranked nearest neighbour interchange (RNNI) graph. We find the radius and diameter of the space exactly, improving the best previously known estimates. Since the RNNI graph is a generalisation of the classical nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) graph to ranked phylogenetic trees, we compare geometric and algorithmic properties of the two graphs. Surprisingly, we discover that both geometric and algorithmic properties of RNNI and NNI are quite different. For example, we establish convexity of certain natural subspaces in RNNI which are not convex is NNI. Our results suggest that the complexity of computing distances in the two graphs is different.",

    "abstract": "Despite numerous advances in our understanding of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) genetics and biology, this disease is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related U.S. deaths within the next few years. Incomplete understanding of how it arises precludes development of early detection and interception strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. Acinar to ductal metaplasia involving genesis of tuft cells is one early step in PDA formation, but their functional significance has remained obscure due to their rarity and a lack of methods and relevant animal models for their molecular and functional analysis. Here, we show that deletion of tuft cell master regulator Pou2f3 eliminates pancreatic tuft cells and increases fibrosis, alters immune cell activation, and accelerates disease progression. We demonstrate that tuft cell expression of the prostaglandin D2 synthase Hpgds restrains pancreatic disease progression in early stages by inhibiting stromal activation. Analyses of human data sets are consistent with mouse studies. We propose that tuft cells and, by inference, the associated metaplastic lesions, play a protective role early in pancreatic tumorigenesis.\n\nSignificanceWe find that tuft cell formation in response to oncogenic Kras is protective and restrains tumorigenesis through local production of anti-inflammatory substances, including paracrine prostaglandin D2 signaling to the stroma.

Here we show that self-maintaining PNS macrophages share unique features with CNS microglia. By comparing gene expression across neural and conventional tissue-resident macrophages, we identified transcripts that were shared among neural resident macrophages as well as selectively enriched in PNS macrophages. Remarkably, PNS macrophages constitutively expressed genes previously identified to be upregulated by activated microglia during aging or neurodegeneration. Several microglial activation-associated and PNS macrophage-enriched genes were also expressed in spinal cord microglia at steady state. While PNS macrophages arose from both embryonic and hematopoietic precursors, their expression of activation-associated genes did not differ by ontogeny. Collectively, these data uncover shared and unique features between neural resident macrophages and emphasize the role of nerve environment for shaping PNS macrophage identity.",

Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that opportunistically causes a severe inflammatory pneumonia in humans, called Legionnaires Disease, via replication within macrophages. Previous studies demonstrated that tea polyphenols attenuate L. pneumophila intracellular replication within mouse macrophages via amplification of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Sorghum bicolor is a sustainable and resilient cereal crop that thrives in arid environments and is well suited to continued production in warming climates. Polyphenols derived from sorghum have anticancer and antioxidant properties, but their antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated. Here, we investigated the impact of sorghum polyphenols on L. pneumophila intracellular replication within RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. We discovered that sorghum high-polyphenol extract (HPE) treatment attenuates L. pneumophila intracellular replication in a dose-dependent manner. Sorghum HPE did not impair bacterial replication in vitro or impact macrophage viability. Moreover, in contrast to tea polyphenols, HPE treatment impaired TNF secretion from infected macrophages. Thus, polyphenols derived from sorghum enhance macrophage restriction of L. pneumophila by a novel mechanism. This work provides a foundation for the use of sorghum as an antimicrobial agent.",

    "abstract": "Bovine digital dermatitis (DD), is a highly prevalent disease among dairy cattle characterized by ulcerative and painful lesions. While multiple management factors are involved in the disease, its precise etiology remains uncertain and the effectiveness of current control strategies remains highly variable. The major role of Treponema spp. in the development of the disease is consistently recognized. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how other bacterial communities are relevant to the onset and progression of the disease, and how the skin microbiota is affected by the environment during the course of the disease. The objective of this study was to describe the dynamics of microbiota recovered from DD affected feet under field conditions. This study described the diversity, structure, and composition of DD lesion microbiota over 45 days according to different clinical and management factors. The results of this investigation confirmed the existence of a specific skin microbiota associated with DD lesions, dominated by Treponema spp. and very different from the microbiota of healthy skin. Interestingly, the diversity and structure of the microbiota in DD lesions did not vary with the footbath disinfectant or the individual topical antibiotic treatments used. In addition, microbiotas from proliferative lesions evidenced a different structure and diversity in comparison to non-proliferative lesions. Our results confirm the major role of Treponema spp. And highlight the potential role of Mycoplasmopsis spp. in the DD lesion onset. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the clinical course of DD lesions is driven by a particular microbiota and how that microbiota may induce disease.\n\nHighlightsMultiple bacteria have been identified in DD lesions. However, many of these microorganisms are inhabitants of the foot skin and the farm environment. For the first time, the microbiota of DD lesions was monitored for 45 days under field conditions to describe its evolution over time. The results of this investigation highlighted a particular microbiota dominated by Treponema spp. present on the skin of DD affected animals and highly different from those microbiotas of healthy skin. The microbiota of DD lesions evolved over the study period and differential bacteria were identified. Further studies are warranted to determine the role of the bacteria composing these microbiotas on lesion onset and outcome.",

However, key players that impact this genome reorganization remain largely unknown. Here, we report that removal of special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2), a nuclear protein that binds matrix attachment regions, is a key event in initiating myogenic differentiation. Deletion of SATB2 in muscle cell culture models and in vivo, accelerates differentiation and depletes the muscle progenitor pool, respectively. Genome wide analysis indicates that SATB2 binding is both repressive and inductive, as loss of SATB2 leads to expression of differentiation regulatory factors and inhibition of genes that impair this process. Finally, we noted that the differentiation-specific decline in SATB2 protein is dependent on a caspase 7-mediated cleavage event. Taken together, this study demonstrates that temporal control of SATB2 protein is critical for shaping the chromatin environment and coordinating the myogenic differentiation program.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/883579v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12ca82corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d50a56org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@99ba7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a216e3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

To determine these relative contributions, or spectral weights, listeners were asked to judge the lateralization of stimuli consisting of eleven simultaneously presented 1-ERB-wide noise bands centered between 442 Hz and 5544 Hz and separated by 1-ERB-wide gaps. Interaural disparities were applied to each noise band and were roved independently on every trial. The weights were obtained using a multiple linear regression analysis. In a second experiment the effect of temporal context on the spectral weights was investigated. Ten of the noise bands were used as pre- and postcursors and listeners were asked to lateralize the stimuli. Results show that only the lowest- or highest frequency band received highest weight for ITD and ILD, respectively. Temporal context led to significantly enhanced weights given to the band without the pre- and postcursor. The weight enhancement could only be observed at low frequencies, when determined with ITD cues and for low and high frequencies for ILDs. Hence, the auditory system seems to be able to change the spectral weighting of binaural information depending on the information content.\n\nPACS43.64.-q {middle dot} 43.64.+r {middle dot} 87.19.lt {middle dot} 43.66.-x {middle dot} 43.66.+y {middle dot} 43.64.Bt",

    "abstract": "Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are most prevalently used for producing recombinant therapeutics in biomanufacturing. Recently, more rational and systems approaches have been increasingly exploited to identify key metabolic bottlenecks and engineering targets for cell line engineering and process development based on the CHO genome-scale metabolic model which mechanistically characterizes cell culture behaviours. However, it is still challenging to quantify plausible intracellular fluxes and discern metabolic pathway usages considering various clonal traits and bioprocessing conditions. Thus, we newly incorporated enzyme kinetic information into the updated CHO genome-scale model (iCHO2291) and added enzyme capacity constraints within the flux balance analysis framework (ecFBA) to significantly reduce the flux variability in biologically meaningful manner, as such improving the accuracy of intracellular flux prediction. Interestingly, ecFBA could capture the overflow metabolism under the glucose excess condition where the usage of oxidative phosphorylation is limited by the enzyme capacity. In addition, its applicability was successfully demonstrated via a case study where the clone- and media-specific lactate metabolism was deciphered, suggesting that the lactate-pyruvate cycling could be beneficial for CHO cells to efficiently utilize the mitochondrial redox capacity. In summary, iCHO2296 with ecFBA can be used to confidently elucidate cell cultures and effectively identify key engineering targets, thus guiding bioprocess optimization and cell engineering efforts as a part of digital twin model for advanced biomanufacturing in future.",

    "abstract": "Conventional microbial cell cultivation techniques are typically labor intensive, low throughput, and poor parallelization, rendering them inefficient. The development of automated, modular microbial cell micro-cultivation systems, particularly those employing droplet microfluidics, has gained attention for their high-throughput, parallel and highly efficient cultivation capabilities. Here, we report the development of a microbial microdroplet culture system (MMC), which is an integrated platform for automated, high-throughput cultivation and adaptive evolution of microorganisms. We demonstrated that the MMC yielded both accurate and reproducible results for the manipulation and detection of droplets. The superior performance of MMC for microbial cell cultivation was validated by comparing the growth curves of six microbial strains grown in MMC, conventional shake flasks or well plates. The highest incipient growth rate for all six microbial cell lines was achieved using MMC. We also conducted an 18-day process of adaptive evolution of a methanol-essential Escherichia coli strain in MMC and obtained two strains exhibiting higher growth rates compared with the parent strain. Our study demonstrates the power of MMC to provide an efficient and reliable approach for automated, high-throughput microbial cultivation and adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "The cholesterol-sensing nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) and the glucose-sensing transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) are central players in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in liver. We have previously shown that LXR regulates ChREBP transcription and activity; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the current study, we demonstrate that LXR and ChREBP interact physically, and show a high co-occupancy at regulatory regions in the mouse genome. LXR co-activates ChREBP, and regulates ChREBP-specific target genes in vitro and in vivo. This co-activation is dependent on functional recognition elements for ChREBP, but not for LXR, indicating that ChREBP recruits LXR to chromatin in trans. The two factors interact via their key activation domains; ChREBPs low glucose inhibitory domain (LID) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of LXR. While unliganded LXR co-activates ChREBP, ligand-bound LXR surprisingly represses ChREBP activity on ChREBP-specific target genes. Mechanistically, this is due to a destabilized LXR:ChREBP interaction, leading to reduced ChREBP-binding to chromatin and restricted activation of glycolytic and lipogenic target genes. This ligand-driven molecular switch highlights an unappreciated role of LXR that was overlooked due to LXR lipogenesis-promoting function.",

Using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we demonstrate that the human subiculum also contains complementary laminar gene expression patterns similar to the mouse. In addition, we provide evidence that the molecular domain boundaries in human subiculum correspond to microstructural differences observed in high resolution MRI and fiber density imaging. Finally, we show both similarities and differences in the gene expression profile of subiculum pyramidal cells within homologous lamina.

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and its general transcription factors assemble on the promoters of mRNA genes to form large macromolecular complexes that initiate transcription in a regulated manner. During early transcription these complexes undergo dynamic rearrangement and disassembly as Pol II moves away from the start site of transcription and transitions into elongation. One step in disassembly is the release of the general transcription factor TFIIB, although the mechanism of release and its relationship to the activity of transcribing Pol II is not understood. We developed a single molecule fluorescence transcription system to investigate TFIIB release in vitro. Leveraging our ability to distinguish active from inactive complexes, we found that nearly all transcriptionally active complexes release TFIIB during early transcription. Release is not dependent on the contacts TFIIB makes with its recognition element in promoter DNA. We identified two different points in early transcription at which release is triggered, reflecting heterogeneity across the population of actively transcribing complexes. TFIIB releases after both trigger points with similar kinetics, suggesting the rate of release is independent of the molecular transformations that prompt release. Together our data support the model that TFIIB release is important to maintain the transcriptional activity of Pol II as initiating complexes transition into elongation complexes.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells display metabolic plasticity to survive metabolic and energetic stresses in the tumor microenvironment, prompting the need for tools to target tumor metabolism. Cellular adaptation to energetic stress is coordinated in part by signaling through the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Reducing LKB1-AMPK signaling exposes metabolic vulnerabilities in tumor cells with potential for therapeutic targeting. Here we describe that miRNA-mediated silencing of LKB1 (mediated by the oncogenic miRNA cluster miR-17[~]92) confers sensitivity of lymphoma cells to mitochondrial inhibition by biguanides. Using both classic (phenformin) and novel (IM156) biguanides, we demonstrate that Myc+ lymphoma cells with elevated miR-17[~]92 expression display increased sensitivity to biguanide treatment both in cell viability assays in vitro and tumor growth assays in vivo. This increased biguanide sensitivity is driven by miR-17-dependent silencing of LKB1, which results in reduced AMPK activation in response to bioenergetic stress. Mechanistically, biguanide treatment inhibits TCA cycle metabolism and mitochondrial respiration in miR-17[~]92-expressing tumor cells, targeting their metabolic vulnerability. Finally, we demonstrate a direct correlation between miR-17[~]92 expression and biguanide sensitivity in human cancer cells. Our results identify miR-17[~]92 expression as a potential biomarker for biguanide sensitivity in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\n\nOne Sentence SummarymiR-17[~]92 expression in Myc+ tumors sensitizes cancer cells to biguanide treatment by disrupting bioenergetic stability in lymphoma cells.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregates are the pathogenic hallmarks of many different neurodegenerative diseases and include the Lewy bodies found in Parkinsons disease. Aggresomes are closely-related cellular accumulations of misfolded proteins. They develop in a juxtanuclear position, adjacent to the centrosome, the microtubule organizing centre of the cell, and share some protein components. Despite the long-standing observation that aggresomes/Lewy bodies and the centrosome sit side-by-side in the cell, no studies have been done to see whether these protein accumulations impede the organelle function. We investigated whether the formation of aggresomes affected key centrosome functions: its ability to organize the microtubule network and to promote cilia formation. We find that when aggresomes are present, neuronal cells are unable to organise their microtubule network. New microtubules are not nucleated and extended, and the cells fail to respond to polarity cues. Since dopaminergic neurons are polarised, ensuring correct localisation of organelles and the effective intracellular transport of neurotransmitter vesicles, loss of centrosome activity could contribute to loss of dopaminergic function and neuronal cell death in Parkinsons disease. In addition, we provide evidence that many cell types, including dopaminergic neurons, cannot form cilia when aggresomes are present, which would affect their ability to receive extracellular signals.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal networks commonly referred to as central pattern generator (CPG) networks coordinate the generation of rhythmic activity like locomotion and respiration. These networks are proposed to exhibit a high degree of homology in their development. Their establishment is influenced by a variety of transcription factors. One of them is the Wilms tumor protein Wt1 that is present in dI6 neurons of the ventral spinal cord, which are involved in the coordination of locomotion. Here we report about the so far undescribed presence of Wt1 in neurons of the caudoventral medulla oblongata and their impact on respiration. By performing marker analyses, we were able to characterize these Wt1 positive (+) cells as dB4 neurons. The temporal pattern of Wt1 occurrence suggests a role for Wt1 in the differentiation of dB4 neurons during embryonic and postnatal development. Conditional knockout of Wt1 in these cells caused an altered population size of V0 neurons already in the developing hindbrain leading to a decline in the respiration rate in the adults. Thereby, we confirmed and extended the so far proposed homology between neurons of the dB4 domain in the hindbrain and dI6 neurons of the spinal cord in terms of development and function. Ablation of Wt1+ dB4 neurons resulted in the death of neonates due to the inability to initiate respiration suggesting a vital role for Wt1+ dB4 neurons in breathing. These results extend the role of Wt1 in the CNS and show that in addition to its function in differentiation of dI6 neurons it also contributes to the development of dB4 neurons in the hindbrain that are critically involved in the regulation of respiration.",

Our simulation provides this world representation holistically by identical information encoded as holographic wave patterns for all associative cortex regions. Observed circular activation in cell culture experiments provides building blocks from which such an integrative circuit can evolve just by excitation and inhibition transfer to neighbouring neurons. Large-scale grid-computing of the simulation brought no new emergent phenomena but rather linear gains and losses regarding performance. The circuit integrates perceptions and actions. The resulting simulation compares well with data from electrophysiology, visual perception tasks, and oscillations in cortical areas. Non-local, wave-like information processing in the cortex agrees well with EEG observations such as cortical alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Non-local information processing has powerful emergent properties, including key features of conscious information processing.",

We studied resting-state-functional-connectivity (rsfc) networks in rhesus monkeys with or without FPC; 86 cortical regions showed significant differences in inter-area rsfc measures in lesioned animals versus controls. K-means clustering showed these regions were organized into two distinct networks in lesioned animals, whereas the same areas clustered into four networks in control animals. These networks extended within and beyond prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that FPC is involved in mediating cortical networks in the primate brain, both within and beyond prefrontal cortex.

    "abstract": "As magnetization and semiconductor based storage technologies approach their limits, bio-molecules, such as DNA, have been identified as promising media for future storage systems, due to their high storage density (petabytes/gram) and long-term durability (thousands of years). Furthermore, nanopore DNA sequencing enables high-throughput sequencing using devices as small as a USB thumb drive and thus is ideally suited for DNA storage applications. Due to the high insertion/deletion error rates associated with basecalled nanopore reads, current approaches rely heavily on consensus among multiple reads and thus incur very high reading costs. We propose a novel approach which overcomes the high error rates in basecalled sequences by integrating a Viterbi error correction decoder with the basecaller, enabling the decoder to exploit the soft information available in the deep learning based basecaller pipeline. Using convolutional codes for error correction, we experimentally observed 3x lower reading costs than the state-of-the-art techniques at comparable writing costs.\n\nThe code, data and Supplementary Material is available at https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/nanopore_dna_storage.",

    "abstract": "While variant identification pipelines are becoming increasingly standardized, less attention has been paid to the pre-processing of variants prior to their use in bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS). Three nuances of variant pre-processing that impact downstream identification of genetic associations include the separation of variants at multiallelic sites, separation of variants in overlapping genes, and referencing of variants relative to ancestral alleles. Here we demonstrate the importance of these variant pre-processing steps on diverse bacterial genomic datasets and present prewas, an R package, that standardizes the pre-processing of multiallelic sites, overlapping genes, and reference alleles before bGWAS. This package facilitates improved reproducibility and interpretability of bGWAS results. Prewas enables users to extract maximal information from bGWAS by implementing multi-line representation for multiallelic sites and variants in overlapping genes. Prewas outputs a binary SNP matrix that can be used for SNP-based bGWAS and will prevent the masking of minor alleles during bGWAS analysis.

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous success of x-ray cryocrystallography over recent decades, the transfer of crystals from the drops where they grow to diffractometer sample mounts, remains a manual process in almost all laboratories. Here we describe the Shifter, a semi-automated microscope stage that offers an accessible and scalable approach to crystal mounting that exploits on the strengths of both humans and machines. The Shifter control software manoeuvres sample drops beneath a hole in a clear protective cover, for human mounting under a microscope. By allowing complete removal of film seals the tedium of cutting or removing the seal is eliminated. The control software also automatically captures experimental annotations for uploading to the users data repository, removing the overhead of manual documentation. The Shifter facilitates mounting rates of 100-240 crystals per hour, in a more controlled process than manual mounting, which greatly extends the lifetime of drops and thus allows for a dramatic increase in the number of crystals retrievable from any given drop, without loss of X-ray diffraction quality. In 2015 the first in a series of three Shifter devices was deployed as part of the XChem fragment screening facility at Diamond Light Source (DLS), where they have since facilitated the mounting of over 100,000 crystals. The Shifter was engineered to be simple, allowing for a low-cost device to be commercialised and thus potentially transformative as many research initiatives as possible.\n\nSynopsisA motorised X/Y microscope stage is presented that combines human fine motor control with machine automation and automated experiment documentation, to transform productivity in protein crystal harvesting.",

    "abstract": "The membrane protein Ankylosis homologue (ANKH, mouse orthologue: ANK) prevents mineralization of joint-space and articular cartilage. The accepted view is that ANKH mediates cellular release of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong physiological inhibitor of mineralization. Using global metabolite profiling, we identified citrate as the most prominent metabolite leaving HEK293 cells in an ANKH-dependent manner. Although PPi levels were increased in culture medium of HEK293-ANKH cells, PPi was formed extracellularly after release of ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates. Ankank/ank mice, which lack functional ANK, had substantially reduced concentrations of citrate in plasma and urine, while citrate was undetectable in urine of a human patient lacking functional ANKH. Bone hydroxyapatite of Ankank/ank mice also contained markedly reduced levels of citrate and PPi and displayed diminished strength. Together, our data show that ANKH is a crucial factor in extracellular citrate and PPi homeostasis that is essential for normal bone development.",

    "abstract": "An organisms ability to adapt to heat can be key to its survival. Cells adapt to temperature shifts by adjusting lipid desaturation levels and the fluidity of membranes in a process that is thought to be controlled cell autonomously. We have discovered that subtle, step-wise increments in ambient temperature can lead to the conserved heat shock response being activated in head neurons of C. elegans. This response is exactly opposite to the expression of the lipid desaturase FAT-7 in the worms gut. We find that the over-expression of the master regulator of this response, Hsf-1, in head neurons, causes extensive fat remodeling to occur across tissues. These changes include a decrease in FAT-7 expression and a shift in the levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane. These shifts are in line with membrane fluidity requirements to survive in warmer temperatures. We have identified that the cGMP receptor, TAX-2/TAX-4, as well as TGF-{beta}/BMP signaling, as key players in the transmission of neuronal stress to peripheral tissues. This is the first study to suggest that a thermostat-based mechanism can centrally coordinate membrane fluidity in response to warm temperatures across tissues in multicellular animals.",

    "abstract": "Although zebrafish embryos have been utilized to study ciliogenesis and to model polycystic kidney disease (PKD), adult zebrafish remain unexplored. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a zebrafish mutant of tmem67, a homologue of the mammalian causative gene for Meckel syndrome type 3 (MKS3). Although a small population of homozygous embryos exhibited pronephric cysts, all mutants were able to survive to adulthood and developed progressive mesonephric cysts with full penetrance. The cysts in the adult zebrafish kidneys manifested features of mammalian PKD, including switching of cyst origin from the proximal tubules to the collecting ducts, increased proliferation of cyst-lining epithelial cells, and hyperactive mTOR signaling. Consistent ciliary abnormalities were observed in both the embryonic and adult zebrafish mutants compared with the wild-type fish, including shorter and fewer single cilia in the distal pronephros and all segments of the mesonephros and greater numbers of multiciliated cells (MCCs). Lack of single cilium preceded cystogenesis, suggestive of a primary defect. Expansion of MCCs occurred after pronephric cyst formation and was inversely correlated with the severity of cystogenesis in young adult zebrafish, suggesting an adaptive action. Interestingly, mTOR inhibition ameliorated renal cysts in both the embryonic and adult zebrafish models; however, it only rescued ciliary abnormalities in the adult mutants. In summary, we have established a tmem67 mutant as the first adult zebrafish PKD model, revealed a novel aspect of cilium regulation, and identified sustained mTOR inhibition as a candidate therapeutic strategy for tmem67-based PKD.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile zebrafish embryos are well recognized for their value in studying ciliogenesis and polycystic kidney disease (PKD), adult zebrafish have not commonly been used. Here, we report the establishment of the first adult zebrafish model for PKD, which exhibits characteristics of mammalian PKD and shows kidney ciliary abnormalities consistent with those observed in an embryonic model. We also provide evidence for mTOR inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for this particular type of cystogenesis. Compared to the embryonic model, the adult fish model exhibits a spectrum of progressive pathogeneses and enables ciliary abnormalities to be discerned as either primary or secondary to cystogenesis. We believe that this novel adult fish model will facilitate mechanistic studies and therapeutic development for PKD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness. While around half of the genetic contribution to advanced AMD has been uncovered, little is known about the genetic architecture of the preceding early stages of the diseases.\n\nMethodsTo identify genetic factors for early AMD, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis with 14,034 early AMD cases and 91,214 controls from 11 sources of data including data from the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) and the UK Biobank (UKBB). We ascertained early AMD via color fundus photographs by manual grading for 10 sources and by using an automated machine learning approach for >170,000 images from UKBB. We searched for significant genetic loci in a genome-wide association screen (P<5x10-8) based on the meta-analysis of the 11 sources and via a candidate approach based on 13 suggestive early AMD variants from Holliday et al 2013 (P<0.05/13, additional 3,432 early AMD cases and 11,235 controls). For the novel AMD regions, we conducted in-silico follow-up analysis to prioritize causal genes and pathway analyses.\n\nResultsWe identified 11 loci for early AMD, 9 novel and 2 known for early AMD. Most of these 11 loci overlapped with known advanced AMD loci (near ARMS2/HTRA1, CFH, APOE, C2, C3, CETP, PVRL2, TNFRSF10A, VEGFA), except two that were completely novel to any AMD. Among the 17 genes within the two novel loci, in-silico functional annotation suggested CD46 and TYR as the most likely responsible genes. We found the presence or absence of an early AMD effect to distinguish known pathways of advanced AMD genetics (complement/lipid pathways or extracellular matrix metabolism, respectively).\n\nConclusionsOur data on early AMD genetics provides a resource comparable to the existing data on advanced AMD genetics, which enables a joint view. Our large GWAS on early AMD identified novel loci, highlighted shared and distinct genetics between early and advanced AMD and provides insights into AMD etiology. The ability of early AMD effects to differentiate the major pathways for advanced AMD underscores the biological relevance of a joint view on early and advanced AMD genetics.",

    "abstract": "DNA Polymerase Theta mediates an end joining pathway (TMEJ) that repairs chromosome breaks. It requires resection of broken ends to generate long, 3 single stranded DNA tails, annealing of complementary sequence segments (microhomologies) in these tails, followed by microhomology-primed synthesis sufficient to resolve broken ends. The means by which microhomologies are identified is thus a critical step in this pathway, but is not understood. Here we show microhomologies are identified by a scanning mechanism initiated from the 3 terminus and favoring bi-directional progression into flanking DNA, typically to a maximum of 15 nucleotides into each flank. Polymerase theta is frequently insufficiently processive to complete repair of breaks in microhomology-poor, AT-rich regions. Aborted synthesis leads to one or more additional rounds of microhomology search, annealing, and synthesis; this promotes complete repair in part because earlier rounds of synthesis generate microhomologies de novo that are sufficiently long that synthesis is more processive. Aborted rounds of synthesis are evident in characteristic genomic scars as insertions of 3-30 bp of sequence that is identical to flanking DNA (\"templated\" insertions). Templated insertions are present at higher levels in breast cancer genomes from patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, consistent with an addiction to TMEJ in these cancers. Our work thus describes the mechanism for microhomology identification, and shows both how it mitigates limitations implicit in the microhomology requirement, and generates distinctive genomic scars associated with pathogenic genome instability.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia (PC) are important signaling hubs in cells and their deregulation has been associated with various diseases including cancer. Here we explored the role of PC in colorectal cancer (CRC) and colitis. In the colon we found PC to be mostly present on different subtypes of fibroblasts. Colons of mice exposed to either chemically induced colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis (CAC) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis had decreased numbers of PC. We employed conditional knock-out strains for the PC essential genes, Kif3A and Ift88, to generate mice with reduced numbers of PC on colonic fibroblasts. These mice showed an increased susceptibility in the CAC model as well as in DSS-induced colitis. Colons from DSS-treated mice with PC-deficiency on fibroblasts displayed an elevated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and colonic epithelial cells had diminished levels of HES-1, a key transcription factor of Notch signaling. Notably, an analysis of PC presence on biopsies of patients with ulcerative colitis as well as CRC patients revealed decreased numbers of PC on colonic fibroblasts in pathological versus surrounding normal tissue. Taken together, we provide evidence that a decrease in colonic PC numbers promotes colitis and CRC.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/871772v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f8eccdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1829b3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d632aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9833b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "MYCN amplification drives one in six cases of neuroblastoma. The supernumerary gene copies are commonly found on highly rearranged, extrachromosomal circular DNA. The exact amplicon structure has not been described thus far and the functional relevance of its rearrangements is unknown. Here, we analyzed the MYCN amplicon structure and its chromatin landscape. This revealed two distinct classes of amplicons which explain the regulatory requirements for MYCN overexpression. The first class always co-amplified a proximal enhancer driven by the noradrenergic core regulatory circuit (CRC). The second class of MYCN amplicons was characterized by high structural complexity, lacked key local enhancers, and instead contained distal chromosomal fragments, which harbored CRC-driven enhancers. Thus, ectopic enhancer hijacking can compensate for the loss of local gene regulatory elements and explains a large component of the structural diversity observed in MYCN amplification.",

    "abstract": "Two-color flow cytometry(2cFCM) is the most accessible method for phenotyping parasite invasion. However, current protocols require samples of field isolates at [~]1% parasitemia for assay set-up, which are becoming more uncommon in low transmission settings. Current protocols, therefore, have to be adapted for low parasitemia if the method must have continued applicability in this era of elimination. Optimizing the protocol requires addressing; interference from young uninfected RBCs background fluorescence and biased phenotypes due to limited labeled RBCs availability and/or parasite density per assay. Here, we used SYBR Green I and CTFR Proliferation fluorescent dyes to set-up invasion assays with Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, Dd2 and field isolates cultures (diluted at 0.05% to 2.0% parasitemia) against varying unlabeled to labeled RBC ratios (1:1 to 1:4). We showed that a shorter SYBR Green I staining time of 20 minutes, down from 1hour, minimized background fluorescence from uninfected RBCs (mean= 0.03% events) and allowed 2cFCM to accurately quantify reinvasion for an assay at 0.02% parasitemia. An increase in labeled target RBCs to 1:3 per assays significantly increased heterologous reinvasion (p<0.001). This resulted in a 10% greater invasion inhibition by enzyme treatments (p<0.05). Strain-specific invasion phenotype could be accurately determined for samples with as low as 0.3% parasitemia. Samples above 0.8% parasitemia were less accurate. These findings show that invasion pathway phenotypes can be obtained for field samples with low parasitemia at greater sensitivity and reproducibility by increasing the proportion of labeled RBCs per assay by at least 2-fold what is in current methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe current bovine genomic reference sequence was assembled from the DNA of a Hereford cow. The resulting linear assembly lacks diversity because it does not contain allelic variation. Lack of diversity is a drawback of linear references that causes reference allele bias. High nucleotide diversity and the separation of individuals by hundreds of breeds make cattle ideally suited to investigate the optimal composition of variation-aware references.\n\nResultsWe augment the bovine linear reference sequence (ARS-UCD1.2) with variants filtered for allele frequency in dairy (Brown Swiss, Holstein) and dual-purpose (Fleckvieh, Original Braunvieh) cattle breeds to construct either breed-specific or pan-genome reference graphs using the vg toolkit. We find that read mapping is more accurate to variation-aware than linear references if pre-selected variants are used to construct the genome graphs. Graphs that contain random variants do not improve read mapping over the linear reference sequence. Breed-specific augmented and pan-genome graphs enable almost similar mapping accuracy improvements over the linear reference. We construct a whole-genome graph that contains the Hereford-based reference sequence and 14 million alleles that have alternate allele frequency greater than 0.03 in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. We show that our novel variation-aware reference facilitates accurate read mapping and unbiased sequence variant genotyping for SNPs and Indels.\n\nConclusionsWe developed the first variation-aware reference graph for an agricultural animal: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759712.

Here we present single-cell new transcript tagging sequencing (scNT-Seq), a method for massively parallel analysis of newly-transcribed and pre-existing RNAs from the same cell. This droplet microfluidics-based method enables high-throughput chemical conversion on barcoded beads, efficiently marking metabolically labeled newly-transcribed RNAs with T-to-C substitutions. By simultaneously measuring new and old transcriptomes, scNT-Seq reveals neuronal subtype-specific gene regulatory networks and time-resolved RNA trajectories in response to brief (minutes) versus sustained (hours) neuronal activation. Integrating scNT-Seq with genetic perturbation reveals that DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases may inhibit stepwise transition from pluripotent embryonic stem cell state to intermediate and totipotent two-cell-embryo-like (2C-like) states by promoting global RNA biogenesis. Furthermore, pulse-chase scNT-Seq enables transcriptome-wide measurements of RNA stability in rare 2C-like cells. Time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic analysis thus opens new lines of inquiry regarding cell-type-specific RNA regulatory mechanisms.",

We used sequencing approaches to better characterize sex determination and sex-chromosomes in goldfish.\n\nResultsOur results confirmed that sex determination in goldfish is a mix of environmental and genetic factors and that its sex determination system is male heterogametic (XX/XY). Using reduced representation (RAD-seq) and whole genome (pool-seq) approaches, we characterized sex-linked polymorphisms and developed male specific genetic markers. These male specific markers were used to distinguish sex-reversed XX neomales from XY males and to demonstrate that XX female-to-male sex reversal could even occur at a relatively low rearing temperature (18{degrees}C), for which sex reversal has been previously shown to be close to zero. We also characterized a relatively large non-recombining region ([~]11.7 Mb) on goldfish linkage group 22 (LG22) that contained a high-density of male-biased genetic polymorphisms. This large LG22 region harbors 373 genes, including a single candidate as a potential master sex gene, i.e., the anti-Mullerian hormone gene (amh). However, no sex-linked polymorphisms were detected in the goldfish amh gene or its 5 kb proximal promoter sequence.\n\nConclusionsThese results show that goldfish have a relatively large sex locus on LG22, which is likely the goldfish Y chromosome. The presence of a few XX males even at low temperature also suggests that other environmental factors in addition to temperature could trigger female-to-male sex reversal. Finally, we also developed sex-linked genetic markers in goldfish, which will be important for future research on sex determination and aquaculture applications in this species.",

    "abstract": "Endolithic microbial symbionts in the coral skeleton may play a pivotal role in maintaining coral health. However, compared to aerobic microorganisms, research on the roles of endolithic anaerobic microorganisms and microbe-microbe interactions in the coral skeleton are still in their infancy. In our previous study, we showed that a group of coral-associated Prosthecochloris (CAP), a genus of anaerobic green sulfur bacteria, was dominant in the skeleton of the coral Isopora palifera. Though CAP is diverse, the 16S rRNA phylogeny presents it as a distinct clade separate from other free-living Prosthecochloris. In this study, we build on previous research and further characterize the genomic and metabolic traits of CAP by recovering two new near-complete CAP genomes--Candidatus Prosthecochloris isoporaea and Candidatus Prosthecochloris sp. N1--from coral Isopora palifera endolithic cultures. Genomic analysis revealed that these two CAP genomes have high genomic similarities compared with other Prosthecochloris and harbor several CAP-unique genes. Interestingly, different CAP species harbor various pigment synthesis and sulfur metabolism genes, indicating that individual CAPs can adapt to a diversity of coral microenvironments. A novel near-complete SRB genome--Candidatus Halodesulfovibrio lyudaonia--was also recovered from the same culture. The fact that CAP and various sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) co-exist in coral endolithic cultures and coral skeleton highlights the importance of SRB in the coral endolithic community. Based on functional genomic analysis of Ca. P. sp. N1 and Ca. H. lyudaonia, we also propose a syntrophic relationship between the SRB and CAP in the coral skeleton.\n\nImportanceLittle is known about the ecological roles of endolithic microbes in the coral skeleton; one potential role is as a nutrient source for their coral hosts. Here, we identified a close ecological relationship between CAP and SRB. Recovering novel near-complete CAP and SRB genomes from endolithic cultures in this study enabled us to understand the genomic and metabolic features of anaerobic endolithic bacteria in coral skeletons. These results demonstrate that CAP members with similar functions in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolisms harbor different light-harvesting components, suggesting that CAP in the skeleton adapts to niches with different light intensities. Our study highlights the potential ecological roles of CAP and SRB in coral skeletons and paves the way for future investigations into how coral endolithic communities will respond to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles need to be recycled and refilled rapidly to maintain high-frequency synaptic transmission. However, little is known about the control of transport of neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles, which determines the contents of synaptic vesicles and the strength of synaptic transmission. Here we report that Na+ substantially accumulated in the calyx of Held terminals of mouse during high-frequency spiking. The activity-induced elevation of cytosolic Na+ activated vesicular Na+/H+ exchanger, facilitated glutamate loading into synaptic vesicles and increased quantal size of asynchronous released vesicles, but did not affect the vesicle pool size or release probability. Consequently, presynaptic Na+ increased the excitatory postsynaptic currents and was required to maintain the reliable high-frequency signal transmission from the presynaptic calyces to the postsynaptic MNTB neurons. Blocking Na+/H+ activity with EIPA decreased the postsynaptic current and caused failures in postsynaptic firing. Therefore, during high-frequency synaptic transmission, when large amounts of glutamate are released, Na+ accumulated in the terminals, activated vesicular Na+/H+ exchanger, and regulated glutamate loading as a function of the level of vesicle release.\n\nSignificant statementAuditory information is encoded by action potentials phase-locked to sound frequency at high rates. Large amount of synaptic vesicles are released during high-frequency synaptic transmission, accordingly, synaptic vesicles need to be recycled and refilled rapidly. We have recently found that a Na+/H+ exchanger expressed on synaptic vesicles promotes vesicle filling with glutamate. Here we showed that during high-frequency signaling, when massive vesicles are released, Na+ accumulates in terminals and facilitates glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicle. Na+ thus accelerates vesicle replenishment and sustains reliable synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are RNA N-glycosidases that depurinate a specific adenine residue in the conserved sarcin/ricin loop of 28S rRNA. These enzymes are widely distributed among plants and bacteria. Recently, we have described RIP genes in mosquitoes belonging to the Culicinae subfamily (Aedini and Culicini tribes). We have also shown that these genes are derived from a single event of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a prokaryotic donor. In the present work, we show the existence of two RIP encoding genes in the genome of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (a hemiptera species belonging to the Aleyrodidae family, distantly related to mosquitoes). Contamination artifacts were ruled out analyzing three independent Bemisia tabaci genome databases. In contrast to mosquitoes RIPs, the whitefly genes harbor introns and, according to transcriptomic evidence, are transcribed and spliced. Interestingly, phylogenetic inference combined with taxonomic distribution strongly supports that whitefly RIP genes are derived from an independent HGT event from a plant source. Our results suggest that RIP genes fill a functional niche in insects.",

Together, our data demonstrate that phenotypically, functionally, and developmentally distinct subsets of adaptive-like NK cells exist in human lung and blood.

    "abstract": "Extensive research into the microbial ecology of grapes near harvest, with a primary focus on yeasts, has improved our understanding of some components of variation that influence grapevine terroir. Metagenomic tools enable a broader exploration of the plant microbiome and components of variability due to such factors as year, location, management, and phenological stage. In 2014, to characterize the microbial changes of the grape surface over the course of the growing season in the Finger Lakes region of New York, we examined the epiphytic microbiome of grapes at five key phenological stages: pea-sized, bunch closure, Veraison, 15 Brix and harvest. This experiment was repeated in two subsequent years in the Finger Lakes, New York in 2015, and in Tasmania, Australia in 2016, to examine variability of regional terroir. We found significant shifts in taxa presence and relative taxa abundance between phenological timepoints, and determined that the epiphytic microbiome differed significantly not just between regions but also within a single region from one year to the next. These findings call into question the role of the phytobiome in the expression of terroir, as the phytobiome is dynamically responding to its environment, within and between years and locations. On the berry surface in particular, these dynamics are complicated by weather and management. Understanding that the grape surface microbiome is consistently changing may influence how we manage the berry epiphytic microbiome, potentially affecting disease management and vinification decisions.",

    "abstract": "Extensive work has demonstrated a decline in face recognition abilities associated with healthy aging. To date, however, there has been limited insight into the nature and the extent of aging-related alterations in internal face representations. Here, we sought to address these issues by using an image reconstruction approach that capitalizes on the structure of behavioral data to reveal the pictorial content of visual representations. To this end, healthy young and older adults provided similarity judgments with pairs of face images. Facial shape and surface features were subsequently derived from the structure of the data for each participant and combined into image reconstructions of facial appearance. Our findings revealed that image reconstruction was successful for every participant, irrespective of age. However, reconstruction accuracies of shape and surface information were lower for older individuals than young individuals. Specifically, facial features diagnostic for face perception, such as eye shape and skin tone, were reconstructed poorly in older adults relative to young adults. At the same time, we found that age-related effects only accounted for a relatively small proportion of individual variability in face representations. Thus, our results provide novel insight into age-related changes in visual perception, they account for the decline in facial recognition occurring with age and they demonstrate the utility of image reconstruction to uncovering internal representations across a variety of populations.",

    "abstract": "Structural information about protein-protein interactions, often missing at the interactome scale, is important for mechanistic understanding of cells and rational discovery of therapeutics. Protein docking provides a computational alternative to predict such information. However, ranking near-native docked models high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring problem, remains a critical challenge. Moreover, estimating model quality, also known as the quality assessment problem, is rarely addressed in protein docking. In this study the two challenging problems in protein docking are regarded as relative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one physics-inspired deep learning framework. We represent proteins and encounter complexes as intra- and inter-molecular residue contact graphs with atom-resolution node and edge features. And we propose a novel graph convolutional kernel that pool interacting nodes features through edge features so that generalized interaction energies can be learned directly from graph data. The resulting energy-based graph convolutional networks (EGCN) with multi-head attention are trained to predict intra- and inter-molecular energies, binding affinities, and quality measures (interface RMSD) for encounter complexes. Compared to a state-of-the-art scoring function for model ranking, EGCN has significantly improved ranking for a CAPRI test set involving homology docking; and is comparable for Score_set, a CAPRI benchmark set generated by diverse community-wide docking protocols not known to training data. For Score_set quality assessment, EGCN shows about 27% improvement to our previous efforts. Directly learning from structure data in graph representation, EGCN represents the first successful development of graph convolutional networks for protein docking.",

    "abstract": "The vacuolar protein sorting protein 41 (VPS41) is a neuroprotective protein in models of Parkinsons disease (PD). As part of the HOPS (Homotypic fusion and Protein Sorting) complex, VPS41 regulates fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes and autophagosomes. Independent of HOPS, VPS41 regulates transport of newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins and secretory proteins. Here we report two brothers with compound heterozygous mutations in VPS41 (VPS41R662* and VPS41S285P), born to healthy and non-consanguineous parents. Both patients displayed transient retinal dystrophy, ataxia and dystonia, with brain MRI findings of cerebellar atrophy and a thin saber-shape corpus callosum. Patient-derived fibroblasts contained enzymatically active lysosomes that were poorly reached by endocytic cargo and failed to attract the mTORC1 complex. Consequently, transcription factor TFE3, a driver of autophagy and lysosomal genes, showed continuous nuclear localization which resulted in elevated LC3-II levels and an impaired response to nutrient starvation. CRISPR/CAS VPS41 HeLa knockout cells showed a similar phenotype that could be rescued by wildtype VPS41 but not by VPS41S285P or VPS41R662*. mTORC1 inhibition was also seen after knockout of HOPS subunits VPS11 or VPS18. Regulated neuropeptide secretion in PC12 VPS41 knockout cells was rescued by VPS41S285P expression, indicating that this HOPS-independent function was preserved. Co-expression of the VPS41S285P and VPS41R662* variants in a C. elegans model of PD abolished the protective effect of VPS41 against -synuclein-induced neurodegeneration. We conclude that both disease-associated VPS41 variants specifically abrogate HOPS function, which leads to a delay in endocytic cargo delivery to lysosomes, mTORC1 inhibition and irresponsiveness to autophagic clues. Our studies signify a link between HOPS function and mTORC1 signaling and imply that HOPS function is required for the neuroprotective effect of VPS41 in PD.",

    "abstract": "Though seemingly bizarre, the dramatic post-embryonic transformation that occurs during metamorphosis is one of the most widespread and successful developmental strategies on the planet. The adaptive decoupling hypothesis (ADH) proposes that metamorphosis is an adaptation for optimizing expression of traits across life stages that experience opposing selection pressures. Similarly, sex-biased expression of traits is thought to evolve in response to sexually antagonistic selection. Both hypotheses predict that traits will be genetically decoupled among developmental stages and sexes, but direct comparisons between stage-specific and sex-specific decoupling are rare. Additionally, tests of the ADH have been hampered by a lack of suitable traits for among-stage comparisons and by uncertainties regarding how much decoupling is to be expected. To fill these voids, we characterize transcriptome-wide patterns of gene-expression decoupling in the hypermetamorphic and sexually dimorphic insect, Neodiprion lecontei. This species has three ecologically and morphologically distinct larval stages separated by molts, as well as a complete metamorphic transition that produces dimorphic adult males and females. Consistent with the ADH, we observe that: (1) the decoupling of gene expression becomes more pronounced as the ecological demands of developmental stages become more dissimilar and (2) gene-expression traits that mediate changing ecological interactions show stronger and more variable decoupling than expression traits that are likely to experience more uniform selection. We also find that gene-expression decoupling is more pronounced among major life stages than between the sexes. Overall, our results demonstrate that patterns of gene-expression decoupling can be predicted based on gene function and organismal ecology.",

    "abstract": "The neural code relates the activity of the nervous system to the activity of the muscles to the generation of behavior. To decipher it, it would be ideal to comprehensively measure the activity of the entire nervous system and musculature in a behaving animal. As a step in this direction, we used the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris to explore how physiological and environmental conditions alter the activity of the entire neural and muscle tissue and affect behavior. We used whole-body calcium imaging of neurons and muscle cells and studied the effect of temperature, media osmolarity, nutritional state and body size on body contractions.\n\nIn mounted Hydra, changes in temperature, nutrition or body size did not have a major effect on neural or muscle activity, or on behavior. But changes in media osmolarity altered body contractions, increasing them in hipo-osmolar media solutions and decreasing them in hyperosmolar media. Similar effects were seen in ectodermal, but not in endodermal muscle. Osmolarity also bidirectionally changed the activity of contraction bursts neurons, but not of rhythmic potential neurons.\n\nThese findings show osmolarity-dependent changes in neuronal activity, muscle activity, and contractions, consistent with the hypothesis that contraction burst neurons respond to media osmolarity, activating ectodermal muscle to generate contraction bursts. This dedicated circuit could serve as an excretory system to prevent osmotic injury. This work demonstrates the feasibility of studying the entire neuronal and muscle activity of behaving animals.\n\nSignificance StatementWe imaged whole-body muscle and neuronal activity in Hydra in response to different physiological and environmental conditions. Osmolarity bidirectionally altered Hydra contractile behavior. These changes were accompanied by corresponding changes in the activity of one neuronal circuit and one set of muscles. This work is a step toward comprehensive deciphering of the mechanisms of animal behavior by measuring the activity of all neurons and muscle cells.",

    "abstract": "Human brain development involves spatially and temporally heterogeneous changes, detectable across a wide range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Investigating the interplay between multimodal MRI and polygenic scores (PGS) for personality traits associated with mental disorders in youth may provide new knowledge about typical and atypical neurodevelopment. We derived independent components across cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and gray/white matter contrast (GWC) (n=2596, 3-23 years), and tested for associations between these components and age, sex and-, in a subsample (n=878), PGS for neuroticism. Age was negatively associated with a single-modality component reflecting higher global GWC, and additionally with components capturing common variance between global thickness and GWC, and several multimodal regional patterns. Sex differences were found for components primarily capturing global and regional surface area (boys>girls), but also regional cortical thickness. For PGS for neuroticism, we found weak and bidirectional associations with a component reflecting right prefrontal surface area. These results indicate that multimodal fusion is sensitive to age and sex differences in brain structure in youth, but only weakly to polygenic load for neuroticism.",

    "abstract": "In a stable environment the brain can minimize processing required for sensory input by forming a predictive model of the surrounding world and suppressing neural response to predicted stimuli. Unpredicted stimuli lead to a prediction error signal propagation through the perceptual network, and resulting adjustment to the predictive model. The inter-regional plasticity which enables the model-building and model-adjustment is hypothesized to be mediated via glutamatergic receptors. While pharmacological challenge studies with glutamate receptor ligands have demonstrated impact on prediction-error indices, it is not clear how inter-individual differences in the glutamate system affect the prediction-error processing in non-medicated state. In the present study we examined 20 healthy young subjects with resting-state proton MRS spectroscopy to characterize glutamate+glutamine (rs-Glx) levels in their Heschls gyrus (HG), and related this to HG functional connectivity during a roving auditory oddball protocol. No rs-Glx effects were found within the frontotemporal prediction-error network. Larger rs-Glx signal was related to stronger connectivity between HG and bilateral inferior parietal lobule during unpredictable auditory stimulation. We also found effects of rs-Glx on the coherence of default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) during unpredictable auditory stimulation. Our results demonstrate the importance of Glx in modulating long-range connections and wider networks in the brain during perceptual inference.",

    "abstract": "Skillful object lifting relies on scaling fingertip forces according to the objects weight. When no visual cues about weight are available, force planning relies on recent lifting experience. Recently, we showed that previously lifted objects also affect weight estimation, as objects are perceived to be lighter when lifted after heavy objects compared to light ones. Here, we investigated the underlying neural mechanisms mediating these effects. We asked participants to lift objects and estimate their weight. Simultaneously, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during the dynamic loading or static holding phase. Two subject groups received TMS of either the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) or lateral occipital area (LO), known to be important nodes in object grasping and perception. We hypothesized that TMS-induced disruption of aIPS and LO would alter force scaling and weight perception. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find effects of aIPS or LO stimulation on force planning or weight estimation caused by previous lifting experience. However, we found that TMS of both areas increased grip forces, but only when applied during dynamic loading, and decreased weight estimation, but only when applied during static holding, suggesting time-specific effects. Interestingly, our results also indicate that TMS over LO, but not aIPS, affected load force scaling specifically for heavy objects, which further indicates that planning of load and grip forces might be controlled differently. These findings provide new insights on the interactions between brain networks mediating action and perception during object manipulation.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYThis article provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying object lifting and perception. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation during object lifting, we show that effects of previous experience on force scaling and weight perception are not mediated by the anterior intraparietal sulcus nor the lateral occipital cortex (LO). In contrast, we highlight a unique role for LO in load force scaling, suggesting different brain processes for grip and load force scaling in object manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Careful removal of unwanted proteins is necessary for cell survival. The primary constitutive intracellular protease is the 26S proteasome complex, often found in equilibrium with its free catalytic subcomplex- the 20S core particle. Protein degradation by 26S is tightly regulated by prior ubiquitination of substrates, whereas 20S is amenable to substrates with an unstructured segment. Differentiating their contributions to intracellular proteolysis is challenging due to their common catalytic sites. Here, by chemically synthesizing a synoptic set of homogenous ubiquitinated proteins, we ascribe signature features to 20S function and demonstrate a unique property: degrading the ubiquitin-tag along with the target protein. Cryo-EM confirms that a ubiquitinated substrate can induce asymmetric conformational changes to 20S. Mass-spectrometry of intracellular peptidome under hypoxia and in human failing heart identifies the signature properties of 20S in cells. Moreover, the ability of 20S proteasome to clear toxic proteins rapidly, contributes to better survival under these conditions.",

    "abstract": "There is an ever increasing number of arthropod taxa shown to have polarization sensitivity throughout their compound eyes. However, the mechanisms underlying arthropod perception of polarized reflections from objects such as plants are not well understood. The small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, has been demonstrated to exploit foliar polarized reflections, specifically the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), to recognize host plants. The well-described visual system of P. rapae includes several photoreceptor types (red, green, blue) that are sensitive to polarized light. Yet, the mechanism underlying the behavioral responses of P. rapae to stimuli with different DoLPs remains unknown. To investigate potential mechanisms, we designed several two-choice behavioral bioassays, displaying plant images on paired LCD monitors which allowed for independent control of polarization, color and intensity. We found that shifts in image intensity had a similar effect on P. rapae preferences for stimuli dissimilar in DoLP and dissimilar in color, suggesting DoLP differences are perceived as color. When a DoLP choice was offered between plant images manipulated in a manner to minimizing the response of blue, red, or blue and red photoreceptors, P. rapae shifted its preference for DoLP, suggesting a role for red, green and blue polarization-sensitive photoreceptors. Modeling of P. rapae photoreceptor responses to test stimuli suggests that differential DoLP is not perceived solely as a color difference. Our combined results suggest that P. rapae females process and interpret polarization reflections in a way different from that described for other polarization-sensitive taxa.",

We show in simulation how realistic whisker maps can self-organize, by assuming that information is exchanged between adjacent cells only, under the guidance of gene expression gradients.

Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects, respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear, and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature, and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that the interdependence of host population susceptibility and climate drive dengue dynamics in a nonlinear and complex, yet predictable way.",

High degree of data sparsity in biological high-throughput single-cell data is generally handled with imputation methods that complete the data, but specific methods for scChIP-seq are lacking. We present SIMPA, a scChIP-seq data imputation method leveraging predictive information within bulk data from ENCODE to impute missing protein-DNA interacting regions of target histone marks or transcription factors.\n\nResultsImputations using machine learning models trained for each single cell, each target, and each genomic region accurately preserve cell type clustering and improve pathway-related gene identification on real data. Results on simulated data show that 100 input genomic regions are already enough to train single-cell specific models for the imputation of thousands of undetected regions. Furthermore, SIMPA enables the interpretation of machine learning models by revealing interaction sites of a given single cell that are most important for the imputation model trained for a specific genomic region. The corresponding feature importance values derived from promoter-interaction profiles of H3K4me3, an activating histone mark, highly correlate with co-expression of genes that are present within the cell-type specific pathways. An imputation method that allows the interpretation of the underlying models facilitates users to gain an even deeper understanding of individual cells and, consequently, of sparse scChIP-seq datasets.\n\nAvailability and implementationOur interpretable imputation algorithm was implemented in Python and is available at https://github.com/salbrec/SIMPA",

An Allee effect is known to reduce the loss of genetic diversity of expanding populations, by changing the nature of the expansion from \"pulled\" to \"pushed\". We study the impact of an Allee effect on the formation of an expansion load with a new model, in which individuals have the genetic structure of a Mullers ratchet. A key feature of Mullers ratchet is that the population fatally accumulates deleterious mutations due to the stochastic loss of the fittest individuals, an event called a click of the ratchet. We observe fast clicks of the ratchet at the colonization front owing to small population size, followed by a slow fitness recovery due to migration of fit individuals from the bulk of the population, leading to a transient expansion load. For large population size, we are able to derive quantitative features of the expansion wave, such as the wave speed and the frequency of individuals carrying a given number of mutations. Using simulations, we show that the presence of an Allee effect reduces the rate at which clicks occur at the front, and thus reduces the expansion load.",

    "abstract": "Demographic inference using the site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a common way to understand historical events affecting genetic variation. However, most methods for estimating demography from the SFS assume random mating within populations, precluding these types of analyses in inbred populations. To address this issue, we developed a model for the expected SFS that includes inbreeding by parameterizing individual genotypes using beta-binomial distributions. We then take the convolution of these genotype probabilities to calculate the expected frequency of biallelic variants in the population. Using simulations, we evaluated the models ability to co-estimate demography and inbreeding using one- and two-population models across a range of inbreeding levels. We also applied our method to two empirical examples, American pumas (Puma concolor) and domesticated cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), inferring models both with and without inbreeding to compare parameter estimates and model fit. Our simulations showed that we are able to accurately co-estimate demographic parameters and inbreeding even for highly inbred populations (F = 0.9). In contrast, failing to include inbreeding generally resulted in inaccurate parameter estimates in simulated data and led to poor model fit in our empirical analyses. These results show that inbreeding can have a strong effect on demographic inference, a pattern that was especially noticeable for parameters involving changes in population size. Given the importance of these estimates for informing practices in conservation, agriculture, and elsewhere, our method provides an important advancement for accurately estimating the demographic histories of these species.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is guided by the brain. Therefore, adaptations of brain structure and function are essential for animal survival, and each species differs in such adaptations. The brain of one individual may even differ between life stages, for instance as adaptation to the divergent needs of larval and adult life of holometabolous insects. All such differences emerge during development but the cellular mechanisms behind the diversification of brains between taxa and life stages remain enigmatic. In this study, we investigated holometabolous insects, where larvae differ dramatically from the adult in both behavior and morphology. As consequence, the central complex, mainly responsible for spatial orientation, is conserved between species at the adult stage, but differs between larvae and adults as well as between larvae of different taxa. We used genome editing and established transgenic lines to visualize cells expressing the conserved transcription factor retinal homeobox, thereby marking homologous genetic neural lineages in both the fly Drosophila melanogaster and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. This approach allowed us for the first time to compare the development of homologous neural cells between taxa from embryo to the adult. We found complex heterochronic changes including shifts of developmental events between embryonic and pupal stages. Further, we provide, to our knowledge, the first example of sequence heterochrony in brain development, where certain developmental steps changed their position within the ontogenetic progression. We show that through this sequence heterochrony, an immature developmental stage of the central complex gains functionality in Tribolium larvae. We discuss the bearing of our results on the evolution of holometabolous larval central complexes by regression to a form present in an ancestor.",

    "abstract": "In a context of rapid global change, one of the key components for the survival of species is their genetic adaptive potential. Many methods have been developed to identify adaptive genetic variants, but few tools were made available to integrate this knowledge into conservation management. We present here the SPatial Areas of Genotype probability (SPAG), using genotype-environment logistic associations to map the probability of finding beneficial variants in a study area. We define a univariate model predicting the spatial distribution of a single genotype, and three multivariate models allowing the integration of several genotypes, potentially associated with various environmental variables. We then integrate climate change projections to map the corresponding future distribution of genotypes. The analysis of the mismatch between current and future SPAGs makes it possible to identify a) populations that are better adapted to the future climate through the presence of genetic variants able to cope with future conditions, and b) vulnerable populations where genotype(s) of interest are not frequent enough for the individuals to adapt to the future climate. We validate the SPAG approach using simulations and we use it to study the potential adaptation of 161 Moroccan and 382 European goats to the bioclimatic conditions. In Morocco, using whole genome sequence data, we identify seven genomic regions strongly associated with the precipitation seasonality (WorldClim database). The predicted shift in SPAGs under a strong climate change scenario for 2070 highlights goat populations likely to be threatened by the expected increase in precipitation variation in the future. In Europe, we find genomic regions associated with low precipitation, the shift in SPAGs highlighting vulnerable populations not adapted to the very dry conditions expected in 2070. The SPAG methodology is successfully validated using cross-validations and provides an efficient tool to take the adaptive potential into account in general conservation frameworks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding for components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are frequently mutated in cancer, including inactivating mutations of PTEN and activating mutations of PIK3CA, encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit p110. PIK3CB, encoding p110{beta}, is rarely mutated, but can contribute to tumourigenesis in some PTEN-deficient tumours. The underlying molecular mechanisms are however poorly understood. By analysing cell lines and annotated clinical samples, we have previously found that p110{beta} is highly expressed in endometrial cancer (EC) cell lines and that PIK3CB mRNA levels increase early in primary tumours correlating with lower survival. Selective inhibition of p110 and p110{beta} led to different effects on cell signalling and cell function, p110 activity being correlated to cell survival in PIK3CA mutant cells and p110{beta} with cell proliferation in PTEN-deficient cells. To understand the mechanisms governing the differential roles of these isoforms, we assessed their sub-cellular localisation. p110 was cytoplasmic whereas p110{beta} was both cytoplasmic and nuclear with increased levels in both compartments in cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry of p110{beta} in clinically annotated patient tumour sections revealed high nuclear/cytoplasmic staining ratio, which correlated significantly with higher grades. Consistently, the presence of high levels of p110{beta} in the nuclei of EC cells, correlated with high levels of its product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) in the nucleus. Using immunofluorescence labelling, we observed both p110{beta} and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the nucleoli of EC cell lines. The production of nucleolar PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was dependent upon p110{beta} activity. EC cells with high levels of nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and p110{beta} showed elevated nucleolar activity as assessed by the increase in 47S pre-rRNA transcriptional levels in a p110{beta}-dependent manner. Altogether, these results present a nucleolar role for the PI3K pathway that may contribute to tumour progression in endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1) represents a major quantitative locus for the genetic regulation of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis. Accumulation of DOG1 in seeds leads to deep dormancy and delayed germination. Here, we report that the conserved B3 DNA binding domains of the transcriptional repressors HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR INDICIBLE GENE2/ VIVIPAROUS-1/ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE1 (HSI2/VAL1) and HSI2-LIKE1/ VIVIPAROUS-1/ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE2 (HSL1/VAL2), which play critical roles in the developmental transition from seed maturation to seedling growth, interact with RY elements in the DOG1 proximal promoter leading to repression of DOG1 transcription during germination and seedling establishment. DOG1 expression is partially de-repressed in hsi2/val1 (hsi2-2) but not in hsl1/val2 (hsl1-1) knockout mutants and is strongly upregulated in a hsi2/val1 hsl1/val2 double mutant, indicating that HSI2/VAL1 and HSL1/VAL2 act redundantly to repress DOG1 expression. HSI2/VAL1 and HSL1/VAL2 form homo- and hetero-dimers in vivo, and dimerization is dependent on the HSI2/VAL1 PHD-like domain. Complementation of hsi2-2 with HSI2/VAL1 harboring a disrupted plant homeodomain (PHD)-like domain results in stronger de-repression of DOG1 expression than the hsi2-2 knockout, indicating that the PHD-like domain plays a critical role in mediating functional interactions between HSI2/VAL1 and HSL1/VAL2. Both HSI2/VAL1 and HSL1/VAL2 interact with components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), including CURLY LEAF and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1), along with LIKE HETERCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1), which are involved in the deposition and expansion of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) marks in repressive chromatin. Thus, HSI2/VAL1 HSL1/VAL2-dependent recruitment of PRC2 leads to silencing of DOG1 through the deposition of H3K27me3.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomes have an intrinsic tendency to segregate into compartments, forming long-distance contacts between loci of similar chromatin states. However, how genome compartmentalization is regulated remains elusive. We analyzed two closely and developmentally related pluripotent cell types: ground-state ESCs that have an open and active chromatin and developmentally advanced ESCs that display a more closed and repressed state. We show that these two ESC types differ in their regulation of genome organization due to their differential dependency on TIP5, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC. We show that TIP5 interacts on ESC chromatin with SNF2H, DNA topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and cohesin. TIP5 associates with sub-domains within the active A compartment that strongly intersect through long-range contacts in ESCs. We found that only ground-state chromatin requires TIP5 to limit the invasion of active domains into repressive compartments. Depletion of TIP5 increased chromatin accessibility particularly at B compartments and decreased their repressive features. Furthermore, TIP5 acts as a barrier for the repressive H3K27me3 spreading, a process that also requires TOP2A activity. Finally, ground-state ESCs require TIP5 for growth, differentiation capacity, and correct expression of developmental genes. Our results revealed the propensity of open and active chromatin domains to invade repressive domains, an action counteracted by chromatin remodeling and the relief of chromatin torsional stress. This effort in controlling open/active chromatin domains is required to establish active and repressed genome partitioning and preserves cell function and identity.",

Mapping these areas is of fundamental importance to neuroscience. A central obstacle to this task is the inaccuracy associated with mapping results from individuals into a common space. The vast individual differences in morphology pose a serious problem for volumetric registration. Surface-based approaches fare substantially better, but have thus far been used only for cortical parcellation. We extend this surface-based approach to include also the subcortical deep gray-matter structures. Using the life-span data from the Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute - Rockland Sample, comprised of data from 590 individuals from 6 to 85 years of age, we generate a functional parcellation of both the cortical and subcortical surfaces. To assess this extended parcellation, we show that our extended functional parcellation provides greater homogeneity of functional connectivity patterns than do arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels. We also show that our subcortical parcels align with known subnuclei. Further, we show that this parcellation is appropriate for use with data from other modalities; we generate cortical and subcortical white/gray contrast measures for this same dataset, and draw on the fact that areal differences are evident in the relation of white/gray contrast to age, to sex, to brain volume, and to interactions of these terms; we show that our extended functional parcellation provides an improved fit to the complexity of the life-span changes in the white/gray contrast data compared to arbitrary parcellations matching in the number and size of parcels.

Hippocampal learning is closely associated with gamma activity, which is amplitude-modulated by the phase of underlying theta activity. Whether such nested activity patterns also underpin skill acquisition in non-hippocampal tasks is unknown. Here we addressed this question by using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over sensorimotor cortex to modulate theta-gamma activity during motor skill acquisition, as an exemplar of a non-hippocampal-dependent task. We demonstrated, and then replicated, a significant improvement in skill acquisition with theta-gamma tACS, which outlasted the stimulation by an hour. Our results suggest that theta-gamma activity may be a common mechanism for learning across the brain and provides a putative novel intervention for optimising functional improvements in response to training or therapy.",

    "abstract": "As insulin sensitivity may help to explain divergences in growth and body composition between native and modern breeds, metabolic responses to glucose infusion were measured using an intra-arterial glucose tolerance test (IAGTT). Iberian (n = 4) and Landrace (n = 5) barrows (47.0 {+/-} 1.2 kg BW), fitted with a permanent carotid artery catheter were injected with glucose (500 mg/kg BW) and blood samples collected at -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min following glucose infusion. Plasma samples were analysed for insulin, glucose, lactate, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, albumin and urea. Insulin sensitivity indices were calculated and analyed. Mean plasma glucose, creatinine and cholesterol concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) in Iberian (14, 68 and 22%, respectively) compared with Landrace pigs during the IAGTT. However, mean plasma insulin, lactate, triglycerides and urea concentrations were greater (P < 0.001) in Iberian (50, 35, 18 and 23%, respectively) than in Landrace pigs. Iberian pigs had larger area under the curve (AUC) of insulin (P < 0.05) and lactate (P < 0.1), and smaller (P < 0.05) AUC for glucose 0-60 min compared with Landrace pigs. Indices for estimating insulin sensitivity in fasting conditions indicated improved {beta}-cell function in Iberian compared with Landrace pigs, but no difference (P > 0.10) in calculated insulin sensitivity index was found after IAGTT between breeds. A time response (P < 0.05) was obtained for insulin, glucose and lactate so that maximum concentration was achieved 10 and 15 min post-infusion for insulin (Iberian and Landrace pigs, respectively), immediately post-infusion for glucose, and 20 min post-infusion for lactate, decreasing thereafter until basal levels. There was no time effect for the rest of metabolites evaluated. In conclusion, growing Iberian pigs challenged with an IAGTT showed changes in biochemical parameters and insulin response that may indicate an early stage of insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "The lignin biosynthetic pathway is highly conserved in angiosperms, yet pathway manipulations give rise to a variety of taxon-specific outcomes. Knockout of lignin-associated 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CLs) in herbaceous species mainly reduces guaiacyl (G) lignin and enhances cell wall saccharification. Here we show that CRISPR-knockout of 4CL1 in Populus tremula x alba preferentially reduced syringyl (S) lignin, with negligible effects on biomass recalcitrance. Concordant with reduced S-lignin was downregulation of ferulate 5-hydroxylases (F5Hs). Lignification was largely sustained by 4CL5, a low-affinity paralog of 4CL1 typically with only minor xylem expression or activity. Levels of caffeate, the preferred substrate of 4CL5, increased in line with significant upregulation of caffeoyl shikimate esterase1. Upregulation of caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase1 and downregulation of F5Hs are consistent with preferential funneling of 4CL5 products toward G-lignin biosynthesis at the expense of S-lignin. Thus, transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to 4CL1-knockout appear to have enabled 4CL5 catalysis at a level sufficient to sustain lignification. Finally, genes involved in sulfur assimilation, the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and various antioxidant systems were upregulated in the mutants, suggesting cascading responses to perturbed thioesterification in lignin biosynthesis.\n\nOne sentence summaryKnockout of lignin-associated 4CL1 in Populus reveals a 4CL5-dependent, caffeate-modulated compensatory pathway for lignification with links to thiol redox balance and sulfur assimilation.",

NRG1 induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and sub-G1 DNA fragmentation, and also reduced the metabolic activity of HER3-negative/HER4-positive cervical (C-33A) and ovarian (COV318) cancer cells.

NRG1 favored 4ICD cleavage and retention in mitochondria in JMa/CYT1-transfected BT549 cells, leading to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production through mitochondrial depolarization. Similarly, the anti-HER4 antibody C6, which binds to a conformational epitope located on aa 575-592 and 605-620 of HER4 domain IV, induced 4ICD cleavage and retention in mitochondria, and mimicked NRG1-mediated effects on PARP cleavage, ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization in cancer cells.

    "abstract": "Modelling behavioural deficits based on structural lesion imaging is a popular approach to map functions in the human brain, and efforts to translationally apply lesion-behaviour modelling to predict post-stroke outcomes are on the rise. The high-dimensional complexity of lesion data, however, evokes challenges in both lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke outcome prediction. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of this complexity by reframing it from the perspective of causal and non-causal dependencies in the data, and by discussing what this complexity implies for different data modelling approaches. By means of theoretical discussion and empirical examination, several common strategies and views are challenged, and future research perspectives are outlined. A main conclusion is that lesion-behaviour inference is subject to a lesion-anatomical bias that cannot be overcome by using multivariate models or any other algorithm that is blind to causality behind relations in the data. This affects the validity of lesion behaviour mapping and might even wrongfully identify paradoxical effects of lesion-induced functional facilitation - but, as this paper argues, only to a minor degree. Thus, multivariate lesion-brain inference appears to be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of the human brain, but only because it takes into account the functional relation between brain areas. The perspective of causality and inter-variable dependence is further used to point out challenges in improving lesion behaviour models. Firstly, the dependencies in the data open up different possible strategies of data reduction, and considering those might improve post-stroke outcome prediction. Secondly, the role of non-topographical causal predictors of post stroke behaviour is discussed. The present article argues that, given these predictors, different strategies are required in the evaluation of model quality in lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke outcome prediction.",

    "abstract": "Investigations into intracellular replication and differentiation of Trypanosoma cruzi within the mammalian host have been restricted by limitations in our ability to detect parasitized cells throughout the course of infection. We have overcome this problem by generating genetically modified parasites that express a bioluminescent/fluorescent fusion protein. By combining in vivo imaging and confocal microscopy, this has enabled us to routinely visualise murine infections at the level of individual host cells. These studies reveal that intracellular parasite replication is an asynchronous process, irrespective of tissue location or disease stage. Furthermore, using TUNEL assays and EdU labelling, we demonstrate that within individual infected cells, replication of both mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear genomes is not co-ordinated within the parasite population, and that replicating amastigotes and non-replicating trypomastigotes can co-exist in the same cell. Finally, we report the presence of distinct non-canonical morphological forms of T. cruzi in the mammalian host. These appear to represent transitional forms in the amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation process. Therefore, the intracellular life-cycle of T. cruzi in vivo is more complex than previously realised, with potential implications for our understanding of disease pathogenesis, immune evasion and drug development. Dissecting the mechanisms involved will be an important experimental challenge.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYChagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is becoming an emerging threat in non-endemic countries and establishing new foci in endemic countries. The treatment available has not changed significantly in over 40 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a greater understanding of parasite biology and disease pathogenesis to identify new therapeutic targets and to maximise the efficient use of existing drugs. We have used genetically modified strains of T. cruzi carrying a bioluminescence/fluorescence dual reporter fusion gene to monitor parasite replication in vivo during both acute and chronic infections in a mouse model. Utilising TUNEL assays for mitochondrial DNA replication and EdU incorporation for total DNA replication, we have found that parasite division within infected cells is asynchronous in all phases of infection. Differentiation also appears to be uncoordinated, with replicating amastigotes co-existing with non-dividing trypomastigotes in the same host cell.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. While previous studies showed that L. donovani reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-{beta} decreased in presence of the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR- and eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours parasite propagation, individual translation programs appear to have opposing roles during L. donovani infection, thereby suggesting their selective targeting as key for therapeutic effects.\n\nAuthor SummaryFine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Genetic bistability controls different phenotypic programs in defined subpopulations of genetically identical bacteria. Conjugative transfer of the integrative and conjugative element ICEclc in Pseudomonas requires development of a transfer competence state in stationary phase, but this state arises only in 3-5% of individual cells. The mechanisms controlling and underlying the bistable switch between non-active and transfer competence cells have long remained enigmatic. Using a variety of genetic tools combined with stochastic modeling, we characterize here the factors and overall network architecture controlling bistable ICEclc activation of transfer competence. Two new key regulators (BisR and BisDC) were uncovered, that link the hierarchical cascade of ICEclc transfer competence activation to in total four regulatory nodes. The final activator complex named BisDC drives a positive feedback on its own transcription, and directly controls the \"late\" ICE promoters for excision and transfer. Stochastic mathematical modeling conceptually explained the arisal and maintenance of bistability by the feedback loop, and demonstrated its importance to guarantee consistent prolonged downstream output in activated cells. A minimized gene set allowing controllable bistable output in a Pseudomonas putida in absence of the ICEclc largely confirmed model predictions. Phylogenetic analyses further showed that the two new ICEclc regulatory factors are widespread among putative ICEs found in Gamma- and Beta- proteobacteria, highlighting the conceptual importance of our findings for the behaviour of this wide family of conjugative elements.\n\nAuthor summaryIntegrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements present in virtually every bacterial species, which can confer adaptive functions to their host, such as antibiotic resistance or xenometabolic pathways. Integrated ICEs maintain by replication along with the genome of their bacterial host, but in order to transfer, the ICE excises and conjugates into a new recipient cell. Single-cell studies on a unique but widely representative ICE model from Pseudomonas (ICEclc) showed that transfer only occurs from a small dedicated subpopulation of cells that arises during stationary phase conditions. This bistable subpopulation differentiation is highly significant for ICE behaviour and fitness, but how it is regulated has remained largely unknown. The present work unveiled the architecture of the ICEclc transfer competence regulation, and showed its widespread occurrence among ICEs of the same family. Stochastic mathematical modeling explained how bistability is generated and maintained, prolonging the capacity of stationary phase cells to complete all stages of ICE activation.",

NHE1 is the primary regulator of pH in the central nervous system. The goal of the current study was to investigate the role of sodium-hydrogen exchanger type 1 (NHE1) in blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity during CSD events and the contributions of this antiporter on xenobiotic uptake. Using immortalized cell lines, pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knockdown of NHE1 mitigated the paracellular uptake of radiolabeled sucrose implicating functional NHE1 in BBB maintenance. In contrast, loss of functional NHE1 in endothelial cells facilitated uptake of the anti-migraine therapeutic, sumatriptan. In female rats, cortical KCl but not aCSF selectively reduced total expression of NHE1 in cortex and PAG with limited impact on trigeminal ganglia or trigeminal nucleus caudalis suggesting in vitro observations may have a significance in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 prior to cortical manipulations enhanced the efficacy of sumatriptan at early time-points but induced facial sensitivity alone. Overall, our results suggest that dysregulation of NHE1 contributes to breaches in BBB integrity, drug penetrance, and the behavioral sensitivity to the antimigraine agent, sumatriptan.",

    "abstract": "For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animals perceptual report. This phenomenon has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. The interpretation of choice-correlated activity is quite ambiguous, but its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings from the middle temporal area during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional neural tra jectories that captured the population-wide fluctuations. We dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code. We found that the neural trajectories strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Surprisingly, we found that a large component of the choice information resides in the subspace orthogonal to the stimulus representation inconsistent with the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas. We hypothesize that this non-corrupting choice-correlated feedback might be related to learning or reinforcing sensory-motor relations in the sensory population.\n\nAuthor summaryIn sensorimotor decision-making, internal representation of sensory stimuli is utilized for the generation of appropriate behavior for the context. Therefore, the correlation between variability in sensory neurons and perceptual decisions is sometimes explained by a causal, feedforward role of sensory noise in behavior. However, this correlation could also originate via feedback from decision-making mechanisms downstream of the sensory representation. This cannot be resolved by analyzing single unit responses, but requires a population level analysis. Area MT contains both sensory and choice information and is known to be the key sensory area for visual motion perception. Thus the decision-making process may be corrupting the sensory representation. However, we find that the sensory stimuli and choice variables are separate at the population level,contradicting the previous interpretations based on single unit recordings. This new insight postulates how neural systems can maintain a mixed representation while allows learning and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Expanded CAG nucleotide repeats are the underlying genetic cause of at least 14 incurable diseases, including Huntingtons disease (HD). The toxicity associated with many CAG repeat expansions is thought to be due to the translation of the CAG repeat to create a polyQ protein, which forms toxic oligomers and aggregates. However, recent studies show that HD CAG repeats undergo a non-canonical form of translation called Repeat-associated non-AUG dependent (RAN) translation. RAN translation of the CAG sense and CUG anti-sense RNAs produces six distinct repeat peptides: polyalanine (polyAla, from both CAG and CUG repeats), polyserine (polySer), polyleucine (polyLeu), polycysteine (polyCys), and polyglutamine (polyGln). The toxic potential of individual CAG-derived RAN polypeptides is not well understood. We developed pure C. elegans protein models for each CAG RAN polypeptide using codon-varied expression constructs that preserve RAN protein sequence but eliminate repetitive CAG/CUG RNA. While all RAN polypeptides formed aggregates, only polyLeu was consistently toxic across multiple cell types. In GABAergic neurons, which exhibit significant neurodegeneration in HD patients, codon-varied (Leu)38, but not (Gln)38, caused substantial neurodegeneration and motility defects. Our studies provide the first in vivo evaluation of CAG-derived RAN polypeptides and suggest that polyQ-independent mechanisms, such as RAN-translated polyLeu peptides, may have a significant pathological role in CAG repeat expansion disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in two mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wildtype oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release less exosomes that share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia to neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.",

    "abstract": "I.AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPAn age-old hypothesis proposes that object motion across the receptor surface organizes sensory maps (Lotze, 19th century). Skin patches learn their relative positions from the order in which they are stimulated during motion events. We test this idea by reversing the local motion within a 6-point apparent motion sequence along the forearm. In the  Scrambled sequence, two middle locations were touched in reversed order (1-2-4-3-5-6, followed by 6-5-3-4-2-1, in a continuous loop). This created a local acceleration, a double U-turn, within an otherwise constant-velocity motion, as if the physical location of skin patches 3 and 4 was surgically swapped. The control condition,  Orderly, proceeded at constant velocity at inter-stimulus onset interval (ISOI) of 120 ms. In the test, our twenty participants reported motion direction between the two middle tactors, presented on their own at 75, 120 or 190-ms ISOI. Results show degraded motion discrimination following exposure to Scrambled pattern: for the 120-ms test stimulus, it was 0.31 d weaker than following Orderly conditioning (p = .007). This is the aftereffect we expected; its maximal expression would be a complete reversal in perceived motion direction between locations 3 and 4 for either motion direction. We propose that the somatosensory system was beginning to  correct reversed local motion to uncurl and remove the U-turns that always occurred on the same part of the receptor surface. Such de-correlation between accelerations and their location on the sensory surface is one possible mechanism for organization of sensory maps.",

The subject of the study was an open-pollinated cultivar (Casoar) and a restored hybrid cultivar (Visby). Three plant protection programmes, two levels of spring nitrogen fertilisation (160 and 220 kg N{middle dot}ha-1), and two different seeding rates for each cultivar (Visby--50 and 70 seeds{middle dot}m-2; Casoar--60 and 80 seeds{middle dot}m-2) were included. The most intensive protection programme comprised three fungicide treatments: first in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage--BBCH 16, second in spring at the stem elongation stage--BBCH 33, and third at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65. One of two less intensive programmes of plant protection included fungicide application in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage--BBCH 16 and at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65, while the second included fungicide application in spring at the stem elongation stage--BBCH 33 and at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65.\n\nThe effectiveness of the protection programmes and nitrogen fertilisation was influenced by the intensity of abiotic stress factors. However, the average yield from the plots protected against pathogens was significantly higher than that from the untreated plots. The increase of nitrogen fertilisation from 160 to 220 kg{middle dot}ha-1 also caused significant increase of average seed yield. The yield of cultivar Visby was higher and less dependent on the seeding rate compared to cultivar Casoar. Cultivars responded similarly to plant protection programmes and the rate of nitrogen fertilisation in spring. Higher yields of Visby cultivar can be attributed to the higher number of seeds per silique and the higher number of siliques per m2.",

    "abstract": "Trans-methylation reactions are intrinsic to cellular metabolism in all living organisms. In land plants, a range of substrate-specific methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell wall components and numerous species-specific metabolites, thereby providing means for growth and acclimation in various terrestrial habitats. Trans-methylation reactions consume vast amounts of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor in several cellular compartments. The inhibitory reaction by-product, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), is continuously removed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH) activity, and in doing so essentially maintains trans-methylation reactions in all living cells. Here we report on the evolutionary conservation and multilevel post-translational control of SAHH in land plants. We find that SAHH forms oligomeric protein complexes in phylogenetically divergent land plants, and provide evidence that the predominant enzyme is a tetramer. By analyzing light-stress-induced adjustments occurring on SAHH in Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patens, we demonstrate that both angiosperms and bryophytes undergo regulatory adjustments in the levels of protein complex formation and post-translational modification of this metabolically central enzyme. Collectively, these data suggest that plant adaptation to terrestrial environments involved evolution of regulatory mechanisms that adjust the trans-methylation machinery in response to environmental cues.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of new nurses clinical competence on career adaptation in order to use the results as basic information for developing education programs to improve their adaptability in clinical practice.\n\nMethodThis study employed a descriptive survey to investigate the clinical competence and the career adaptability of new nurses working in a general hospital. The study subjects were 61 new nurses with less than one year of work experience and data was collected from June, 2018 to July, 2019. Data was analyzed using frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearsons correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis.\n\nResultsOn average, the study subjects have worked for 11.33{+/-}1.51 months. In this study, the average clinical competence of new nurses was 2.21{+/-}0.61, and career adaptability was 3.00{+/-}0.39. The clinical competence of new nurses was positively correlated with career adaptability (r=.453, p<.001). Among the sub-categories of clinical competence, developing professional and legal implementation were found to affect career adaptability (t=2.24, p=.030).\n\nConclusionThe clinical competence of the new nurses was shown to positively affect their career adaptability, and it was confirmed that developing professional and legal implementation in the subcategories of clinical competence affected the career adaptability of the new nurses. Thus, it is necessary to establish a program that provides support for new nurses to enable them to build professional identities that they can be proud of.",

    "abstract": "The study in this paper reveals that the atmospheric contaminants in mainland China is of concentricity in spatial distribution, persistence in temporal distribution and correlation between different parameters. This spatial-temporal variation law plays an important role in improving and addressing the problem with atmospheric environment of given cities and regions by employing focused and pointed measures. In this paper, seven kinds of atmospheric pollution parameters including PM2.5, PM10, AQI, CO, NO2, O3 and SO2 in 370 Chinese cities from 2014 to 2019 are analyzed based on their hourly mass concentration. The spatial-temporal variations of each parameter in each separated year are obtained by using interpolation calculation towards the annual atmospheric pollution parameters. The results show that higher mass concentration (including the highest mass concentration) of PM2.5, AQI, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2 mainly concentrated in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the northeast of mainland China and its neighboring regions and Xinjiang region in the northwest of mainland China. The spatial variation of PM2.5, AQI, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2 experienced similar trend. Higher mass concentration (including the highest mass concentration) of O3 mainly concentrated in Qinghai and Inner Mongolia in the central north of mainland China and Shandong on the right side of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The spatial variation of O3 experienced different trend from that of other parameters. PM2.5, AQI, PM10 indicated increase and decrease, followed by increase and decrease again with time, which was a S-shaped change. Almost the same temporal variation happened to PM2.5, AQI, PM10 and to CO, NO2, SO2, which was opposite to O3. The analysis from the perspective of the annual highest mass concentration of PM2.5, AQI, PM10, NO2 and O3 indicates the atmospheric environment of mainland China had not been authentically improved by 2019. The analysis from the perspective of the annual highest mass concentration of CO and SO2 indicates the atmospheric environment of mainland China had been authentically improved by 2019. What should we do immediately is to strengthen environmental governance and address the source of contamination in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in the northeast of China, Xinjiang region in the northwest of China, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia regions in the central north of China.",

    "abstract": "Adipose is a dynamic endocrine organ that is critical for regulating metabolism and is highly responsive to nutritional environment. Brown adipose tissue is an exciting potential therapeutic target, however there are no systematic studies of gene-by-environment interactions affecting function of this organ. We leveraged a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify transcriptional networks in brown adipose tissue from LG/J and SM/J inbred mice fed high or low fat diets, and correlate these networks with metabolic phenotypes. We identified 8 primary gene network modules associated with variation in obesity and diabetes-related traits. Four modules were enriched for metabolically relevant processes such as immune and cytokine response, cell division, peroxisome functions, and organic molecule metabolic processes. The relative expression of genes in these modules is highly dependent on both genetic background and dietary environment. Genes in the immune/cytkine response and cell division modules are particularly highly expressed in high fat-fed SM/J mice, which show unique brown adipose-dependent remission of diabetes. The interconnectivity of genes in these modules is also heavily dependent on diet and strain, with most genes showing both higher expression and co-expression under the same context. We highlight 4 candidate genes, Col28a1, Cyp26b1, Bmp8b, and Kcnj14, that have distinct expression patterns among strain-by-diet contexts and fall under metabolic QTL previously mapped in an F16 generation of an advanced intercross between these two strains. Each of these genes have some connection to obesity and diabetes-related traits, but have not been studied in brown adipose tissue. In summary, our results provide important insights into the relationship between brown adipose and systemic metabolism by being the first gene-by-environment study of brown adipose transcriptional networks and introducing novel candidate genes for follow-up studies of biological mechanisms of action.\n\nAuthor SummaryResearch on brown adipose tissue is a promising new avenue for understanding and potentially treating metabolic dysfunction. However, we do not know how genetic background interacts with dietary environment to affect the brown adipose transcriptional response, and how this might affect systemic metabolism. Here we report the first investigation of gene-by-environment interactions on brown adipose gene expression networks associating with multiple obesity and diabetes-related traits. We identified 8 primary networks correlated with variation in these traits in mice, including networks enriched for immune and cytokine response, cell division, organic molecule metabolism, and peroxisome genes. Characterizing these networks and their distinct diet-by-strain expression and co-expression patterns is an important step towards understanding how brown adipose tissue responds to an obesogenic diet, how this response affects metabolism, and how this can be modified by genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, shrimp farms, particularly those established in Asia, Mexico and South America suffered from the outbreak of an emergent penaeid shrimp disease known as Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHNPD). The PirA and PirB toxins produced by plasmid pVA1 in Vibrio parahaemolyticus were reported to cause the AHPND pathology. More recent research demonstrated that V. parahaemolyticus is not the only species that can cause AHPND, as other Vibrio species were also found to contain PirAB-containing plasmid. The present study assessed the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of AHPND that transforms genes (pirA and pirB) from AHPND positive V. parahaemolyticus to non-AHPND and non-vibrio species identified as Algoriphagus sp. strain NBP. The HGT of pirA and pirB genes from the AHPND positive V. parahaemolyticus to Algoriphagus sp. strain NBP was found to occur at different temperatures. The conjugation efficiency rate (n{degrees}) of pirAB from V. parahaemolyticus to Algoriphagus sp. strain NBP at 30{degrees}C and 40{degrees}C showed 80-91% efficiency. Shrimp challenged with the pirA and pirB positive Algoriphagus sp. strain NBP also demonstrated typical pathognomonic AHPND lesions during the histopathologic examination.\n\nAuthor summaryAHPND is a significant threat to the shrimp industry leading to high losses. The results demonstrated that the conjugative transfer of the pirA and pirB positive V. parahaemolyticus (donor strain) to a non-Vibrio and non-pathogenic bacterium (recipient strain), successfully transformed the non-pathogenic bacterium into a disease-causing strain with a disease-causing capability similar to the donor strain. Initially, V. parahaemolyticus that express the PirA and PirB toxins which encoded by a conjugative plasmid cause sloughing and degeneration of shrimp hepatopancreatic.",
