    "abstract": "Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, exhibit highly dynamic functions in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Human microglia possess unique features as compared to mouse microglia, but our understanding of human microglial functions is largely limited by an inability to obtain human microglia under homeostatic states. We developed a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based microglial chimeric mouse brain model by transplanting hPSC-derived primitive macrophage precursors into neonatal mouse brains. The engrafted human microglia widely disperse in the brain and replace mouse microglia in corpus callosum at 6 months post-transplantation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the microglial chimeric mouse brains reveals that xenografted hPSC-derived microglia largely retain human microglial identity, as they exhibit signature gene expression patterns consistent with physiological human microglia and recapitulate heterogeneity of adult human microglia. Importantly, the engrafted hPSC-derived microglia exhibit dynamic response to cuprizone-induced demyelination and species-specific transcriptomic differences in the expression of neurological disease-risk genes in microglia. This model will serve as a novel tool to study the role of human microglia in brain development and degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Terminal differentiation is essential for the development and maintenance of tissues in all multi-cellular organisms and is associated with a permanent exit from the cell cycle. Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinates differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Here using adipogenesis as a model system to track differentiation commitment in live cells, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger a simultaneous commitment to differentiate and permanently exit from the cell cycle. We identify a signal integration mechanism whereby the strengths of both mitogen and differentiation stimuli control a molecular competition between cyclin D1 and PPARG-induced expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 which in turn regulates if and when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes. In this way, the differentiation control system is able to couple mitogen and differentiation stimuli to sustain a long-term balance between terminally differentiating cells and maintaining the progenitor cell pool, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIProgenitor cells both commit to terminally differentiate and permanently exit the cell cycle at a precise time in G1 as a result of a competition process that can last over multiple cell cycles.\nC_LIO_LIPositive-feedback driven expression of PPARG and the parallel induction of p21 triggers a rapid commitment to terminally differentiate and then maintains a postmitotic adipocyte state.\nC_LIO_LIOpposing mitogen and adipogenic signals are funneled into a molecular competition in G1 phase that controls if and when cells commit to differentiate, which in turn regulates the number of differentiated cells produced while allowing for the maintenance of sufficient progenitor cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Taste receptor cells use multiple signaling pathways to detect chemicals in potential food items. These cells are functionally grouped into different types: Type I cells act as support cells and have glial-like properties; Type II cells detect bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli; and Type III cells detect sour and salty stimuli. We have identified a new population of taste cells that are broadly tuned to multiple taste stimuli including bitter, sweet, sour and umami. The goal of this study was to characterize these broadly responsive (BR) taste cells. We used an IP3R3-KO mouse (does not release calcium (Ca2+) from Type II cells when stimulated with bitter, sweet or umami stimuli) to characterize the BR cells without any potentially confounding input from Type II cells. Using live cell Ca2+ imaging in isolated taste cells from the IP3R3-KO mouse, we found that BR cells are a subset of Type III cells that respond to sour stimuli but also use a PLC{beta}3 signaling pathway to respond to bitter, sweet and umami stimuli. Unlike Type II cells, individual BR cells are broadly tuned and respond to multiple stimuli across different taste modalities. Live cell imaging in a PLC{beta}3-KO mouse confirmed that BR cells use a PLC{beta}3 signaling pathway to generate Ca2+ signals to bitter, sweet and umami stimuli. Analysis of c-Fos activity in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and short term behavioral assays revealed that BR cells make significant contributions to taste.",

    "abstract": "Environmental metabarcoding is an increasingly popular tool for studying biodiversity in marine and terrestrial biomes. With sequencing costs decreasing, multiple-marker metabarcoding, spanning several branches of the tree of life, is becoming more accessible. However, bioinformatic approaches need to adjust to the diversity of taxonomic compartments targeted as well as to each barcode gene specificities. We built and tested a pipeline based on Illumina read correction with DADA2 allowing analyzing metabarcoding data from prokaryotic (16S) and eukaryotic (18S, COI) life compartments. We implemented the option to cluster Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with swarm v2, a network-based clustering algorithm, and to further curate the ASVs/OTUs based on sequence similarity and co-occurrence rates using a recently developed algorithm, LULU. Finally, flexible taxonomic assignment was implemented via Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Bayesian classifier and BLAST. We validate this pipeline with ribosomal and mitochondrial markers using eukaryotic mock communities and 42 deep-sea sediment samples. The results show that ASVs, reflecting genetic diversity, may not be appropriate for alpha diversity estimation of organisms fitting the biological species concept. The results underline the advantages of clustering and LULU-curation for producing more reliable metazoan biodiversity inventories, and show that LULU is an effective tool for filtering metazoan molecular clusters, although the minimum identity threshold applied to co-occurring OTUs has to be increased for 18S. The comparison of BLAST and the RDP Classifier underlined the potential of the latter to deliver very good assignments, but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to build comprehensive, ecosystem-specific, databases adapted to the studied communities.",

    "abstract": "Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has received increasing attention over the past decade. Many attempts have been made to reduce the cost of bioethanol production by combining the separate steps of the process into a single-step process known as consolidated bioprocessing. This requires identification of organisms that can efficiently decompose lignocellulose to simple sugars and ferment the pentose and hexose sugars liberated to ethanol. There have been many attempts in engineering laboratory strains by adding new genes or modifying genes to expand the capacity of an industrial microorganism. There has been less attention in improving bioethanol-related processes utilizing natural variation existing in the natural ecotypes. In this study, we sought to identify genomic loci contributing to variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation of glucose in the fermenting cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. We identified one major QTL contributing to fermentation of glucose and multiple putative QTLs underlying saccharification. Understanding the natural variation of the major QTL gene would provide new insights in developing industrial microbes for bioethanol production.",

    "abstract": "Deletions within genes coding for subunits of the transcription coactivator SAGA caused strong genome-wide defects in transcription and SAGA-mediated chromatin modifications. In contrast, rapid SAGA depletion produced only modest transcription defects at 13% of protein-coding genes - genes that are generally more sensitive to rapid TFIID depletion. However, transcription of these \"coactivator-redundant\" genes is strongly affected by rapid depletion of both factors, showing the overlapping functions of TFIID and SAGA at this gene set. We suggest that this overlapping function is linked to TBP-DNA recruitment. The remaining 87% of expressed genes that we term \"TFIID-dependent\" are highly sensitive to rapid TFIID depletion and insensitive to rapid SAGA depletion. Genome-wide mapping of SAGA and TFIID found binding of both factors at many genes independent of gene class. DNA analysis suggests that the distinction between the gene classes is due to multiple components rather than any single regulatory factor or promoter sequence motif.",

Optimizing such elegant plant-microbe interactions requires detailed understanding of the chemical element compositions of fresh plant tissues at cellular organelle resolution. However, such analyses remain challenging because conventional methods lack the required spatial resolution, contrast or sensitivity. Using a novel combination of nanoscaleresolution 3D cryogenic synchrotron-light ptychography, holotomography and fluorescence tomography, we show how soil bacteria interact with Arabidopsis thaliana and promote the uptake of various metals. Co-cultivation with Pseudomonas sp. strain T5-6-I alters root anatomy and increases levels of selenium (Se), iron (Fe) and other micronutrients in roots. Our approach highlights the interaction of plants and microbes in bioremediation and biofortification on the subcellular level.",

Density of combinatorial innervation is theorized to determine the number of distinct stimuli that can be represented and distinguished from one another, with sparse innervation thought to optimize the complexity of representations in networks of limited size. How the convergence of combinatorial inputs to principle neurons of associative brain regions is established during development is unknown. Here, we explore the developmental patterning of sparse olfactory inputs to Kenyon cells of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body. By manipulating the ratio between pre- and post-synaptic cells, we find that postsynaptic Kenyon cells set convergence ratio: Kenyon cells produce fixed distributions of dendritic claws while presynaptic processes are plastic. Moreover, we show that sparse odor responses are preserved in mushroom bodies with reduced cellular repertoires, suggesting that developmental specification of convergence ratio allows functional robustness.",

Existing PXR ligands have substantial off-target toxicity. Based on prior work that established microbial (indole) metabolites as PXR ligands, we proposed microbial metabolite mimicry as a novel strategy for drug discovery that allows to exploit previously unexplored parts of chemical space. Here we report functionalized indole-derivatives as first-in-class non-cytotoxic PXR agonists, as a proof-of-concept for microbial metabolite mimicry. The lead compound, FKK6, binds directly to PXR protein in solution, induces PXR specific target gene expression in, cells, human organoids, and mice. FKK6 significantly represses pro-inflammatory cytokine production cells and abrogates inflammation in mice expressing the human PXR gene. The development of FKK6 demonstrates for the first time that microbial metabolite mimicry is a viable strategy for drug discovery and opens the door to mine underexploited regions of chemical space.",

We found that exposure to social play increased recruitment of ORX-A neurons in juvenile rats. Furthermore, central administration of ORX-A decreased social play duration, while central blockade of ORX-1 receptors differentially altered social play duration in juvenile rats with low versus high baseline levels of social play (increasing social play in low baseline social play individuals and decreasing social play in high baseline social play individuals). Together, our results provided the first evidence of a role for the ORX system in the modulation of juvenile social play behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Relatively few genome-wide population studies of field-acquired insecticide resistance have been carried out on agricultural pests. Recently acquired bifenthrin resistance in a population of the navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella), the main insect pest of almond orchards in California, provided an opportunity to examine the short- and long-term effects of heavy insecticide usage in the population genomic landscape of this species. We re-sequenced the genomes of three contemporary A. transitella natural populations differing in bifenthrin resistance status and characterized their population genetics parameters, in the process we detected an exceptionally large selective sweep in all populations. This sweep has virtually no polymorphisms and extends up to 1.3 Mb (spanning 43 genes) in the resistant population. We analyzed the possible causes of this unusually strong population genetic signature, and found genes in the sweep that are associated with DDT and pyrethroid resistance including a cluster of cytochrome P450 coding genes and the gene coding for the small conductance sodium channel \"para\". Moreover, we found that the sequence along the sweep is nearly identical in the genome assembled from a strain founded in 1966, suggesting that the underpinning for insecticide resistance may have been laid a half-century ago when the California Central Valley experienced massive area-wide applications of DDT for pest control. Our findings are consistent with a scenario whereby insecticide resistance in this species evolved as a stacking of selective pressures that started decades ago and that effectively reduced variation in a region of the genome containing several genes associated with resistance to insecticides with a shared target site and mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila blood cells, called hemocytes, are classified into plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions in larvae. We resolved plasmatocytes into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the identification of intermediate states. Further, we discovered rare subsets within crystal cells and lamellocytes that express fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless and receptor breathless, respectively. We demonstrate that these FGF components are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocytes and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIscRNA-seq of Drosophila blood recovers plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes\nC_LIO_LIscRNA-seq identifies different plasmatocyte states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, antimicrobial response, and metabolism\nC_LIO_LIPseudotemporal ordering of single cells identifies crystal cell and lamellocyte intermediate states\nC_LIO_LIscRNA-seq uncovers a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rise of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France has benefited the native community of parasitoids originally associated with oak gall wasps by becoming an additional trophic subsidy and therefore perturbing population dynamics of local parasitoids. However, the successful biological control of this pest has then led to significant decreases in its population densities. Here we investigate how the invasion of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France and its subsequent control by the exotic parasitoid Torymus sinensis has impacted the local community of native parasitoids.\n\nWe explored 5 years of native community dynamics within 26 locations during the rise and fall of the invasive pest. In an attempt to understand how mechanisms such as local extinction or competition come into play, we analyzed how the patterns of co-occurrence between the different native parasitoid species changed through time.\n\nOur results demonstrate that native parasitoid communities experienced increased competition as the D. kuriphilus levels of infestation decreased. During the last year of the survey, two alternative patterns were observed depending on the sampled location: either native parasitoid communities were represented by an extremely limited number of species occurring at low densities, in some cases no native parasitoid species at all, or they were dominated by one main parasitoid: Mesopolobus sericeus. These two patterns seemed to correlate with the habitat type, M. sericeus being more abundant in semi-natural habitats compared to agricultural lands, the former known to be natural reservoirs for native parasitoids. These results highlight how the \"boom-and-bust\" dynamics of an invasive pest followed by successful biological control can deeply alter the structure of native communities of natural enemies.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Zoology https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.zool.100004",

    "abstract": "We describe an adaptation of conventional ELISA methods to an ELISA-Array format using non-contact Piezo printing of up to 30 spots of purified recombinant viral fusion proteins, vaccine and virus on 96 well high-protein binding plates. Antigens were printed in 1 nanoliter volumes of protein stabilizing buffer using as little as 0.25 nanograms of protein, 2000-fold less than conventional ELISA. The performance of the ELISA-Array was demonstrated by serially diluting n=8 human post-flu vaccination plasma samples starting at a 1/1000 dilution and measuring binding to the array of Influenza antigens. Plasma polyclonal antibody levels were detected using a cocktail of biotinylated anti-human kappa and lambda light chain antibodies, followed by a Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the dose-dependent signal was developed with a precipitable TMB substrate. Intra- and inter-assay precision of absorbance units among the eight donor samples showed mean CVs of 4.8% and 10.8%, respectively. The plasma could be differentiated by donor and antigen with titer sensitivities ranging from 1 x 103 to 4 x 106, IC50 values from 1 x 104 to 9 x 106, and monoclonal antibody sensitivities in the ng/mL range. Equivalent sensitivities of ELISA versus ELISA-Array, compared using plasma and an H1N1 HA trimer, were achieved on the ELISA-Array printed at 0.25ng per 200um spot and 1000ng per ELISA 96-well. Vacuum-sealed array plates were shown to be stable when stored for at least 2 days at ambient temperature and up to 1 month at 4-8{degrees}C. By the use of any set of printed antigens and analyte matrices the methods of this multiplexed ELISA-Array format can be broadly applied in translational research.",

We investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation of D1+ (direct) and A2A+ (indirect) neurons in the ventrolateral striatum in head-fixed mice on a fixed time reinforcement schedule. Direct pathway stimulation initiates licking, whereas indirect pathway stimulation suppresses licking and results in rebound licking after stimulation. Moreover, direct and indirect pathways also play distinct roles in timing. Direct pathway stimulation produced a resetting of the internal timing process, whereas indirect pathway stimulation transiently paused timing, and proportionally delayed the next bout of licking. Our results provide evidence for the continuous and opposing contributions of the direct and indirect pathways in the production and timing of reward-guided behavior.",

In an evolutionary twist, toxins betray the identity of their bearers when herbivores co-opt them as cues for host-plant finding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We focused on Scaptomyza flava, an herbivorous drosophilid specialized on isothiocyanate (ITC)-producing (Brassicaceae) plants, and identified Or67b paralogs that were triplicated as mustard-specific herbivory evolved. Using heterologous systems for the expression of olfactory receptors, we found that S. flava Or67bs, but not homologs from microbe-feeding relatives, responded selectively to ITCs, each paralog detecting different ITC subsets. Consistent with this, S. flava was attracted to ITCs, as was Drosophila melanogaster expressing S. flava Or67b3 in the homologous Or67b olfactory circuit. Thus, our results show that plant toxins were likely co-opted as olfactory attractants through gene duplication and functional specialization (neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization) in drosophilid flies.",

    "abstract": "Arabic digits (1-9) are everywhere in our daily lives. These symbols convey various semantic information, and numerate adults can easily extract from them several numerical features such as magnitude and parity. Nonetheless, since most studies used active processing tasks to assess these properties, it remains unclear whether and to what degree the access to magnitude and especially to parity is automatic. Here we investigated with EEG whether spontaneous processing of magnitude or parity can be recorded in a frequency-tagging approach, in which participants are passively stimulated by fast visual sequences of Arabic digits. We assessed automatic magnitude processing by presenting a stream of frequent small digit numbers mixed with deviant large digits (and the reverse) with a sinusoidal contrast modulation at the frequency of 10 Hz. We used the same paradigm to investigate numerical parity processing, contrasting odd digits to even digits. We found significant brain responses at the frequency of the fluctuating change and its harmonics, recorded on electrodes encompassing right occipitoparietal regions, in both conditions. Our findings indicate that both magnitude and parity are spontaneously and unintentionally extracted from Arabic digits, which supports that they are salient semantic features deeply associated to digit symbols in long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "Coding of odorous stimuli has been mostly studied using single isolated stimuli. However, a single sniff of air in a natural environment is likely to introduce airborne chemicals emitted by multiple objects into the nose. The olfactory system is therefore faced with the task of segmenting odor mixtures to identify objects in the presence of rich and often unpredictable backgrounds. The piriform cortex is thought to be the site of object recognition and scene segmentation, yet the nature of its responses to odorant mixtures is largely unknown. In this study, we asked two related questions. 1) How are mixtures represented in the piriform cortex? And 2) Can the identity of individual mixture components be read out from mixture representations in the piriform cortex? To answer these questions, we recorded single unit activity in the piriform cortex of naive mice while sequentially presenting single odorants and their mixtures. We find that a normalization model explains mixture responses well, both at the single neuron, and at the population level. Additionally, we show that mixture components can be identified from piriform cortical activity by pooling responses of a small population of neurons - in many cases a single neuron is sufficient. These results indicate that piriform cortical representations are well suited to perform figure-background segmentation without the need for learning.",

The observed enhanced denaturing ability of urea/KI mixture can be explained by direct interactions of urea/K+/water towards protein (electrostatic and vdW interactions from urea and electrostatic interactions from K+ and water) and indirect influence of KI on the strengthened interaction of urea towards protein backbone and side-chain. The latter indirect influence is fulfilled through the weakening of hydrogen bonding network among urea and water by the appearance of K+-water and I--urea interactions. As a result, the denaturing ability enhancement of urea and KI mixed solution is induced by the collaborative behavior of urea and KI salt.",

We studied HOX TF DNA-binding and regulatory activity during an in vitro motor neuron differentiation system that recapitulates embryonic development. We find diversity in the genomic binding profiles of different HOX TFs, even among the posterior group paralogs that share similar DNA binding domains. These differences in genomic binding are explained by differing abilities to bind to previously inaccessible sites. For example, the posterior group HOXC9 has a greater ability to bind occluded sites than the posterior HOXC10, producing different binding patterns and driving differential gene expression programs. From these results, we propose that the differential abilities of posterior HOX TFs to bind to previously inaccessible chromatin drive patterning diversification.",

We study the polymer model of the chromosome, in which there are neither blocks of homogeneous elements nor homogeneous interactions and all the interaction energies are different.

    "abstract": "Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a model protein for light-driven proton pumps, where the vectorial active proton transport results in light-energy conversion. To clarify the microscopic mechanism of primary proton transfer from retinal Schiff base (SB) to Asp85 in BR, herein we performed quantum-mechanical metadynamics simulations of the whole BR system ([~]3800 atoms). The simulations showed a novel proton transfer mechanism, viz. hydroxide ion mechanism, in which the deprotonation of specific internal water (Wat452) yields the protonation of Asp85 via Thr89, after which the resulting hydroxide ion accepts the remaining proton from retinal SB. Furthermore, systematic investigations adopting four sequential snapshots obtained by the time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography revealed that proton transfer took 2-5.25 s on the photocycle. The presence of Wat401, which is the main difference between snapshots at 2 and 5.25 s, is found to be essential in assisting the primary proton transfer.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEBacteriorhodopsin (BR), the benchmark of light-driven proton pumps, has attracted much attention from diverse areas in terms of energy conversion. Despite the significant experimental and theoretical efforts, the microscopic mechanism of the proton transfers in BR is not completely unveiled. In this study, quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations of whole BR system were performed to elucidate the primary proton transfer in the L intermediate state with the latest snapshots obtained from X-ray free electron laser. As a result, it is found that the hydroxide ion originating from the specific internal water, which appears at the active site only in the L state, acts as a carrier for the primary proton transfer, demonstrating the importance of hydroxide ions in proton pumps.",

    "abstract": "Organelle specific protein identification is essential for understanding how cell functions on a subcellular level. Here, we report a light mediated proximal labeling (LIMPLA) strategy for organelle specific protein profiling in living cells. In this strategy, various commercial mitochondria-localized fluorescent trackers, such as Mitoview 405 and Rhodamine 123, can activate 2-Propynylamine (PA) to label proximal proteins in mitochondria under illumination. PA tagged proteins are subsequently derivatized via click chemistry with azido fluorescent dye for imaging or with azido biotin for further enrichment and mass-spec identification. This strategy can be generalized to other organelles specific protein labeling. For example, proteins in nucleus are labeled by utilizing the commercial nucleus tracker DRAQ5. As compared with other chemical strategies for subcellular protein labeling, there are several advantages for this LIMPLA strategy. First, this approach allows minimal interference to the cells status by avoiding exogenous gene tansduction and some special treatment such as hydrogen peroxide or serum starvation. Second, all reagents used in this strategy are commercially available without additional synthesis work. Further, this strategy holds the potential for analyzing proximal proteins of specific macromolecules that can be tagged with fluorescent dye by metabolic labeling strategy.",

It was also observed that cationic nanoparticles compromised the integrity of the plasma membrane at higher concentrations. Cationic nanoparticle challenge also caused changes in physicochemical characteristics of plasma membrane. Higher concentration of cationic nanoparticles caused an irreversible change in the surface charge density of cells. However, anionic gold nanoparticles did not show any such effect. It was observed that the ROS-mediated oxidative stress was the mechanism of cationic gold nanoparticle-mediated cytotoxic effect. Mitochondrial depolarization was observed in both anionic and cationic nanoparticle challenge. Therefore, the role of mitochondrial ROS in nanoparticle-mediated cytotoxicity is questionable. Finally, a generalized model involving modulation of intracellular Ca2+ can potentially provide an explanation for the observed pluralistic response of the cells towards nanoparticle challenge.",

    "abstract": "The first winged insects underwent profound morphological and functional transformations leading to the most successful animal radiations in the history of earth. Despite this, we still have a very incomplete picture of the changes in their genomes that underlay this radiation. Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) are one of the extant sister groups of all other winged insects and therefore are at a key phylogenetic position to understand this radiation. Here, we describe the genome of the cosmopolitan mayfly Cloeon dipterum and study its expression along development and in specific organs. We discover an expansion of odorant-binding proteins, some expressed specifically in the breathing gills of aquatic nymphs, suggesting a novel sensory role for gills. In contrast, as flying adults, mayflies make use of an enlarged set of opsins and utilise these visual genes in a sexually dimorphic manner, with some opsins expressed only in males. Finally, to illuminate the origin of wings, we identify a core set of deeply conserved wing-specific genes at the root of the pterygote insects. Globally, this is the first comprehensive study of the structure and expression of the genome of a paleopteran insect and shows how its genome has kept a record of its functional adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Predicting compound-protein affinity is beneficial for accelerating drug discovery. Doing so without the often-unavailable structure data is gaining interest. However, recent progress in structure-free affinity prediction, made by machine learning, focuses on accuracy but leaves much to be desired for interpretability. Defining inter-molecular contacts underlying affinities as a vehicle for interpretability, our large-scale interpretability assessment finds previously-used attention mechanisms inadequate. We thus formulate a hierarchical multi-objective learning problem whose predicted contacts form the basis for predicted affinities. And we solve the problem by embedding protein sequences (by hierarchical recurrent neural networks) and compound graphs (by graph neural networks) with joint attentions between protein residues and compound atoms. We further introduce three methodological advances to enhance interpretability: (1) structure-aware regularization of attentions using protein sequence-predicted solvent exposure and residue-residue contact maps; (2) supervision of attentions using known inter-molecular contacts in training data; and (3) an intrinsically explainable architecture where atomic-level contacts or \"relations\" lead to molecular-level affinity prediction. The first two and all three advances result in DeepAffinity+ and DeepRelations, respectively. Our methods show generalizability in affinity prediction for molecules that are new and dissimilar to training examples. Moreover, they show superior interpretability compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods: with similar or better affinity prediction, they boost the AUPRC of contact prediction by around 33, 35, 10, and 9-fold for the default test, new-compound, new-protein, and both-new sets, respectively. We further demonstrate their potential utilities in contact-assisted docking, structure-free binding site prediction, and structure-activity relationship studies without docking. Our study represents the first model development and systematic model assessment dedicated to interpretable machine learning for structure-free compound-protein affinity prediction.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence variation that are inherited through cell division (Holliday, 2006). In addition to a fundamental role in cell differentiation, some epigenetic changes can also be transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis (Heard and Martienssen, 2014). Epigenetic alterations (\"epimutations\") could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift (Burggren, 2016). However, this suggestion is controversial, partly because unlike classical mutations involving DNA sequence changes, key parameters such as the rate at which epimutations arise and their persistence are unknown. Here, we perform the first genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan organism. We use experimental evolution to characterise the rate, spectrum and stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode C. elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate [~]25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have short half-lives of 2-3 generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations last at least 10 generations. Epimutations thus may contribute to evolutionary processes over a short timescale but are unlikely to bring about long-term divergence without further DNA sequence changes.",

    "abstract": "Our main goal was to determine the influence of white matter integrity on the dynamic coupling between brain regions and the individual variability of cognitive performance in older adults. EEG was recorded while participants performed a task specifically designed to engage working memory and inhibitory processes, and the associations among functional activity, structural integrity, and cognitive performance were assessed. We found that the association between white matter microstructural integrity and cognitive functioning with aging is mediated by time-varying alpha and gamma phase-locking value (PLV). Specifically, older individuals with better preservation of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus showed greater task-related modulations of alpha and gamma long-range PLV between the inferior frontal gyrus and occipital lobe, lower local phase-amplitude coupling in occipital lobes, and better cognitive control performance. Our results help delineate the role of individual variability of white matter microstructure in dynamic synchrony and cognitive performance during normal aging, and show that even small reductions in white matter integrity can lead to altered communications between brain regions, which in turn can result in reduced efficiency of cognitive functioning.\n\nSignificance statementCognitive aging is associated with large individual differences, as some individuals maintain cognitive performance similar to that of young adults while others are significantly impaired. We hypothesized that individual differences in white matter integrity would influence the functional synchrony between frontal and posterior brain regions, and cognitive performance in older adults. We found that the association between reduced tract integrity and worse cognitive performance in older adults was mediated by task-related modulations of coupling synchrony in the alpha and gamma bands. Results offer a mechanistic explanation for the neural basis of the variability of cognitive performance in older adults who do not have any clinically diagnosable neuropathology, and for the association between structural network integrity and cognition in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Language impairments caused by stroke (post-stroke aphasia) and neurodegeneration (primary progressive aphasia) have overlapping symptomatology, nomenclature and are classically divided into categorical subtypes. Surprisingly, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and post-stroke aphasia (PSA) have rarely been directly compared in detail. Rather previous studies have compared certain subtypes (e.g., semantic variants) or have focussed on a specific cognitive/linguistic task (e.g., reading). This study assessed a large range of linguistic and cognitive tasks across the full spectra of PSA and PPA. We applied varimax-rotated principal component analysis to explore the underlying structure of the variance in the assessment scores. Similar phonological, semantic and fluency-related components were found for PSA and PPA. A combined principal component analysis across the two aetiologies revealed graded intragroup and intergroup variations on all four extracted components. Classification analysis was employed to test, formally, whether there were any categorical boundaries for any subtypes of PPA or PSA. Semantic dementia proved to form a true diagnostic category (i.e., within group homogeneity and distinct between group differences), whereas there was considerable overlap and graded variations within and between other subtypes of PPA and PSA. These results suggest that (a) a multi-dimensional rather than categorical classification system may be a better conceptualisation of aphasia from both causes, and (b) despite the very different types of pathology, these broad classes of aphasia have considerable features in common.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged lag time can be induced by starvation contributing to the antibiotic tolerance of bacteria. We analyze the optimal lag time to survive and grow the iterative and stochastic application of antibiotics. A simple model shows that the optimal lag time can exhibit a discontinuous transition when the severeness of the antibiotic application, such as the probability to be exposed the antibiotic, the death rate under the exposure, and the duration of the exposure, is increased. This suggests the possibility of reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a continuous transition. We then present a generic framework to investigate the optimal lag time distribution for total population fitness for a given distribution of the antibiotic application duration. The obtained optimal distributions have multiple peaks for a wide range of the antibiotic application duration distributions, including the case where the latter is monotonically decreasing. The analysis supports the advantage in evolving multiple, possibly discrete phenotypes in lag time for bacterial long-term fitness.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria grow exponentially consuming nutrients, and then starve until the next nutrient is added. During the starvation, the cells enter dormancy and the cells become tolerant not only to starvation but also to other stressors. When nutrients are given to the starved cells, it takes some time before the cells fully \"wake-up\" and proliferate again. At first sight, it appears that the shorter this lag time the better for the bacteria. However, if the environment may contain another deadly stressor such as antibiotics, it may be better to \"over-sleep\" until the stressor is gone. Thus, they need to evolve to optimize their waking up strategy in the fluctuating environment. Here we have developed a theory for the optimal strategy for the repeated grow-and-starvation cycles with a fluctuating application of antibiotics. The optimal lag time exhibits a steep transition from immediate wake-up to over-sleep when the severeness of the antibiotics exceeds the threshold. The proposed general framework provides a way to predict the optimal distribution of lag time for various environmental fluctuation, and it may open for possible applications in administrating drug usage for interventions of pathogenic bacteria as well as cancer therapies where drug tolerance of dormant cells are observed.",

Such effects have, however, scarcely been demonstrated quantitatively, because few laboratory biomechanical measures apply outdoors. Walking can nevertheless be quantified by other means. In particular, the foots trajectory in space can be reconstructed from foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs), to yield measures of stride and associated variabilities. But it remains unknown whether such measures are related to metabolic energy expenditure. We therefore quantified the effect of five different outdoor terrains on foot motion (from IMUs) and net metabolic rate (from oxygen consumption) in healthy adults (N = 10; walking at 1.25 m/s). Energy expenditure increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the order Sidewalk, Dirt, Gravel, Grass, and Woodchips, with Woodchips about 27% costlier than Sidewalk. Terrain type also affected measures, particularly stride variability and virtual foot clearance (swing foots lowest height above consecutive footfalls). In combination, such measures can also roughly predict metabolic cost (adjusted R2 = 0.52, partial least squares regression), and even discriminate between terrain types (10% reclassification error). Body-worn sensors can characterize how uneven terrain affects gait, gait variability, and metabolic cost in the real world.",

    "abstract": "Tracking animal movements over time can fundamentally determine the success of disease control interventions throughout targeting farms that are tightly connected. In commercial pig production, animals are transported between farms based on growth stages, thus it generates time-varying contact networks that will influence the dynamics of disease spread. Still, risk-based surveillance strategies are mostly based on a static network. In this study, we reconstructed the static and temporal pig networks of one Brazilian state from 2017 to 2018, comprising 351,519 movements and 48 million transported pigs. The static networks failed to capture time-respecting movement pathways. Therefore, we propose a time-dependent network susceptible-infected (SI) model to simulate the temporal spread of an epidemic over the pig network globally through the temporal movement of animals among farms, and locally with a stochastic compartmental model in each farm, configured to calculate the minimum number of target farms needed to achieve effective disease control. In addition, we propagated disease on the pig temporal network to calculate the cumulative contacts as a proxy of epidemic sizes and evaluated the impact of network-based disease control strategies. The results show that targeting the first 1,000 farms ranked by degree would be sufficient and feasible to diminish disease spread considerably. Our finding also suggested that assuming a worst-case scenario in which every movement transmit disease, pursuing farms by degree would limit the transmission to up to 29 farms over the two years period, which is lower than the number of infected farms for random surveillance, with epidemic sizes of 2,593 farms. The top 1,000 farms could benefit from enhanced biosecurity plans and improved surveillance, which constitute important next steps in strategizing targeted disease control interventions. Overall, the proposed modeling framework provides a parsimonious solution for targeted disease surveillance when temporal movement data is available.",

We propose a novel coefficient of determination which is dimensionless, has an intuitive and simple definition in terms of variance explained, is additive for several random effects and reduces to the adjusted coefficient of determination in the linear model. To this end, we prove a full decomposition of the sum of squares of the independent variable into the explained and residual variance. Based on the restricted maximum likelihood equations, we introduce a novel measure for the explained variation which we allocate specifically to the contribution of the fixed and the random covariates of the model. We illustrate on two genomic datasets that the novel coefficient of determination can be applied as an improved estimator of the heritability of complex traits. Exemplarily, we allocate the explained variation to the five chromosomes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and determine the contribution of each chromosome as well as cross-correlations between the chromosomes to the trait heritability.",

    "abstract": "As technical developments in omics and biomedical imaging drive the increase in quality, modality, and throughput of data generation in life sciences, the need for information systems capable of integrative, long-term storage and management of these heterogeneous digital assets is also increasing. Here, we propose an approach based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design, to allow the integrated management and analysis of multi-omics and biomedical imaging data. The proposed architecture introduces an interoperable image management system, the OMERO server, into the backend of qPortal, a FAIR-compliant web-based platform for omics data management. The implementation of an integrated metadata model, the development of software components to enable the communication with the OMERO server, and an extension to the data management operations of established software, allows for FAIR management of heterogeneous omics and biomedical imaging data within an integrated system, which facilitates metadata queries from web-based scientific applications. The applicability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated in two prototypical use cases, a plant biology study using confocal scanning microscopy, and a clinical study on hepatocellular carcinoma, with data from a variety of medical imaging and omics modalities. We anticipate that FAIR data management systems for multi-modal data repositories will play a pivotal role in data-driven research, as the joint analysis of omics and imaging data becomes not only desirable but necessary to derive novel insights into biological processes. In particular for powerful machine learning applications where the availability of large datasets with high quality phenotypic annotations is a requirement.",

VNS is used in treatment-resistant epilepsy, and is increasingly being explored for other disorders, such as depression, and as a cognitive enhancer. However, the promise of VNS is only partially fulfilled due to a lack of mechanistic understanding of the transfer function between stimulation parameters and neuromodulatory response, together with a lack of biosensors for assaying stimulation efficacy in real time. We here develop an approach to VNS in head-fixed mice on a treadmill and show that pupil dilation is a reliable and convenient biosensor for VNS-evoked cortical neuromodulation. In an  optimal zone of stimulation parameters, current leakage and off-target effects are minimized and the extent of pupil dilation tracks VNS-evoked basal-forebrain cholinergic axon activity in neocortex. Thus, pupil dilation is a sensitive readout of the moment-by-moment, titratable effects of VNS on brain state.",

    "abstract": "AbstractArenaviral infections often resulting in lethal Hemorrhagic Fevers (HF) affect primarily African and South American regions. To date, there is no FDA-approved licensed vaccine against arenaviruses and treatments have been limited to supportive therapies. Hence, the study was employed to design a highly immunogenic heterosubtypic vaccine candidate against Arenaviridae family. The whole proteomes of Lassa virus (LASV), Lymphocytic Chorio Meningitis Virus (LCMV), Lujo virus and Guanarito virus were retrieved from NCBI database and assessed to determine the most antigenic viral proteins. Only the conserved sequences were used for T cell and B cell epitope prediction to ensure protective response against a wide range of viral strains. For each virus, nucleoproteins were identified as most antigenic which generated a plethora of antigenic epitopes. The proposed epitopes were highly conserved (up to 100%) and showed high cumulative population coverage. Moreover, results revealed that among the top epitopes, T cell epitope GWPYIGSRS were conserved in Argentine mammarenavirus (Junin virus) and Brazilian mammarenavirus (Sabia virus), while B cell epitope NLLYKICLSG were conserved in Bolivian mammarenavirus (Machupo virus) and Brazilian mammarenavirus (Sabia virus), indicating the possibility of final vaccine constructs to confer broad range immunity in the host. A total 3 constructs were designed by the combination of top epitopes from each protein along with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Different physicochemical properties revealed the superiority of construct V1 in terms of safety and efficacy. Docking analysis of the refined vaccine structure with different MHC molecules and human immune receptors were also biologically significant. The vaccine receptor complex (V1-TLR3) showed minimal deformability at molecular level. Moreover, construct V1 was compatible for insertion into pET28a(+) vector and heterologous cloning in E. coli srain K12. However, the results were based on different sequence analysis and various immune databases. Further wet lab based studies using model animals are highly recommended for the experimental validation of the designed vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "Several new technologies have recently emerged promising new MEG systems in which the sensors can be placed close to the scalp. One such technology, Optically Pumped Magnetometry MEG (OP-MEG) allows for a scalp mounted flexible system that provides field measurements within mm of the scalp surface. A question that arises in developing on-scalp systems, such as OP-MEG scanners, is: how many sensors are necessary to achieve adequate performance/spatial discrimination? There are many factors to consider in answering this question such as the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the locations and depths of the sources of interest, the density of spatial sampling, sensor gain errors (due to interference, subject movement, cross-talk, etc.) and, of course, the desired spatial discrimination. In this paper, we provide simulations which show the impact these factors have on designing sensor arrays for wearable MEG. While OP-MEG has the potential to provide high information content at dense spatial samplings, we find that adequate spatial discrimination of sources (<1cm) can be achieved with relatively few sensors (<100) at coarse spatial samplings (~30mm) at high SNR. Comparable discrimination for traditional cryogenic systems require far more channels by these same metrics. Finally we show that sensor gain errors have the greatest impact on discrimination between deep sources at high SNR.",

The identification of this MPN-associated driver mutation -currently based on molecular assays- is represented as a major diagnostic criterion for essential thrombocythaemia (ET), pre-fibrotic myelofibrosis and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in the updated World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification. In the present study, we validated by immunohistochemistry the diagnostic usefulness of the monoclonal CAL2 antibody. Cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) have been also investigated to assess the specificity of CAL2 antibody. For this purpose, the result of the CAL2 immunostaining was compared with the result of molecular assays. Additionally, we investigated by double staining whether expression of mutated CALR can also be demonstrated on cells of the erythroid and myeloid lineage. We confirmed the usefulness of the CAL2 monoclonal antibody in successfully detecting mutant CALR in bone marrow biopsies. We showed that the immune-reactivity of CAL2 was absolutely restricted to the presence of CALR mutations, which were seen only in ET and MDS/MPN biopsies, but not in AML biopsies (14/14). There was 100% concordance in biopsy specimens with the concomitant molecular results. We applied double staining technique and confirmed that a subpopulation of granulopoietic and erythropoietic cells express mutated CALR as demonstrated with the CAL2 antibody in cases of MPNs. This supports the suggestion that the CALR mutations occur in a multipotent progenitor capable of generating both myeloid and erythroid progeny with preferential expansion of megakaryocytic cell lineage as a result of CALR mutation in an immature hematopoietic stem cell.",

Antibody-drug conjugates are emerging as an efficient option, which allow specific delivery of drugs into tumors. We and others have dissected the abnormally glycosylated tandem repeat region of MUC1 glycoprotein as three site-specific glycosylated neoantigen peptide motifs (PDTR, GSTA, GVTS) for monoclonal antibody binding.\n\nMethodsInternalization of monoclonal antibodies was studied by immunofluorescence staining and colocalization with lysosomal markers in live cells. Antibody positivity in tumor and peritumoral tissue samples were studied by immunohistochemistry. The efficacy of anti-MUC1 ADCs were evaluated with various cancer cell lines and mouse tumor xenograft model.\n\nResultsWe describe an anti-MUC1 ADC by conjugating GSTA neoantigen-specific 16A with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). 16A-MMAE showed potent antitumoral efficacy with IC50 ranging from 0.2 to 49.4 nM toward multiple types of cancer cells. In vivo, 16A-MMAE showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in mouse xenograft of NCI-H838 NSCLC cell line, with minimum effective dose at 1 mg/kg. At the dose of 3 mg/kg, 16A-MMAE did not cause significant toxicity in a transgenic mouse expressing human MUC1.\n\nConclusionsThe high antitumoral efficacy of 16A-MMAE suggest that aberrant glycosylated MUC1 neoantigen is a target with high positivity in multiple cancer types for ADC development.

    "abstract": "Modification of host hormone biology is a common strategy used by plant pathogens to promote disease. For example, the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae strain PtoDC3000 produces the plant hormone auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid, or IAA) to promote PtoDC3000 growth in plant tissue. Previous studies suggest that auxin may promote PtoDC3000 pathogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including both suppression of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated host defenses and via an unknown mechanism that appears to be independent of SA. To test if host auxin signaling is important during pathogenesis, we took advantage of Arabidopsis thaliana lines impaired in either auxin signaling or perception. We found that disruption of auxin signaling in plants expressing an inducible dominant axr2-1 mutation resulted in decreased bacterial growth, demonstrating that host auxin signaling is required for normal susceptibility to PtoDC3000, and this phenotype was dependent on SA-mediated defenses. However, despite exhibiting decreased auxin perception, tir1 afb1 afb4 afb5 quadruple mutant plants lacking four of the six known auxin co-receptors supported increased levels of bacterial growth. This mutant also exhibited elevated IAA levels, suggesting that the increased IAA in these plants may promote PtoDC3000 growth independent of host auxin signaling, perhaps through a direct effect on the pathogen. In support of this, we found that IAA directly impacted the pathogen, by modulating expression of bacterial virulence genes, both in liquid culture and in planta. Thus, in addition to suppressing host defenses, IAA acts as a microbial signaling molecule that regulates bacterial virulence gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Gastric Cancer (GC) is one of the most serious cancers with high incidence and mortality all over the world. Chemotherapy hadnt led to desirable effect and targeted therapy brings about a new stage to cancer treatment. Ramucirumab is the first FDA-approved therapy for advanced gastric cancer. It is well known that gold nanorod, a nontoxic biocompatible nanomaterial, is an especially promising candidate for cancer theranostic. In this study, Ramucirumab (Ab) were first modified by gold nanoparticles to enhance uptake efficiency. The simple Nano-delivery system had taken perfect aggregation effect in vivo even better than 5-fold Ab treatment. Gold nanomaterials, especially gold nanorod (AuNR), could induce direct cytotoxic effect to cancer cell in the presence of Ab, while Ab or gold nanoparticle themselves couldnt lead to such direct killing effect even at an extremely high concentration. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed this direct cytotoxicity derived predominantly from Ab-mediated phagocytose, and the high affinity receptor for Fc gamma CD64 showed differential up-regulation only in gastric cancer cell treated by these nanodrugs compared with Ab, especially for AuNR group. This was the first time to discover that nanoparticle could induce regulation of immune related pathways and Fc{gamma} receptor in the target cancer cell. Simplified and powerful designs of smart nanoparticles are highly desired for clinical. The dramatic enhancement of Ab accumulation with simple composition, combined with direct cytotoxic effect specific to cancer cells brought perfect therapeutic effects in vivo than Ab, which would promote further clinical application of gold nanorod in the diagnosis and therapeutics of gastric cancer.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/888537v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (85K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a9c9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a04e82org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@824fb1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e16c2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

NEMo explicitly models three fundamental processes of niche evolution - adaptation, speciation, and dispersal - applying a reversible jump algorithm to infer occurrences of these processes on a phylogeny.

Collectively invading breast cancer cells co-express adherens junctions and connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junctions in vitro and in patient samples, yet whether gap junctions contribute to collective invasion remains unclear. We here show that Cx43 is required for chemical coupling between collectively invading breast cancer cells and, by its hemichannel function, adenosine nucleotide release into the extracellular space. Using molecular interference and rescue strategies in vitro and in orthotopic mammary tumors in vivo, Cx43-dependent adenosine nucleotide release was identified as essential mediator engaging the nucleoside receptor ADORA1, to induce leader cell activity and collective migration. In clinical samples joint-upregulation of Cx43 and ADORA1 predicts decreased relapse-free survival. This identifies autocrine nucleotide signaling, through a Cx43/ADORA1 axis, as critical pathway in leader cell function and collective cancer cell invasion.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "There has been much focus on the mechanisms of temporal integration, but little on how circuits learn to integrate. In the adult oculomotor system, where a neural integrator maintains fixations, changes in integration dynamics can be driven by visual error signals. However, we show through dark-rearing experiments that visual inputs are not necessary for initial integrator development. We therefore propose a vision-independent learning mechanism whereby a recurrent network learns to integrate via a  teaching signal formed by low-pass filtered feedback of its population activity. The key is the segregation of local recurrent inputs onto a dendritic compartment and teaching inputs onto a somatic compartment of an integrator neuron. Model instantiation for oculomotor control shows how a self-corrective teaching signal through the cerebellum can generate an integrator with both the dynamical and tuning properties necessary to drive eye muscles and maintain gaze angle. This bootstrap learning paradigm may be relevant for development and plasticity of temporal integration more generally.\n\nHighlights- A neuronal architecture that learns to integrate saccadic commands for eye position.\n- Learning is based on the recurrent dendritic prediction of somatic teaching signals.\n- Experiment and model show that no visual feedback is required for initial integrator learning.\n- Cerebellum is an internal teacher for motor nuclei and integrator population.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory learning and conditioning in the fruit fly is typically modelled by correlation-based associative synaptic plasticity. It was shown that the conditioning of an odor-evoked response by a shock depends on the connections from Kenyon cells (KC) to mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). Although on the behavioral level conditioning is recognized to be predictive, it remains unclear how MBONs form predictions of aversive or appetitive values (valences) of odors on the circuit level. We present behavioral experiments that are not well explained by associative plasticity between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, and we suggest two alternative models for how predictions can be formed. In error-driven predictive plasticity, dopaminergic neurons (DANs) represent the error between the predictive odor value and the shock strength. In target-driven predictive plasticity, the DANs represent the target for the predictive MBON activity. Predictive plasticity in KC-to-MBON synapses can also explain trace-conditioning, the valence-dependent sign switch in plasticity, and the observed novelty-familiarity representation. The model offers a framework to dissect MBON circuits and interpret DAN activity during olfactory learning.",

    "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial function lead to severe neuromuscular orphan pathologies known as mitochondrial disease. Among them, Leigh Syndrome is the most common pediatric presentation, characterized by symmetrical brain lesions, hypotonia, motor and respiratory deficits, and premature death. Mitochondrial diseases are characterized by a marked anatomical and cellular specificity. However, the molecular determinants for this susceptibility are currently unknown, hindering the efforts to find an effective treatment. Due to the complex crosstalk between mitochondria and their supporting cell, strategies to assess the underlying alterations in affected cell types in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction are critical. Here, we developed a novel virus-based tool, the AAV-mitoTag viral vector, to isolate mitochondria from genetically-defined cell types. Administration of the AAV-mitoTag in the vestibular neurons of a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome lacking the complex I subunit Ndufs4 allowed us to assess the proteome and acetylome of susceptible neurons in a well characterized model recapitulating the human disease. Our results show a marked reduction of complex-I N-module subunit abundance and an increase in the levels of the assembly factor NDUFA2. Transiently-associated non-mitochondrial proteins such as PKC{delta}, and the complement subcomponent C1Q were also increased in Ndufs4-deficient mitochondria. Furthermore, lack of Ndufs4 induced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) subunit hyperacetylation, leading to decreased PDH activity. We provide novel insight on the pathways involved in mitochondrial disease, which could underlie potential therapeutic approaches for these pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) utilizes changes in metabolic and hemodynamic signals to indirectly infer the underlying local changes in neuronal activity. To investigate the mechanisms of fMRI responses, spontaneous fluctuations, and functional connectivity in the resting-state, it is important to pursue fMRI in animal models. Animal studies commonly use dexmedetomidine sedation. It has been demonstrated that potent sensory stimuli administered under dexmedetomidine are prone to inducing seizures in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.\n\nHere we combined optical imaging of intrinsic signals and cerebral blood flow with neurophysiological recordings to measure responses in rat area S1FL to electrical forepaw stimulation administered at 8 Hz. We show that the increased susceptibility to seizures starts no later than 1 hour and ends no sooner than 3 hours after initiating a continuous administration of dexmedetomidine. By administering different combinations of anesthetic and sedative agents, we demonstrate that dexmedetomidine is the sole agent necessary for the increased susceptibility to seizures. The increased susceptibility to seizures prevails under a combination of 0.3%-0.5% isoflurane and dexmedetomidine anesthesia. The blood-oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses to seizures induced by forepaw stimulation have a higher amplitude and a larger spatial extent relative to physiological responses to the same stimuli. The epileptic activity and the associated blood oxygenation and cerebral blood flow responses stretched beyond the stimulation period. We observed seizures in response to forepaw stimulation with 1-2 mA pulses administered at 8 Hz. In contrast, responses to stimuli administered at 4 Hz were seizure-free. We demonstrate that such seizures are generated not only in SD rats but also in Long-Evans rats, but not in C57BL6 mice stimulated with similar potent stimuli under dexmedetomidine sedation.\n\nWe conclude that high-amplitude hemodynamic functional imaging responses evoked by peripheral stimulation in rats sedated with dexmedetomidine are possibly due to the induction of epileptic activity. Therefore, caution should be practiced in experiments that combine the administration of potent stimuli with dexmedetomidine sedation. We propose stimulation paradigms that elicit seizure-free, well detectable neurophysiological and hemodynamic responses in rats. We further conclude that the increased susceptibility to seizures under dexmedetomidine sedation is species dependent.",

We determine that BK currents are dependent on inward flow of Ca2+, and intracellular buffering of Ca2+. Entry of Ca2+ is further amplified locally by Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in close proximity to plasma membrane BK channels. Ca2+ imaging reveals peripheral clusters of high concentrations of Ca2+ that are suprathreshold to that needed to activate BK channels. PKA activation increases BK currents likely by recruiting more BK channels due to spatial spread of high Ca2+ concentrations in turn from increasing CICR. STORM imaging confirms the presence of nanodomains with ryanodine and IP3 receptors in close proximity to the Slo subunit of BK channels. Together, these data require a rethinking of how electrical resonance is brought about and suggest effects of CICR in synaptic release. Both genders were included in this study.",

    "abstract": "Microgravity or the condition of apparent weightlessness causes bone, muscular and immune system dysfunctions in astronauts following spaceflights. These organ and system-level dysfunctions correlate with changes induced at the single cell level both by simulated microgravity on earth as well as microgravity conditions in outer space (as in the international space station). Reported changes in single bone cells, muscle cells and white blood cells include structural/morphological abnormalities, changes in gene expression, protein expression, metabolic pathways and signaling pathways, suggesting that cells mount some response or adjustment to microgravity. However, the implications of such adjustments on many cellular functions and responses are not clear largely because the primary mechanism of gravity sensing in animal cells is unknown. Here we used a rotary cell culture system developed by NASA, to subject leukemic and erythroleukemic cancer cells to microgravity for 48 hours and then quantified their innate immune-response to common anti-cancer drugs using biophysical parameters and our recently developed quantum-dots-based fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that leukemic cancer cells treated with daunorubicin show increased chemotactic migration (p < 0.01) following simulated microgravity (g) compared to normal gravity on earth (1g). However, cells treated with doxorubicin showed enhanced migration both in 1g and following g. Our results show that microgravity modulates cancer cell response to chemotherapy in a drug-dependent manner. These results suggest using simulated microgravity as an immunomodulatory tool for the development of new immunotherapies for both space and terrestrial medicine.",

    "abstract": "G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling triggered by Folded gastrulation (Fog) is one of the pathways known to regulate glial organization and morphogenesis in the embryonic CNS in Drosophila. Fog is best known for its role in epithelial morphogenesis during gastrulation. Here, the signaling pathway includes GPCRs Mist and Smog and the G-Protein Concertina (Cta) which activate downstream effectors to bring about cytoskeletal changes essential for cell shape change\n\nIn this study, we identify molecular players that mediate and serve as important regulators of Fog signaling in the embryonic CNS. We find that while Cta is essential for Fog signaling neither receptors, Mist nor Smog mediates signaling in the CNS. On the contrary, we find that Smog functions as a negative regulator of the pathway. Surprisingly, Heartless which encodes a fibroblast growth factor receptor, also functions as a negative regulator of Fog signaling. Further, we find that both heartless and smog interact in a synergistic manner to regulate Fog signaling.\n\nThis study thus identifies novel regulators of Fog signaling that may play an important role in fine-tuning the pathway to control cell morphogenesis. It also suggests the likelihood of there being multiple receptors for Fog that mediate and regulate signaling in a context specific manner.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn Drosophila, Folded gastrulation (Fog) functions as ligand that signals via GPCRs to regulate cell shape during gastrulation -one of the earliest events in embryogenesis. Here, Fog signals via receptors Mist and Smog to activate the G-protein Concertina to elicit change in cell shape. In the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) this pathway regulates shape and organization of glia important for functions such as insulation of neurons and synapses.\n\nThe mechanism of Fog signal transduction in the CNS and its regulation is not well understood. We have sought to address these questions in our study. We find that Concertina is an essential factor for Fog signaling in the CNS but interestingly Mist is not. In contrast, Smog functions as a negative regulator such that loss of Smog enhances Fog signaling. A similar role is played by the receptor tyrosine kinase-Heartless. Interestingly, we find that Smog and Heartless interact as part of a common genetic network to regulate Fog signaling. Our results thus provide novel insights into the regulation of Fog signaling and shed light on how signaling can be fine-tuned in a context dependent manner to control cell shape change which plays a critical role during development and organ formation.",

    "abstract": "About 1-2% of European population are redhaired, meaning they synthesize more pheomelanin than eumelanin, the main melanin pigment. Several mutations could be responsible for this phenotype. It has been suggested that corresponding mutations spread in Europe due to a founder effect shaped either by a relaxation of selection for dark, UV-protective phenotypes or by sexual selection in favor of rare phenotypes. In our study, we investigated the levels of vitamin D precursor calcidiol and folic acid in the blood serum of 73 redhaired and 130 non-redhaired individuals. In redhaired individuals, we found higher calcidiol concentrations and approximately the same folic acid concentrations as in non-redhaired subjects. Calcidiol concentrations correlated with the intensity of hair redness measured by two spectrophotometric methods and estimated by participants themselves and by independent observers. In non-redhaired individuals, calcidiol levels covaried with the amount of sun exposure and intensity of suntan while in redhaired individuals, this was not the case. It suggests that increased calcidiol levels in redhaired individuals are due to differences in physiology rather than in behavior. We also found that folic acid levels increased with age and the intensity of baldness and decreased with the frequency of visiting tanning salons. Our results suggest that the redhaired phenotype could be an evolutionary adaptation for sufficient photosynthesis of provitamin D in conditions of low intensity of UV-B radiation in central and northern parts of Europe.",

Previous studies conducted in terrestrial taxa suggest that life history traits correlate with the efficiency of purifying selection and accumulation of deleterious mutations. Using a large genome dataset of 76 species of fishes, we show that the rate of deleterious mutation accumulation (measured via dN/dS, i.e. non-synonymous over synonymous substitution rate) is associated to the vulnerability, the life-history strategies, and the latitude of species. Our results, focusing on a large clade of aquatic species, generalizes previous patterns found so far in few clades of terrestrial vertebrates. These results also suggest that vulnerable species accumulate more deleterious substitutions than non-threatened ones, which give insights in how life-history traits, populations sizes and genetic risk of extinction can be tightly interconnected.",

More than 400 point mutations have been identified in Nav1.5 that are associated with cardiac disorders exemplified by type 3 long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome, making Nav1.5 a common target for class I antiarrythmic drugs. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of Nav1.5 bound to quinidine and TTX with resolutions at 3.2 [A] and 3.3 [A], respectively, for the pore domain. The structures allow mapping of 278 disease-related mutations in the resolved region, establishing the framework for mechanistic investigation of these pathogenic mutations. Quinidine is positioned right below the selectivity filter and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of a Tyr residue that leads to intracellular gate closure. Structural comparison of Nav1.5 with our previously reported Nav1.2/1.4/1.7 reveals the molecular determinant for the different susceptibility to TTX by TTX-resistant and -sensitive Nav subtypes, and highlights the functional significance of the underexplored and least conserved extracellular loops.",

One paradigm that induces cells to correlate their motions is contact inhibition of locomotion, by which cells migrating away from the contact site. Here, we report that tail-following behavior at the contact site, termed contact following locomotion (CFL), can induce a non-trivial collective behavior in migrating cells. We show the emergence of a traveling band showing polar order in a mutant Dictyostelium cell that lacks chemotactic activity. The traveling band is dynamic in the sense that it continuously assembled at the front of the band and disassembled at the back. A mutant cell lacking cell adhesion molecule TgrB1 did not show both the traveling band formation and CFL. We thus conclude that CFL is the cell-cell interaction underlying the traveling band formation. We then develop an agent-based simulation with CFL, which shows the role of CFL in the formation of traveling band. We further show that the polar order phase consists of subpopulations that exhibit characteristic transversal motions with respect to the direction of band propagation. These findings describe a novel mechanism of collective cell migration involving cell-cell interactions capable of inducing traveling band with polar order.",

We find that Panx1 protomers harbor four transmembrane helices similar in arrangement to other large-pore forming proteins but assemble as a heptameric channel with a unique gate formed by Trp74 in the extracellular loop. Mutating Trp74 or the nearby Arg75 disrupt ion selectivity whereas altering residues in the hydrophobic groove formed by the two extracellular loops abrogates channel inhibition by carbenoxolone.

We also conducted a systematic analysis of other genetic variants potentially related to maternal behavior in our Long-Evans rat population. We found that dopamine receptor 2 (rs107017253) variation interacted with the relationship between early-life maternal care received and dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens which, in turn, were associated with later-life maternal care provisioning. We also discovered and validated new variants that were predicted by our systematic analysis.

We visualize the division process with confocal fluorescence microscopy and derive a conceptual model based on the vesicle geometry. The model successfully predicts the shape transformations over time as well as the time point of the final pinching of the daughter vesicles. Remarkably, we show that two fundamentally distinct yet highly abundant processes - water evaporation and metabolic activity - can both regulate the autonomous division of GUVs.

However, patients with brain metastasis are excluded from the trials because the brain is viewed traditionally as an immune-privileged organ. The composition and properties of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in metastatic brain tumors are mostly unknown. To depict the baseline landscape of the composition, gene signature, and functional states of these immune cells, we performed - single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) for 12,196cellsafter data preprocessing, including 2,241 immunecells from three surgically removed brain lesions of treatment-naive NSCLC patients. We found a lack of T lymphocyte infiltration and activation, as well as the vast expansion of tumor-associated macrophage(TAM) in the brain lesions of NSCLC patients. By comparing our scRNAseq dataset with published data from early and late-stage primary NSCLC tumors, we showed that this compromised T cell response is unique to brain lesions. We identified a unique alternative activation (M2) gene expression pattern of the TAM in the brain metastasis and a lack of known T cell co-stimulator expression. Accumulation of M2 polarized TAM may, therefore, cause the comprised anti-tumor T cell response in metastatic brain lesions. These findings can contribute to the design of new immunotherapy strategies for NSCLC patients with brain metastasis.",

    "abstract": "In their quest for autonomy, tumor cells are known to reroute metabolic networks to aid their proliferation and survival. These metabolic alterations are governed by the tumor sub-population, thereby contributing towards an additional layer of complexity within the already heterogeneous tumor. For instance, bulk proliferative tumor cells rely on completely different pathways for their metabolic requirements as opposed to the stem-like metastatic cells. However, the molecular switch that drives these metabolic changes remains unknown. RhoC is a well-established contributor towards multiple aspects of tumor development including proliferation, EMT, migration, invasion and metastasis. A transcriptomics-based approach on a RhoC overexpressing cervical cancer cell line unveiled distinct metabolic signatures existent in these cells. Oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, nucleic acid metabolism and fatty acid elongation were some of the specific pathways that emerged as up-regulated. This study therefore provides insight into the intricate metabolic circuitry functional in aggressive RhoC-high cells and thus proposes a pivotal role for RhoC in oncometabolism.",

Freshly drawn blood from healthy volunteers and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or dermatomyositis was incubated with compounds at 0.1 or 1 M and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 g/mL) to induce a pro-inflammatory condition. Plasma was collected after 24 hours for lipid profiling using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and IL-8 quantification using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Each compound was tested in at least four donors at one concentration based on prior knowledge of binding affinities and in vitro activity. Our screening suggested that PD0325901 (MEK-1/2 inhibitor), trametinib (MEK-1/2 inhibitor), and selumetinib (MEK-1 inhibitor) decreased while tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) increased PGE2 production. These findings were validated by concentration-response experiment in two donors. Moreover, the tested MEK inhibitors decreased thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production and IL-8 secretion. We also investigated the lysophophatidylcholine (LPC) profile in plasma from treated whole blood as these lipids are potentially important mediators in inflammation, and we did not observe any changes in LPC profiles. Collectively, we deployed a semi-high throughput and robust methodology to investigate anti-inflammatory properties of new chemical probes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInhibitors for MEK decreased PGE2 and TXB2 production\nC_LIO_LIInhibitors for MEK and ERK decreased IL-8 secretion\nC_LIO_LIJAK inhibitor tofacitinib increased PGE2 and TXB2 production\nC_LI",

Moreover, proteomic experiments revealed that DRB1 protein interacts with many transcription factors. Finally, we show that the action of DRB1 is not limited to MIR genes as it impacts expression of many other genes, majority of which are involved in plant response to light.

We and others previously reported that Tim-3 exerts apparently paradoxical co-stimulatory activity in T cells (and other cells), including enhancement of ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation (pS6). Here we examined the upstream signaling pathways that control Tim3-mediated increases in pS6 in T cells. We have also defined the localization of Tim-3 relative to the T cell immune synapse and impacts on downstream signaling. Recruitment of Tim-3 to the immune synapse was mediated exclusively by the transmembrane domain, replacement of which impaired Tim-3 co-stimulation of pS6. Strikingly, enforced localization of the Tim-3 cytoplasmic domain to the immune synapse in the context of a chimeric antigen receptor still allowed for robust T cell activation. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby Tim-3 enhances TCR-proximal signaling under acute conditions.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHere we define elements of signaling and localization associated with Tim-3 co-stimulatory function in T cells.",

    "abstract": "Small (s)RNA molecules are crucial factors in the communication between hosts and their interacting pathogens/pests that can modulate both host defense and microbial virulence/pathogenicity known as cross-kingdom RNA interference (ckRNAi). Consistent with this, sRNAs and their double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors have been adopted to control plant diseases through exogenously applied RNA biopesticides, known as spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS). While RNA spray proved to be effective, the mechanisms underlying the transfer and uptake of SIGS-associated RNAs are inadequately understood. Moreover, the use of the SIGS-technology as a biopesticide will require the systemic spreading of dsRNA/siRNA signals. Our results strongly support the notion of phloem-mediated long-distance movement of SIGS-associated dsRNA and/or siRNA. These findings are significant contributions to our mechanistic understanding of RNA spray technology, as our previous data indicate that SIGS requires the processing of dsRNAs by the fungal RNAi machinery. In summary, our findings support the model that SIGS involves: (i) uptake of sprayed dsRNA by the plant (via stomata); (ii) transfer of apoplastic dsRNAs into the symplast (DCL processing into siRNAs); (iii) systemic translocation of siRNA or unprocessed dsRNA via the vascular system (phloem/xylem); (iv) uptake of apoplastic dsRNA or symplastic dsRNA/siRNA depending on the lifestyle/feeding behavior of the pathogen/pest.",

    "abstract": "During human walking, step width is predicted by mediolateral motion of the pelvis, a relationship that can be attributed to a combination of passive body dynamics and active sensorimotor control. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether humans modulate the active control of step width in response to a novel mechanical environment. Participants were repeatedly exposed to a force-field that either assisted or perturbed the normal relationship between pelvis motion and step width, separated by washout periods to detect the presence of potential after-effects. As intended, force-field assistance directly strengthened the relationship between pelvis displacement and step width. This relationship remained strengthened with repeated exposure to assistance, and returned to baseline afterward, providing minimal evidence for assistance-driven changes in active control. In contrast, force-field perturbations directly weakened the relationship between pelvis motion and step width. Repeated exposure to perturbations diminished this negative direct effect, and produced larger positive after-effects once the perturbations ceased. Both of these results provide evidence of gradual changes in active control in response to perturbations. In the longer term, these methods may be useful for improving deficits in the active control of step width often observed among clinical populations with poor walking balance.",

    "abstract": "Cellular movement is a complex dynamic process, resulting from the interaction of multiple elements at the intra and extra-cellular levels. This epiphenomenon presents a variety of behaviors, which can include normal and anomalous diffusion or collective migration. In some cases cells can get neighborhood information through chemical or mechanical cues. A unified understanding about how such information can influence the dynamics of cell movement is still lacking. In order to improve our comprehension of cell migration we consider a cellular Potts model where cells move actively in the direction of a driving field. The intensity of this driving field is constant, while its orientation can evolves according to two alternative dynamics based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In the first case, the next orientation of the driving field depends on the previous direction of the field. In the second case, the direction update considers the mean orientation performed by the cell in previous steps. Thus, the latter update rule mimics the ability of cells to perceive the environment, avoiding obstacles and thus increasing the cellular displacement. Our results indicate that both dynamics introduce temporal and spatial correlations in cell velocity in a friction coefficient and cell density dependent manner. Furthermore, we observe alternating regimes in the mean square displacement, with normal and anomalous diffusion. The crossovers between superdiffusive and diffusive regimes, are strongly affected by both the driving field dynamics and cell-cell interactions. In this sense, when cell polarization update grants information about the previous cellular displacement decreases the duration of the diffusive regime, in particular for high density cultures.",

However, the genetic barrier for resistance to stem bnAbs has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we performed a series of deep mutational scanning experiments to probe for resistance mutations. We found that the genetic barrier to resistance to stem bnAbs is generally very low for the H3 subtype but substantially higher for the H1 subtype. Several resistance mutations in H3 cannot be neutralized by stem bnAbs at the highest concentration tested, do not reduce in vitro viral fitness and in vivo pathogenicity, and are often present in circulating strains as minor variants. Thus, H3 HAs have a higher propensity than H1 HAs to escape major stem bnAbs and creates a potential challenge in the development of a bona fide universal influenza vaccine.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAcquisition of resistance by influenza virus to broadly neutralizing hemagglutinin stem antibodies varies tremendously depending on subtype.",

GM15 recapitulates extensively the functionalities found in the C57BL/6J SOPF microbiota metagenome, and GM15 animals are phenotypically similar to SOPF or SPF animals in two different facilities.

    "abstract": "Missense variants in Kirrel3 are repeatedly identified as risk factors for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability but it has not been reported if or how these variants disrupt Kirrel3 function. Previously, we studied Kirrel3 loss-of-function using knockout mice and showed that Kirrel3 is a synaptic adhesion molecule necessary to form one specific type of hippocampal synapse in vivo. Here, we developed a new gain-of-function assay for Kirrel3 and find that wild-type Kirrel3 induces synapse formation selectively between Kirrel3-expressing cells via homophilic, trans-cellular binding. We tested six disease-associated Kirrel3 missense variants and find that five attenuate this synaptogenic function. All variants tested traffic to the cell surface and localize to synapses similar to wild-type Kirrel3. Two tested variants lack homophilic trans-cellular binding, which likely accounts for their reduced synaptogenic function. Interestingly, we also identified variants that bind in trans but cannot induce synapses, indicating Kirrel3 trans-cellular binding is necessary but not sufficient for its synaptogenic function. Collectively, these results suggest Kirrel3 functions as a synaptogenic, cell-recognition molecule, and this function is attenuated by missense variants associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Thus, we provide critical insight to Kirrel3 function in typical brain development and the consequences of missense variants associated with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHere, we advance our understanding of mechanisms mediating target-specific synapse formation by providing evidence that Kirrel3 trans-cellular interactions mediate contact recognition and signaling to promote synapse development. Moreover, this is the first study to test the effects of disease-associated Kirrel3 missense variants on synapse formation, and thereby, provides a framework to understand the etiology of complex neurodevelopmental disorders arising from rare missense variants in synaptic genes.",

    "abstract": "Mild replication stress enhances appearance of dozens of robust recurrent genomic break clusters, termed RDCs, in cultured primary mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Robust RDCs occur within genes (\"RDC-genes\") that are long and have roles in neural cell communications and/or have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases or cancer. We sought to develop an in vitro approach to determine whether specific RDC formation is associated with neural development. For this purpose, we adapted a system to induce neural progenitor cell (NPC) development from mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines deficient for XRCC4 plus p53, a genotype that enhances DNA double-strand break (DSB) persistence to enhance detection. We tested for RDCs by our genome wide DSB identification approach that captures DSBs genome-wide via their ability to join to specific genomic Cas9/sgRNA-generated bait DSBs. In XRCC4/p53-deficient ES cells, we detected 7 RDCs, which were in genes, with two RDCs being robust. In contrast, in NPCs derived from these ES cell lines, we detected 29 RDCs, a large fraction of which were robust and associated with long, transcribed neural genes that were also robust RDC-genes in primary NSPCs. These studies suggest that many RDCs present in NSPCs are developmentally influenced to occur in this cell type and indicate that induced development of NPCs from ES cells provides an approach to rapidly elucidate mechanistic aspects of NPC RDC formation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe previously discovered a set of long neural genes susceptible to frequent DNA breaks in primary mouse brain progenitor cells. We termed these genes RDC-genes. RDC-gene breakage during brain development might alter neural gene function and contribute to neurological diseases and brain cancer. To provide an approach to characterize the unknown mechanism of neural RDC-gene breakage, we asked whether RDC-genes appear in neural progenitors differentiated from embryonic stem cells in culture. Indeed, robust RDC-genes appeared in neural progenitors differentiated in culture and many overlapped with robust RDC-genes in primary brain progenitors. These studies indicate that in vitro development of neural progenitors provides a model system for elucidating how RDC-genes are formed.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an immunosuppressive cell type found in high abundance in early life. Currently, there has been limited mechanistic understanding of MDSC phagocytosis of bacteria and the corresponding consequences in the context of acute infection. We set out to determine whether human granulocytic MDSCs have phagocytic capacity that is comparable to other professional phagocytes. To investigate these properties, we utilized fluorescent confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and bacterial burden assays. We demonstrate that human granulocytic MDSCs phagocytose E. coli O1:K1:H7, and subsequently traffic the bacteria into acidic compartments similar to other phagocytes. However, MDSCs were significantly less efficient at bacterial uptake and killing compared to monocytes. This activity is associated with an inflammatory response, but the amount of TNF gene and protein expression was reduced in infected MDSCs compared to monocytes. Interestingly, we also found that MDSCs release DNA (MeDNA) into the extracellular space that resembles neutrophil extracellular traps. We found that MeDNA had some impact on bacterial viability in single cultures, with an increase in bacterial recovery in MDSCs treated with DNAse. However, MeDNA did not impact the ability of monocytes to eliminate bacteria in co-cultures, suggesting that MDSC extracellular DNA does not compromise monocyte function. Overall, our data reveals mechanistic insight into MDSC activity during infection that includes the kinetics and efficiency of bacterial uptake, elimination through trafficking to acidified compartments, and inflammatory contributions relative to primary human monocytes. These results enhance our understanding of MDSC contributions during acute bacterial infection and identify host-directed targets for immune intervention to improve outcomes and reduce susceptibility to infection early in life.",

    "abstract": "Single neurons can dynamically change the gain of their spiking responses to account for shifts in stimulus variance. Moreover, gain adaptation can occur across multiple timescales. Here, we examine the ability of a simple statistical model of spike trains, the generalized linear model (GLM), to account for these adaptive effects. The GLM describes spiking as a Poisson process whose rate depends on a linear combination of the stimulus and recent spike history. The GLM successfully replicates gain scaling observed in Hodgkin-Huxley simulations of cortical neurons that occurs when the ratio of spike-generating potassium and sodium conductances approaches one. Gain scaling in the GLM depends on the length and shape of the spike history filter. Additionally, the GLM captures adaptation that occurs over multiple timescales as a fractional derivative of the stimulus variance, which has been observed in neurons that include long timescale after hyperpolarization conductances. Fractional differentiation in GLMs requires long spike history that span several seconds. Together, these results demonstrate that the GLM provides a tractable statistical approach for examining single-neuron adaptive computations in response to changes in stimulus variance.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent chromosomal translocations are found in many blood and solid cancers. Balanced translocations, frequent in lymphoid malignancies, lead to the formation of two aberrant derivative (der) chromosomes. This event often leads to overexpression of an oncogene. In many cases, the expression of an oncogene is not enough to produce a malignant phenotype; however, most part of the studies focus on the events involving the chromosome where the oncogene is located, but rarely the other der chromosome where other oncogenic alterations may potentially arise. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is a perfect example of this. In 85% of the cases, it is characterized by the translocation t(11;14), which leads to the overexpression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene which results juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene on the der14 chromosome. This feature alone is not sufficient to induce oncogenesis. Here we focused on the der11 chromosome. We demonstrated that expression of 88 genes located in a 15mb region close to the translocation breakpoint on the der11 was deregulated both in the GRANTA-519 MCL cell line and in B-cells from MCL patients. We found that a large segment of der11containing deregulated genes was relocated from its normal position in the nuclear periphery towards the center of the nucleus in close proximity to the nucleolus where the abundant nucleolar protein nucleolin binds a subset of genes located close to the breakpoint and activates their expression. This finding allowed to identify new potential oncogenes involved in MCL and the mechanisms of their upregulation.",

    "abstract": "Host-parasitoid population dynamics is often probed using a semi-discrete/hybrid modeling framework. Here, the update functions in the discrete-time model connecting year-to-year changes in the population densities are obtained by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically describe interactions when hosts become vulnerable to parasitoid attacks. We use this semi-discrete formalism to study two key spatial effects: local movement (migration) of parasitoids between patches during the vulnerable period; and yearly redistribution of populations across patches outside the vulnerable period. Our results show that in the absence of any redistribution, constant density-independent migration and parasitoid attack rates are unable to stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasitoid population dynamics. Interestingly, inclusion of host redistribution (but not parasitoid redistribution) before the start of the vulnerable period can lead to stable coexistence of both species. Next, we consider a Type-III functional response (parasitoid attack rate increases with host density), where the absence of any spatial effects leads to a neutrally stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. As before, density-independent parasitoid migration by itself is again insufficient to stabilize the population dynamics and host redistribution provides a stabilizing influence. Finally, we show that a Type-III functional response combined with density-dependent parasitoid migration leads to stable coexistence, even in the absence of population redistributions. In summary, we have systematically characterized parameter regimes leading to stable/unstable population dynamics with different forms of spatial heterogeneity coupled to the parasitoids functional response using mechanistically formulated semi-discrete models.",

    "abstract": "Corals are ecosystem engineers of the coral reefs, one of the most biodiverse but severely threatened marine ecosystems. The ability of corals to form the three dimensional structure of reefs depends on the precipitation of calcium carbonate under biologically control. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this biologically controlled biomineralization remain to be fully unelucidated, for example whether corals employ a different molecular machinery for the deposition of different calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs (i.e., aragonite or calcite). Here we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to compare skeletogenic proteins, i.e., the proteins occluded in the skeleton of three octocoral and one scleractinian species: Tubipora musica and Sinularia cf. cruciata, both forming calcite sclerites, the blue coral Heliopora coerulea with an aragonitic rigid skeleton, and the scleractinian aragonitic Montipora digitata. We observed extremely low overlap between aragonitic and calcitic species, while a core set of proteins is shared between octocorals producing calcite sclerites. However, the same carbonic anhydrase (CruCA4) is employed for the formation of skeletons of both polymorphs. Similarities could also be observed between octocorals and scleractinians, including the presence of a galaxin-like protein. Additionally, as in scleractinians, some octocoral skeletogenic proteins, such as acidic proteins and scleritin, appear to have been secondarily co-opted for calcification and likely derive from proteins playing different extracellular functions. In H. coerulea, co-option was characterized by aspartic acid-enrichment of proteins. This work represents the first attempt to identify the molecular basis underlying coral skeleton polymorph diversity, providing several new research targets and enabling both future functional and evolutionary studies aimed at elucidating the origin and evolution of biomineralization in corals.",

    "abstract": "Although ketamine represents a new line of antidepressants with unique clinical advantages, its use as a long-term treatment has limitations, particularly its dissociative/psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential. In rats, we observed that a subanesthetic dose of ketamine (10mg/kg) induced a 3-fold increase in corticosterone (CORT) levels in both serum and brain tissue, within an hour of administration. This increase took place in both male and female rats, in both naive and stressed animals. However, no CORT increase was detected in rats injected with (2R, 6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), an active metabolite of ketamine, that is believed to contribute to ketamines antidepressant effect. In response to the release in CORT, ketamine injected animals displayed a significant increase in the expression of sgk1, a downstream effector of glucocorticoid receptor signaling, in the hippocampus indicating the initiation of a transcriptional program. We hypothesized this surge in CORT release was a manifestation of stress experienced by the rat in response to ketamines psychotropic effects. When sensory perception was blocked under isoflurane anesthesia, administration of ketamine did not increase circulating CORT levels as compared to animals injected with saline. Taken together, ketamine administration triggers a behavioral stress response that has downstream molecular consequences. The resulting CORT release, virtually concurrent with the timing of ketamines rapid-acting antidepressant actions, necessitates the consideration of this pathways potential involvement when trying to dissect out the relevant molecular mechanisms underlying ketamines action.",

    "abstract": "Growth factors and cytokines activate signal transduction pathways and regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. Intracellular domains of activated receptors recruit several protein kinases as well as transcription factors that serve as platforms or hubs for the assembly of multi-protein complexes. The signaling hubs involved in a related biologic function often share common interaction proteins and target genes. This functional connectivity suggests that a pairwise comparison of protein interaction partners of signaling hubs and network analysis of common partners and their expression analysis might lead to the identification of critical nodes in cellular signaling. A pairwise comparison of signaling hubs across several related pathways might also reveal novel signaling modules. Analysis of Protein Interaction Connectome by Venn (PIC-VENN) of transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, NFKB1, RELA, FOS and JUN, and their common interaction network suggested that BRCA1 and TSC22D3 function as critical nodes in immune responses by connecting the signaling nodes into signaling modules. Mutations or differential expression levels of these critical nodes in pathological conditions might deregulate signaling pathways and their target genes involved in inflammation. Biological connectivity emerges from the structural connectivity of interaction networks across several signaling hubs in related pathways. Application of PIC-VENN to several signaling hubs might reveal novel nodes and modules that can be targeted to simultaneously activate or inhibit cell signaling in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Embryos must communicate instructions to their constituent cells over long distances. These instructions are often encoded in the concentration of signals called morphogens. In the textbook view, morphogen molecules diffuse from a localized source to form a concentration gradient, and target cells adopt fates by measuring the local morphogen concentration. However, natural patterning systems often incorporate numerous co-factors and extensive signaling feedback, suggesting that embryos require additional mechanisms to generate signaling patterns. Here, we examine the mechanisms of signaling pattern formation for the mesendoderm inducer Nodal during zebrafish embryogenesis. We find that Nodal signaling activity spans a normal range in the absence of signaling feedback, suggesting that diffusion is sufficient for Nodal gradient formation. We further show that the range of endogenous Nodal ligands is set by the EGF-CFC co-receptor Oep: in the absence of Oep, Nodal ligands spread to form a nearly uniform distribution throughout the embryo. In turn, increasing Oep levels sensitizes cells to Nodal ligands. We recapitulate these experimental results with a computational model in which Oep regulates the diffusive spread of Nodal ligands by setting the rate of capture by target cells. This model predicts, and we confirm in vivo, the surprising observation that a failure to replenish Oep during patterning transforms the Nodal signaling gradient into a travelling wave. These results reveal that patterns of Nodal morphogen signaling are shaped by co-receptor-mediated restriction of ligand spread and cell sensitization.",

    "abstract": "The question of how neurons embedded in a network update their synaptic weights to collectively achieve behavioral goals is a longstanding problem in systems neuroscience. Since Hebbs hypothesis [10] that cells that fire together strengthen their connections, cellular studies [6] have shed light on potential synaptic mechanisms underlying learning. These mechanisms have directly driven the careful hand design of biologically plausible models of learning and memory in computational neuroscience [1]. However, these hand designed rules have yet to achieve satisfying success training large neural networks, and are dramatically outperformed by biologically implausible approaches such as backprop. We propose an alternative paradigm for designing biologically plausible learning rules: using meta-learning to learn a parametric synaptic update rule which is capable of training deep networks. We demonstrate this approach by meta-learning an update rule for semi-supervised tasks, where sparse labels are provided to a deep network but the majority of inputs are unlabeled. The meta-learned plasticity rule integrates bottom-up, top-down, and recurrent inputs to each neuron, and generates weight updates as the product of pre- and post- synaptic neuronal outputs. The way in which the inputs to each neuron are combined to produce a learning signal, however, is itself a meta-learned function, parameterized by a neural network. Critically, the meta-learned update rule integrates only neuron-local information when proposing updates-that is, our learning rule is spatially localized to individual neurons. After meta-learning, the resulting synaptic update rule is capable of driving task-relevant learning for semi-supervised tasks. We demonstrate this capability on two simple classification problems. In general, we believe meta-learning to be a powerful approach to finding more effective synaptic plasticity rules, which will motivate new hypotheses for biological neural networks, and new algorithms for artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal CA1 is necessary to maintain experienced episodic memory in many species, including humans. To monitor the temporal dynamics of processing, we recorded multiple-unit firings of CA1 neurons in male rats experiencing one of four episodes for 10 min: restraint stress, social interaction with a female or male, or observation of a novel object. Before an experience, the neurons mostly exhibited sporadic firings with some synchronized (\u2248 50 ms) ripple-like firing events in habituated home cage. After experience onset, restraint or social interaction with other rats induced spontaneous high-frequency firings (super bursts) intermittently, while object observation induced the events inconsistently. Minutes after experience initiation, CA1 neurons frequently exhibited ripple-like firings with less-firing silent periods. The number of ripple-like events depended on the episode experienced and correlated with the total duration of super bursts. Experience clearly diversified multiple features of individual ripple-like events in an episode-specific manner, sustained for more than 30 min in the home cage.Ex vivo patch clamp analysis further revealed experience-promoted synaptic plasticity. Compared with unexposed controls, animals experiencing the female, male, or restraint episodes showed cell-dependently increased AMPA- or GABAA receptor\u2013 mediated postsynaptic currents, whereas contact with a novel object increased only GABAergic currents. Multivariate ANOVA in multi-dimensional virtual space revealed experience-specific super bursts with subsequent ripple-like events and synaptic plasticity, leading us to hypothesize that these factors are responsible for creating experience-specific memory. It is possible to decipher encrypted experience through the deep learning of the orchestrated ripple-like firings and synaptic plasticity in multiple CA1 neurons.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Through comparing how different warhead chemistry, reversible noncovalent (RNC), reversible covalent (RC), and irreversible covalent (IRC) binders, affects the degradation of Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), we serendipitously discover that cyano-acrylamide-based reversible covalent chemistry can significantly enhance the intracellular accumulation and target engagement of PROTACs and develop RC-1 as a reversible covalent BTK PROTAC with a high target occupancy as its corresponding kinase inhibitor and effectiveness as a dual functional inhibitor and degrader, a different mechanism-of-action for PROTACs.

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are a common component of the human diet with widely reported health-promoting properties. The gut microbiota transforms these compounds affecting the overall metabolic outcome of their consumption. Flavonoid-degrading bacteria are often studied in isolation under culture conditions that do not resemble the conditions in the colon and that eliminate the multiple interactions that take place in complex communities. In this study, a comparative metataxonomic analysis of fecal communities supplemented with the flavonoid quercetin led us to identify a potential competitive exclusion interaction between two sequence variants related to the flavonoid-degrading species, Flavonifractor plautii, that belong to the same genus but different species. During incubation of fecal slurries with quercetin, the relative abundance of these two variants was inversely correlated; one variant, ASV_65f4, increased in relative abundance in half of the libraries and the other variant, ASV_a45d, in the other half. This pattern was also observed with 6 additional fecal samples that were transplanted into germ-free mice fed two different diets. Mouses diet did not change the pattern of dominance of either variant, and initial relative abundances did not predict which one ended up dominating. Potential distinct metabolic capabilities of these two Flavonifractor-related species were evidenced, as only one variant, ASV_65f4, became consistently enriched in complex communities supplemented with acetate but no quercetin. Genomic comparison analysis of the close relatives of each variant revealed that ASV_65f4 may be an efficient ethanolamine-utilizing bacterium which may increase its fitness in media with no quercetin compared to ASV_a45d. Other discordant features between ASV_65f4- and ASV_a45d-related groups may be the presence of flagellar and galactose-utilization genes, respectively. Overall, we showed that the Flavonifractor genus harbors variants that present a pattern of negative co-occurrence and that may have different metabolic and structural traits, whether these differences affect the dynamic of quercetin degradation warrants further investigation.",

Here we show that, unlike knockout mice, Nr1d1 heterozygous mice are not susceptible to muscular atrophy and in fact paradoxically possess larger myofiber diameters and improved neuromuscular function, compared to wildtype mice. Heterozygous mice lacked dyslipidemia, a characteristic of Nr1d1 knockout mice and displayed increased whole-body fatty-acid oxidation during periods of inactivity (light cycle). Heterozygous mice also exhibited higher rates of glucose uptake when fasted, and had elevated basal rates of gluconeogenesis compared to wildtype and knockout littermates. Rev-erb ablation suppressed glycolysis and fatty acid-oxidation in white-adipose tissue (WAT), whereas partial Rev-erb loss, curiously stimulated these processes. Our investigations revealed that Rev-erb dose-dependently regulates glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in WAT and muscle.",

    "abstract": "To examine the effects of cognitive reserve (CR) and working memory (WM) load on the cognitive performance of young adults, we performed two event-related potential (ERP) experiments. The first experiment aims to show how high CR influences young adult performance as a function of two levels of working memory load (high vs. low) during a Sternberg task. For both positive and negative probes, participants with high and low CR showed larger P300 amplitudes to low WM loads than to high WM loads. Both CR groups showed a longer P300 latency to high WM loads than to low WM loads, but this difference was greater for the low CR group than for the high CR group. The high CR group displayed larger P300 amplitudes for every experimental condition compared to the low CR group. The second experiment analyzed grammatical gender agreement in sentence processing when CR and WM load were manipulated. Sentences varied according to the gender agreement of the noun and adjective, where the gender of the adjective either agreed or disagreed with that of the noun (agreement), and with regard to the number of words between the noun and the adjective in the sentence (WM load). Participants with high CR showed greater modulation of left anterior negativity (LAN) and P600a effects as WM increased than that observed in participants with low CR. The findings together suggest that higher levels of cognitive reserve improve neural efficiency, which may result in better working memory performance and sentence processing.",

    "abstract": "Speech fluency can be impaired in stressful situations. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a verbal fluency task without any further stress induction by itself induces responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).\n\nThe sample consisted of n = 85 participants (68.2% female; 33.3 {+/-} 15.2 years, BMI = 23.7 {+/-} 4.3 kg/m2) who performed two consecutive verbal fluency tasks for two minutes each. The categories were either  stress or  disease and  animals or  foods which were presented in a randomized order. Three saliva samples were collected, prior to the task (t0), immediately after (t1), and ten minutes after (t2). Salivary -amylase and cortisol were assessed. Furthermore, blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective ratings of actual stress perception, level of effort, and tiredness were measured.\n\nThe verbal fluency task induced an HPA axis response with a maximum cortisol level at t2 (p < .001, {eta}p2 = .19) which was independent of task performance. Furthermore, subjective stress and effort as well of tiredness increased immediately after the task (all p < .001; all d [&ge;] 1.0). Tiredness immediately after the task was negatively correlated with task performance (p = .002). No -amylase, blood pressure or heart rate responses were found.\n\nWe conclude that a verbal fluency task acts like an acute stressor that induces a cortisol response without the need of further (e.g., social-evaluative) stress components. Therefore, it is a little time-consuming alternative to other stress tasks that can be used in field studies with little effort.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFindings on the association between health literacy and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence are inconsistent. Health literacy is usually operationalized with simple tests of basic literacy, but more complex conceptions of health literacy include content knowledge. People living with chronic illness also conceptualize and experience illness in ways other than biomedical or mechanistic models of disease.\n\nObjectiveThere are no instruments that comprehensively assess knowledge of people living with HIV concerning HIV disease and treatment; or psychological adjustment to being HIV+. Little is known about the relationship between factual knowledge, or positive identification as HIV+, and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence.\n\nMethodsFormative work with in-depth semi-structured interviews, and cognitive testing, to develop a structured instrument assessing HIV-related knowledge, and personal meanings of living with HIV. Pilot administration of the instrument to a convenience sample of 101 respondents.\n\nKey ResultsRespondents varied considerably in their expressed need for in-depth knowledge, the accuracy of their understanding of relevant scientific concepts and facts about ARV treatment, and psychological adjustment and acceptance of HIV+ status. Most knowledge domains were not significantly related to self-reported ARV adherence, but accurate knowledge specifically about ARV treatment was (r=0.25, p=.02), as was an adapted version of the Need for Cognition scale (r=.256, p=.012). Negative feelings about living with HIV (r=.33, p=.0012), and medication taking (r=.276, p=.008) were significantly associated with non-adherence.\n\nConclusionThe instrument may be useful in diagnosing addressable reasons for non-adherence, as a component of psychoeducational interventions, and for evaluation of such interventions.\n\nPLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYWe developed a questionnaire for people with HIV. General knowledge about HIV wasnt related to whether people took their medications, but specific information about treatment was. People with lots of bad feelings about living with HIV were less likely to take medications as prescribed. People who liked to think more about their decisions were more likely to take their medications.",
