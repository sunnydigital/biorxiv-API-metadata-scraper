    "abstract": "Hi-C has become a popular technique in recent genome assembly projects. Hi-C exploits contact frequencies between pairs of loci to bridge and order contigs in draft genomes, resulting in chromosome-level assemblies. However, application of this approach is currently hampered by a lack of robust programs that are capable of effectively treating this type of data, particularly open source programs. We developed instaGRAAL, a complete overhaul of the GRAAL program, which has adapted the latter to allow efficient assembly of large genomes. Both GRAAL, and instaGRAAL use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Hi-C scaffolding, but instaGRAAL features a number of improvements including a modular polishing approach that optionally integrates independent data. To validate the program, we used it to generate chromosome-level assemblies for two brown algae, Desmarestia herbacea and the model Ectocarpus sp., and quantified improvements compared to the initial draft for the latter. Overall, instaGRAAL is a program able to generate, using default parameters with minimal human intervention, near-complete assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome contains several million cis-regulatory elements, whose differential activity marked by open chromatin determines organogenesis and differentiation. This activity is itself embedded in the DNA sequence, decoded by sequence-specific transcription factors. Leveraging a granular ATAC-seq atlas of chromatin activity across 81 immune cell-types we show that a convolutional neural network (\"AI-TAC\") can learn to infer cell-type-specific chromatin activity solely from the DNA sequence. AI-TAC does so by rediscovering, with astonishing precision, binding motifs for known regulators, and some unknown ones, mapping them with high concordance to positions validated by ChIP-seq data. AI-TAC also uncovers combinatorial influences, establishing a hierarchy of transcription factors (TFs) and their interactions involved in immunocyte specification, with intriguingly different strategies between lineages. Mouse-trained AI-TAC can parse human DNA, revealing a strikingly similar ranking of influential TFs. Thus, Deep Learning can reveal the regulatory syntax that drives the full differentiative complexity of the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbial communities can respond to antibiotic perturbations by rapidly altering their taxonomic and functional composition. However, little is known about the strain-level processes that drive this collective response. Here we characterize the gut microbiome of a single individual at high temporal and genetic resolution through a period of health, disease, antibiotic treatment, and recovery. We used deep, linked-read metagenomic sequencing to track the longitudinal trajectories of thousands of single nucleotide variants within 36 species, which allowed us to contrast these genetic dynamics with the ecological fluctuations at the species level. We found that antibiotics can drive rapid shifts in the genetic composition of individual species, often involving incomplete genome-wide sweeps of pre-existing variants. These genetic changes were frequently observed in species without obvious changes in species abundance, emphasizing the importance of monitoring diversity below the species level. We also found that many sweeping variants quickly reverted to their baseline levels once antibiotic treatment had concluded, demonstrating that the ecological resilience of the microbiota can sometimes extend all the way down to the genetic level. Our results provide new insights into the population genetic forces that shape individual microbiomes on therapeutically relevant timescales, with potential implications for personalized health and disease.",

    "abstract": "In the era of bioinformatics and metagenomics, the study of the ruminal microbiome has gained considerable relevance in the field of animal breeding, since the composition of the rumen microbiota significantly impacts production and the environment. Illumina sequencing is considered the gold standard for the analysis of microbiomes, but it is limited by obtaining only short DNA sequences to analyze. As an alternative, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has developed a new sequencing technique based on nanopores that can be carried out in the MinION, a portable device with a low initial cost which long DNA readings can be obtained with. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of both types of sequencing applied to samples of ruminal content using a similar pipeline. The ONT sequencing provided similar results to the Illumina sequencing, although it was able to classify a greater number of readings at the species level, possibly due to the increase in the read size. The results also suggest that, due to the size of the reads, it would be possible to obtain the same amount of information in a smaller number of hours. However, detection of archaeal and eukaryotic species is still difficult to accomplish due to their low abundance in the rumen compared to bacteria, suggesting different pipelines and strategies are needed to obtain a whole representation of the less abundant species in the rumen microbiota.",

GABA has well-defined signalling roles in animals; however, whilst GABA accumulates in plants under stress it has not been determined if, how, where and when GABA acts as an endogenous plant signalling molecule. Here, we establish that endogenous GABA is a bona fide plant signal, acting via a mechanism not found in animals. GABA antagonises stomatal movement in response to opening and closing stimuli in multiple plant families including dicot and monocot crops. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we show guard cell GABA production is necessary and sufficient to influence stomatal aperture, transpirational water loss and drought tolerance via inhibition of stomatal guard cell plasma membrane and tonoplast-localised anion transporters. This study proposes a novel role for GABA - as a  stress memory - opening new avenues for improving plant stress tolerance.",

This is not only limited to traditional model species: given the ability to culture and visualize a specific organism, we can capture both its structural and functional attributes. We present a quantitative model for the colonial diatom Bacillaria paradoxa, an organism that presents a number of unique attributes in terms of form and function. To acquire a digital model of B. paradoxa, we extract a series of quantitative parameters from microscopy videos from both primary and secondary sources. These data are then analyzed using a variety of techniques, including two rival deep learning approaches. We provide an overview of neural networks for non-specialists as well as present a series of analysis on Bacillaria phenotype data. The application of deep learning networks allows for two analytical purposes. Application of the DeepLabv3 pre-trained model extracts phenotypic parameters describing the shape of cells constituting Bacillaria colonies. Application of a semantic model trained on nematode embryogenesis data (OpenDevoCell) provides a means to analyze masked images of potential intracellular features. We also advance the analysis of Bacillaria colony movement dynamics by using templating techniques and biomechanical analysis to better understand the movement of individual cells relative to an entire colony. The broader implications of these results are presented, with an eye towards future applications to both hypothesis-driven studies and theoretical advancements in understanding the dynamic morphology of Bacillaria.",

We apply this method to detect and quantify pausing in initial transcription at 411 ([~]4,000,000) promoter sequences in vivo, in Escherichia coli. The results show initial-transcription pausing can occur in each nucleotide addition during initial transcription, particularly the first 4-5 nucleotide additions. The results further show initial-transcription pausing occurs at sequences that resemble the consensus sequence element for transcription-elongation pausing. Our findings define the positional and sequence determinants for initial-transcription pausing and establish initial-transcription pausing is hard-coded by sequence elements similar to those for transcription-elongation pausing.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated stimulation of endocrine pancreas function by vagal nerve electrical stimulation. While this increases insulin secretion; concomitant reductions in circulating glucose do not occur. A complicating factor is the non-specific nature of electrical nerve stimulation. Optogenetic tools enable high specificity in neural stimulation using cell-type specific targeting of opsins and/or spatially shaped excitation light. Here, we demonstrate light-activated stimulation of the endocrine pancreas by targeting vagal parasympathetic axons. In a mouse model expressing ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2) in cholinergic cells, serum insulin and glucose were measured in response to both ultrasound image-guided optical stimulation of axon terminals in the pancreas and optical stimulation of axons of the cervical vagus nerve, together with ultrasound-based measures of pancreas blood flow. Measurements were made in basal-glucose and glucose-stimulated conditions. Significant increases in plasma insulin occurred relative to controls under both pancreas and vagal stimulation, accompanying rapid reductions in glycemic levels. Additionally, a significant increase in pancreatic blood flow was measured following optical stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of in-vivo optogenetics for studying the neural regulation of endocrine pancreas function and suggest therapeutic potential for the control of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.",

Single-cell profiling methods enable the investigation of cell population distributions and transcriptional changes along the airways.\n\nMethodsWe have explored cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected by bronchoscopy at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree.\n\nResultsThe resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1%), but also immune (6.2%) and stromal (4.7%) cells with peculiar cellular proportions in different sites of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression was stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuro-endocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, which are likely derived from a common population of precursor cells. We also report a population of KRT13 positive cells with a high percentage of dividing cells which are reminiscent of \"hillock\" cells previously described in mouse.\n\nConclusionsRobust characterization of this unprecedented large single-cell cohort establishes an important resource for future investigations. The precise description of the continuum existing from nasal epithelium to successive divisions of lung airways and the stable gene expression profile of these regions better defines conditions under which relevant tracheobronchial proxies of human respiratory diseases can be developed.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are critical to protein function, but three-dimensional (3D) arrangements of interacting proteins have proven hard to predict, even given the identities and 3D structures of the interacting partners. Specifically, identifying the relevant pairwise interaction surfaces remains difficult, often relying on shape complementarity with molecular docking while accounting for molecular motions to optimize rigid 3D translations and rotations. However, such approaches can be computationally expensive, and faster, less accurate approximations may prove useful for large-scale prediction and assembly of 3D structures of multi-protein complexes. We asked if a reduced representation of protein geometry retains enough information about molecular properties to predict pairwise protein interaction interfaces that are tolerant of limited structural rearrangements. Here, we describe a cuboid transformation of 3D protein accessible surfaces on which molecular properties such as charge, hydrophobicity, and mutation rate can be easily mapped, implemented in the MorphProt package. Pairs of surfaces are compared to rapidly assess partner-specific potential surface complementarity. On two available benchmarks of 85 overall known protein complexes, we observed F1 scores (a weighted combination of precision and recall) of 19-34% at correctly identifying protein interaction surfaces, comparable to more computationally intensive 3D docking methods in the annual Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions. Furthermore, we examined the effect of molecular motion through normal mode simulation on a benchmark receptor-ligand pair and observed no marked loss of predictive accuracy for distortions of up to 6 [A] RMSD. Thus, a cuboid transformation of protein surfaces retains considerable information about surface complementarity, offers enhanced speed of comparison relative to more complex geometric representations, and exhibits tolerance to conformational changes.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 100,000 years, humans have spread across the globe and encountered a highly diverse set of environments to which they have had to adapt. Genome-wide scans of selection are powerful to detect selective sweeps. However, because of unknown fractions of undetected sweeps and false discoveries, the numbers of detected sweeps often poorly reflect actual numbers of selective sweeps in populations. The thousands of soft sweeps on standing variation recently evidenced in humans have also been interpreted as a majority of mis-classified neutral regions. In such a context, the extent of human adaptation remains little understood. We present a new rationale to estimate these actual numbers of sweeps expected over the last 100,000 years (denoted by X) from genome-wide population data, both considering hard sweeps and selective sweeps on standing variation. We implemented an approximate Bayesian computation framework and showed, based on computer simulations, that such a method can properly estimate X. We then jointly estimated the number of selective sweeps, their mean intensity and age in several 1000G African, European and Asian populations. Our estimations of X, found weakly sensitive to demographic misspecifications, revealed very limited numbers of sweeps regardless the frequency of the selected alleles at the onset of selection and the completion of sweeps. We estimated [~]80 sweeps in average across fifteen 1000G populations when assuming incomplete sweeps only and [~]140 selective sweeps in non-African populations when incorporating complete sweeps in our simulations. The method proposed may help to address controversies on the number of selective sweeps in populations, guiding further genome-wide investigations of recent positive selection.",

    "abstract": "DNA associated proteins (DAPs) classically regulate gene expression by binding to regulatory loci such as enhancers or promoters. As expanding catalogs of genome-wide DAP binding maps reveal thousands of loci that, unlike the majority of conventional enhancers and promoters, associate with dozens of different DAPs with apparently little regard for motif preference, an understanding of DAP association and coordination at such regulatory loci is essential to deciphering how these regions contribute to normal development and disease. In this study, we aggregated publicly available ChIP-seq data from 469 human DAPs assayed in three cell lines and integrated these data with an orthogonal dataset of 352 non-redundant, in vitro-derived motifs mapped to the genome within DNase hypersensitivity footprints in an effort to characterize regions of the genome that have exceptionally high numbers of DAP associations. We subsequently performed a massively parallel mutagenesis assay to search for sequence elements driving transcriptional activity at such loci and explored plausible biological mechanisms underlying their formation. We establish a generalizable definition for High Occupancy Target (HOT) loci and identify putative driver DAP motifs in HEPG2 cells, including HNF4A, SP1, SP5, and ETV4, that are highly prevalent and exhibit sequence conservation at HOT loci. The number of different DAPs associated with an element is positively associated with evidence of regulatory activity and, by systematically mutating 245 HOT loci, we localized regulatory activity to a central core region that depends on the motif sequences of our previously nominated driver DAPs. In sum, this work leverages the increasingly large number of DAP motif and ChIP-seq data publicly available to explore how DAP associations contribute to genome-wide transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "With the recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, estimation of allele expression from single cells is becoming increasingly reliable. Allele expression is both quantitative and dynamic and is an essential component of the genomic interactome. Here, we systematically estimate allele expression from heterozygous single nucleotide variant (SNV) loci using scRNA-seq data generated on the 10x Genomics platform. We include in the analysis 26,640 human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (from three healthy donors), with an average sequencing reads over 120K/cell (more than 4 billion scRNA-seq reads total). High quality SNV calls assessed in our study contained approximately 15% exonic and >50% intronic loci. To analyze the allele expression, we estimate the expressed Variant Allele Fraction (VAFRNA) from SNV-aware alignments and analyze its variance and distribution (mono- and bi-allelic) at different cutoffs for required minimal number of sequencing reads. Our analysis shows that when assessing SNV loci covered by a minimum of 3 unique sequencing reads, over 50% of the heterozygous SNVs show bi-allelic expression, while at minimum of 10 reads, nearly 90% of the SNVs are bi-allelic. Consistent with single cell studies on RNA velocity and models of transcriptional burst kinetics, we observe a substantially higher rate of monoallelic expression among intronic SNVs, signifying the usefulness of scVAFRNA to assess dynamic cellular processes. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of scVAFRNA estimation from current scRNA-seq datasets and shows that the 3-based library generation protocol of 10x Genomics scRNA-seq data can be highly informative in SNV-based analyses.",

One poorly understood, but important, area in virus-host interaction is the extensive remodelling of intracellular organelles and morphology that occurs during active viral replication. We have constructed a recombinant reporter virus that allowed us to classify four distinct stages in the infection cycle of herpes simplex virus 1. Single-cell analysis of the impact of the viral load on replication dynamics demonstrates the utility of this times-tamping method for tracking the infection cycle. High-resolution microscopy analysis of cellular structures in live and fixed cells in concert with our dual-fluorescent reporter virus have enabled us to generate a detailed overview over the spatial and temporal organisation of the cytoskeleton and organelles during viral replication.

    "abstract": "This research determined the concentration of trehalose, xylose and L-citrulline in fresh and fermented cucumbers and their utilization by Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus buchneri. Targeted compounds were measured by HPLC and the ability of certain lactobacilli to utilize them was scrutinized in fermented cucumber juice. Fresh cucumber juice was supplemented with trehalose, xylose and L-citrulline to observed mixed culture fermentations. Changes in the biochemistry, pH and colony counts during fermentations were monitored. Trehalose was detected in fermentations to 15.51 {+/-} 1.68 mM. Xylose was found in a fresh cucumber sample to 36.05 mM. L-citrulline was present in fresh and fermented cucumber samples to 1.05 {+/-} 0.63 mM. Most of the lactobacilli tested utilized trehalose and xylose in FCJM at pH 4.7. L-citrulline was utilized by L. buchneri and produced by other LAB. L-citrulline (12.43 {+/-} 2.3 mM) was converted to ammonia (14.54 {+/-} 3.60 mM) and the biogenic amine ornithine (14.19 {+/-} 1.07 mM) by L. buchneri at pH 4.7 in the presence of 0.5 {+/-} 0.2 mM glucose enhancing growth by 0.5 log CFU/mL. The use of a mixed starter culture containing L. buchneri aided in the removal of L-citrulline and enhanced the fermentation stability. The utilization of L-citrulline by L. buchneri may be a cause of concern for the stability of cucumber fermentations at pH 3.7 or above. This study identifies the use of a tripartite starter culture as an enhancer of microbial stability for fermented cucumbers.\n\nImportanceUtilization of trehalose, xylose and L-citrulline as energy sources by the indigenous cucumber microbiota was studied to determine if this was a cause for the spoilage of the fermented fruit. While the plant derived sugars, trehalose and xylose, were occasionally present in cucumber fermentations, they are readily utilized by the bacteria spearheading primary fermentation. L-citrulline, however, is an amino acid not naturally found in proteins, was detected in all the samples tested and was uniquely utilized by the spoilage associated bacterium, L. buchneri. Additionally, the bacteria involved in cucumber fermentation produced L-citrulline. It was observed that the use of L. pentosus, L. brevis and L. buchneri in a mixed starter culture aids in the removal of the alternate energy sources, including L-citrulline, and the generation of a stable cucumber fermentation for 55 days under anaerobiosis.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) and play a central role in decoding our genome, yet their expression and non-canonical function remain understudied. Many DNA tumor viruses enhance the activity of RNAPIII, yet whether infection alters tRNA expression is largely unknown. Here, we present the first genome-wide analysis of how viral infection alters the tRNAome. Using a tRNA-specific sequencing method (DM-tRNA-seq), we find that the murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 induces global changes in pre-tRNA expression with 14% of tRNA genes upregulated more than 3-fold, indicating that differential tRNA gene induction is a characteristic of DNA virus infection. Elevated pre-tRNA expression corresponds to increased RNAPIII occupancy for the subset of tRNA genes tested; additionally, post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the accumulation of pre-tRNA species. We find increased abundance of tRNA fragments derived from pre-tRNAs upregulated by viral infection, suggesting that non-canonical tRNA cleavage is also affected. Further, pre-tRNA accumulation, but not RNAPIII recruitment, requires gammaherpesvirus-induced degradation of host mRNAs by the virally encoded mRNA endonuclease muSOX. We hypothesize that depletion of pre-tRNA maturation or turnover machinery contributes to robust accumulation of full-length pre-tRNAs in infected cells. Collectively, these findings reveal pervasive changes to tRNA expression during DNA virus infection and highlight the potential of using viruses to explore tRNA biology.\n\nSignificanceViral infection can dramatically change the gene expression landscape of the host cell, yet little is known regarding changes in non-coding gene transcription by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII). Among these are transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are fundamental in protein translation, yet whose gene regulatory features remain largely undefined in mammalian cells. Here, we perform the first genome-wide analysis of tRNA expression changes during viral infection. We show that premature tRNAs accumulate during infection with the model gammaherpesvirus MHV68 as a consequence of increased transcription, but that transcripts do not undergo canonical maturation into mature tRNAs. These findings underscore how tRNA expression is a highly-regulated process and that cells have strategies to balance tRNA pools during conditions of elevated RNAPIII activity.",

In an increasing number of studies, researchers have identified GBH residues in soil, water, crops, and food products exposing non-target organisms to health risks; these organisms include wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, GBH-related parental effects are poorly understood. In the case of birds, GBHs may be transferred directly from mother to developing offspring (i.e. direct effects) via eggs, or they may indirectly influence offspring performance by altered maternal condition or resource allocation to eggs, for example. We experimentally exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs or respective controls, recorded egg quality and glyphosate residues in eggs, and studied embryonic development and oxidative biomarkers. Glyphosate accumulated in eggs (ca 0.76 kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be lower in eggs of GBH-exposed parents compared to control parents. Embryonic brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid damage. Given that we detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or shell mass, or egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups, our results suggest these are likely direct effects of GBHs on offspring rather than indirect effects via altered maternal allocation of resources or hormonal signals.\n\nCapsuleExperimental, long-term parental exposure to GBHs tends to hinder offspring embryonic development and increase embryonic oxidative damage to lipids in a bird model.",

    "abstract": "The native plant microbiome is composed of diverse communities that influence its overall health, with some species known to promote plant growth and pathogen resistance. Here, we show the antimicrobial and growth promoting activities of autoclaved culture metabolites (ACMs) from native endophytic bacteria (NEB) in a papaya cultivar that is tolerant to bacterial crown rot (BCR) caused by Erwinia mallotivora. Initially, bacterial colonization in recovering tissues of this cultivar was observed before onset of tissue regeneration or  regrowth. We further isolated and characterized these bacteria and were able to identify two culturable stem NEB under genera Kosakonia (EBW), related to Enterobacter, and Sphingomonas (EBY). We also identified root NEB (BN, BS and BT) under genus Bacillus. Inhibition assays indicated that ACMs from these NEB promptly (18-30h) and efficiently inhibited (60-65%) E. mallotivora proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, when ACMs from BN and EBW were inoculated in surface-sterilized papaya seeds, germination was variably retarded (20-60% reduction) depending on plant genotype, but plant biomass accumulation was significantly stimulated, at around two-fold increase. Moreover, greenhouse experiments show that ACMs from all isolates, especially EBW, significantly reduced BCR incidence and severity in susceptible genotype, at around two-fold. In general, our observations of pathogen antagonism, plant growth promotion leading to disease reduction by ACMs of native endophytic bacteria suggested its contribution to increased fitness of papaya and tolerance against the (re)emerging BCR disease.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular spatial heterogeneity is frequently observed in bacteria, where the chromosome occupies part of the cell\u2019s volume and a circuit\u2019s DNA often localizes within the cell. How this heterogeneity affects core processes and genetic circuits is still poorly understood. In fact, commonly used ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of genetic circuits assume a well-mixed ensemble of molecules and, as such, do not capture spatial aspects. Reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) models have been only occasionally used since they are difficult to integrate and do not provide mechanistic understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we derive a reduced ODE model that captures spatial effects, yet has the same dimension as commonly used well-mixed models. In particular, the only difference with respect to a well-mixed ODE model is that the association rate constant of binding reactions is multiplied by a coefficient, which we refer to as the binding correction factor (BCF). The BCF depends on the size of interacting molecules and on their location when fixed in space and it is equal to unity in a well-mixed ODE model. The BCF can be used to investigate how spatial heterogeneity affects the behavior of core processes and genetic circuits. Specifically, our reduced model indicates that transcription and its regulation are more effective for genes located at the cell poles than for genes located on the chromosome. The extent of these effects depends on the value of the BCF, which we found to be close to unity. For translation, the value of the BCF is always greater than unity, it increases with mRNA size, and, with biologically relevant parameters, is substantially larger than unity. Our model has broad validity, has the same dimension as a well-mixed model, yet it incorporates spatial heterogeneity. This simple-to-use model can be used to both analyze and design genetic circuits while accounting for spatial intracellular effects.HighlightsIntracellular spatial heterogeneity modulates the effective association rate constant of binding reactions through a binding correction factor (BCF) that fully captures spatial effectsThe BCF depends on molecules size and location (if fixed) and can be determined experimentallySpatial heterogeneity may be detrimental or exploited for genetic circuit designTraditional well-mixed models can be appropriate despite spatial heterogeneityStatement of significance A general and simple modeling framework to determine how spatial heterogeneity modulates the dynamics of gene networks is currently lacking. To this end, this work provides a simple-to-use ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that can be used to both analyze and design genetic circuits while accounting for spatial intracellular effects. We apply our model to several core biological processes and determine that transcription and its regulation are more effective for genes located at the cell poles than for genes located on the chromosome and this difference increases with regulator size. For translation, we predict the effective binding between ribosomes and mRNA is higher than that predicted by a well-mixed model, and it increases with mRNA size. We provide examples where spatial effects are significant and should be considered but also where a traditional well-mixed model suffices despite severe spatial heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrate how the operation of well-known genetic circuits is impacted by spatial effects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a pipeline of massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provided large-scale datasets to investigate biological mechanisms in detail. However, bigger data often leads to larger complexity. As a result, theories derived from low-throughput experiments lose explanatory power, requiring new methods to create predictive models. Here we focus on modeling functions of nucleic acid sequences, as a study case of massive-throughput assays. We report a deep learning approach, training a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) on an ordered graph representation of nucleic acid sequences to predict their functions (Seq2DFunc). To compare the performance of Seq2DFunc with conventional methods, we obtained customized database on a CRISPR RNA processing assay. For this specific assay, analyses of sequence and RNA structure determinants failed to explain the results regardless of dataset size. 1-dimensional CNN of raw sequences generate generally failed to converge at < 10,000 or fewer sequences. By contrast, Seq2DFunc trained on [~] 7,000 sequences still provided 86% accuracy. Given a sufficient dataset ([~] 120,000 sequences) for training, Seq2DFunc (96% accuracy, 0.93 f1-score) still outperformed the best 1D CNN (92% accuracy, 0.83 f1-score). We anticipate Seq2DFunc can be a versatile downstream tool for deciphering massive-throughput assays for many fundamental studies. In addition, the use of smaller dataset is especially beneficial to reduce the experiment budget or required sequencing depth.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of decision makings in a cell in response to received signals is of high importance for understanding how cell fate is determined. The problem becomes multi-faceted and complex when we consider cellular heterogeneity and dynamics of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a unified set of decision-theoretic and statistical signal processing methods and metrics to model the precision of signaling decisions, given uncertainty, using single cell data. First, we introduce erroneous decisions that may result from signaling processes, and identify false alarm and miss event that are associated with such decisions. Then, we present an optimal decision strategy which minimizes the total decision error probability. The optimal decision threshold or boundary is determined using the maximum likelihood principle that chooses the hypothesis under which the data are most probable. Additionally, we demonstrate how graphing receiver operating characteristic curve conveniently reveals the trade-off between false alarm and miss probabilities associated with different cell responses. Furthermore, we extend the introduced signaling outcome modeling framework to incorporate the dynamics of biochemical processes and reactions in a cell, using multi-time point measurements and multi-dimensional outcome analysis and decision making algorithms. The introduced multivariate signaling outcome modeling framework can be used to analyze several molecular species measured at the same or different time instants. We also show how the developed binary outcome analysis and decision making approach can be extended to include more than two possible outcomes. To show how the overall set of introduced models and methods can be used in practice and as an example, we apply them to single cell data of an intracellular regulatory molecule called Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) in a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal, e.g., mutant cells. These molecules are involved in tumor suppression, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The unified signaling outcome modeling framework presented here can be applied to various organisms ranging from simple ones such as viruses, bacteria, yeast, and lower metazoans, to more complex organisms such as mammalian cells. Ultimately, this signaling outcome modeling approach can be useful for better understanding of transition from physiological to pathological conditions such as inflammation, various cancers and autoimmune diseases.\n\nBrief SummaryCells are supposed to make correct decisions, i.e., respond properly to various signals and initiate certain cellular functions, based on the signals they receive from the surrounding environment. Due to signal transduction noise, signaling malfunctions or other factors, cells may respond differently to the same input signals, which may result in incorrect cell decisions. Modeling and quantification of decision making processes and signaling outcomes in cells have emerged as important research areas in recent years. Here we present univariate and multivariate data-driven statistical models and methods for analyzing dynamic decision making processes and signaling outcomes. Furthermore, we exemplify the methods using single cell data generated by a p53 system, in wild-type and abnormal cells.",

    "abstract": "Networks have been established as an extremely powerful framework to understand and predict the behavior of many large-scale complex systems. We have studied network motifs, the basic structural elements of networks, to describe the possible role of co-occurrence of genomic variations behind high altitude adaptation in the Asian human population. Mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) variations have been acclaimed as one of the key players in understanding the biological mechanisms behind adaptation to extreme conditions. To explore the cumulative effects and variations in the mitochondrial genome with the variation in the altitude, we investigated human mt-DNA sequences from the NCBI database at different altitudes under the co-occurrence motifs framework. Analysis of the co-occurrence motifs using similarity clusteringrevealed a clear distinction between lower and higher altitude regions. In addition, the previously known high altitude markers 3394 and 7697 (which are definitive sites of haplogroup M9a1a1c1b) were found to co-occur within their own gene complexes indicating the impact of intra-genic constraint on co-evolution of nucleotides. Furthermore, an ancestral  RSRS50 variant 10398 was found to co-occur only at higher altitudes supporting the fact that a separate route of colonization at these altitudes might have taken place. Overall, our analysis revealed the presence of co-occurrence interactions specific to high altitude at a whole mitochondrial genome level. This study, combined with the classical haplogroups analysis is useful in understanding the role of co-occurrence of mitochondrial variations in high altitude adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Most emerging pathogens can infect multiple species, underscoring the importance of understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that allow some hosts to harbor greater infection prevalence and share pathogens with other species. However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare--but detectable--bacterial sharing between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts for not only viruses but also bacteria. Such work more broadly contributes to increasing efforts to understand cross-species transmission and epidemiological consequences of bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlastid gene loss and pseudogenization has been widely documented in parasitic and mycoheterotrophic plants, which have relaxed selective constraints on photosynthetic function. More enigmatic are sporadic reports of degradation and loss of important photosynthesis genes in lineages thought to be fully photosynthetic. Here we report the complete plastid genome of Saniculiphyllum guangxiense, a critically endangered and phylogenetically isolated plant lineage, along with genomic evidence of reduced chloroplast function. We also report 22 additional plastid genomes representing the diversity of its containing clade Saxifragales, characterizing gene content and placing variation in a broader phylogenetic context.\n\nResultsWe find that the plastid genome of Saniculiphyllum has experienced pseudogenization of five genes of the NDH complex (ndhA, ndhB, ndhD, ndhF, and ndhK), previously reported in flowering plants with an aquatic habit, as well as the more surprising pseudogenization of two genes more central to photosynthesis (ccsA and cemA), contrasting with strong phylogenetic conservatism of plastid gene content in all other sampled Saxifragales. These genes participate in photooxidative protection, cytochrome synthesis, and carbon uptake. Nuclear paralogs exist for all seven plastid pseudogenes, yet these are also unlikely to be functional.\n\nConclusionsSaniculiphyllum appears to represent the greatest degree of plastid gene loss observed to date in any fully photosynthetic lineage, yet plastid genome length, structure, and substitution rate are within the variation previously reported for photosynthetic plants. These results highlight the increasingly appreciated dynamism of plastid genomes, otherwise highly conserved across a billion years of green plant evolution, in plants with highly specialized life history traits.",

Studies in mammalian models have shown that Ado regulates signaling mechanisms involved in  danger-sensing and tissue-protection. Yet, little is known about the role of Ado signaling in Drosophila. In the present study, we observed lower extracellular Ado concentration and suppressed expression of Ado transporters in flies expressing mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). We altered Ado signaling using genetic tools and found that the overexpression of Ado metabolic enzymes, as well as the suppression of Ado receptor (AdoR) and transporters (ENTs), were able to minimize mHTT-induced mortality. We also identified the downstream targets of the AdoR pathway, the modifier of mdg4 (Mod(mdg4)) and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), which carry out its function. Finally, we showed that a decrease in Ado signaling affect other Drosophila stress reactions, including paraquat and heat-shock treatments. Our study provides important insights into how Ado regulates stress responses in Drosophila.",

Paradoxically, deficiency in TNF (TNF-/-) also caused significant pathology during respiratory ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection, a surrogate mouse model for smallpox. TNF-/- mice succumbed to fulminant disease whereas wild-type mice, and those expressing only transmembrane TNF, recovered. TNF deficiency did not affect viral load or leukocyte recruitment but caused severe lung pathology and excessive production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-10, TGF-{beta}, and IFN-{gamma}. Blockade of these cytokines reduced lung pathology concomitant with induction of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) and/or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), factors that inhibit STAT3 activation. Short-term inhibition of STAT3 activation in ECTV-infected TNF-/- mice with an inhibitor reduced lung pathology. TNF is essential for regulating inflammation and its deficiency exacerbates ECTV infection as a consequence of significant lung pathology caused by dysregulation of inflammatory cytokine production, in part via overactivation of STAT3.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated cleavage is involved in numerous essential cellular pathways. miRNAs recognize target RNAs via sequence complementarity. In addition to complementarity, in vitro and in silico studies have suggested that RNA structure may influence the accessibility of mRNAs to miRNA-Induced Silencing Complexes (miRISCs), thereby affecting RNA silencing. However, the regulatory mechanism of mRNA structure in miRNA cleavage remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of in vivo RNA secondary structure in miRNA cleavage by developing the new CAP-STRUCTURE-seq method to capture the intact mRNA structurome in Arabidopsis thaliana. This approach revealed that miRNA target sites were not structurally accessible for miRISC binding prior to cleavage in vivo. Instead, the unfolding of the target site structure is the primary determinant for miRISC activity in vivo. Notably, we found that the single-strandedness of the two nucleotides immediately downstream of the target site, named Target Adjacent structure Motif (TAM), can promote miRNA cleavage but not miRNA binding, thus decoupling target site binding from cleavage. Our findings demonstrate that mRNA structure in vivo can regulate miRNA cleavage, providing evidence of mRNA structure-dependent regulation of biological processes.",

Here we reveal that the ubiquitously expressed PHD-finger protein OBE3 forms a central module with the phloem- specific SMXL5 protein for establishing phloem identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. By protein interaction studies and phloem-specific ATAC-seq analyses, we show that OBE3 and SMXL5 proteins form a complex in nuclei of phloem stem cells where they establish a phloem-specific chromatin profile. This profile allows expression of OPS, BRX, BAM3, and CVP2 genes acting as mediators of phloem differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that OBE3/SMXL5 protein complexes establish nuclear features essential for determining phloem cell fate and highlight how a combination of ubiquitous and local regulators generate specificity of developmental decisions in plants.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein ZC3H14 result in a non-syndromic form of autosomal recessive intellectual disability. Studies in Drosophila have defined roles for the ZC3H14 ortholog, Nab2 (aka Drosophila Nab2 or dNab2), in axon guidance and memory due in part to interaction with a second RNA-binding protein, the fly Fragile X homolog Fmr1, and coregulation of shared Nab2-Fmr1 target mRNAs. Despite these advances, neurodevelopmental pathways regulated by Nab2 remain poorly defined. Structural defects in Nab2 null brains resemble defects observed upon disruption of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which regulates planar orientation of static and motile cells. A kinked bristle phenotype in surviving Nab2 mutant adults additionally suggests a defect in F-actin polymerization and bundling, which is also a PCP-regulated processes. To test for Nab2-PCP genetic interactions, a collection of PCP loss-of-function alleles was screened for modification of a rough-eye phenotype produced by Nab2 overexpression in the eye (GMR-Nab2) and subsequently for modification of Nab2 null phenotypes. Multiple PCP alleles dominantly modify GMR-Nab2 eye roughening and a subset of these alleles also rescue low survival and thoracic bristle kinking in Nab2 zygotic nulls. Moreover, alleles of two X-linked PCP factors, dishevelled (dsh) and {beta} amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl), rescue GMR-Nab2 eye roughening in male progeny derived from hemizygous dsh or Appl mutant fathers, suggesting an additional effect inherited through the male germline. These findings demonstrate a consistent pattern of Nab2-PCP genetic interactions that suggest molecular links between Nab2 and the PCP pathway in the developing eye, wing and germline.",

    "abstract": "Tomato steroidal glycoalkaloids (tSGAs) are a class of cholesterol-derived metabolites uniquely produced by the tomato clade. These compounds provide protection against biotic stress due to their fungicidal and insecticidal properties. Although commonly reported as being anti-nutritional, both in vitro as well as pre-clinical animal studies have indicated that some tSGAs may have a beneficial impact on human health. However, the paucity of quantitative extraction and analysis methods presents a major obstacle for determining the biological and nutritional functions of tSGAs. To address this problem, we developed and validated the first comprehensive extraction and UHPLC-MS/MS quantification method for tSGAs. Our extraction method allows for up to 16 samples to be extracted simultaneously in 20 minutes with 93.0 {+/-} 6.8% and 100.8 {+/-} 13.1% recovery rates for tomatidine and alpha-tomatine, respectively. Our ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was able to chromatographically separate analytes derived from 16 tSGAs representing 9 different tSGA masses, as well as two internal standards, in 13 minutes. Tomato steroidal glycoalkaloids that did not have available standards were annotated using high resolution mass spectrometry as well as product ion scans that provided fragmentation data. Lastly, we utilized our method to survey a variety of commonly consumed tomato-based products. Total tSGA concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 3.4 mg/serving and represent some of the first reported tSGA concentrations in tomato-based products. Our validation studies indicate that our method is sensitive, robust, and able to be used for a variety of applications where concentrations of biologically relevant tSGAs need to be quantified.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsLiver fibrosis develops in the context of excessive oxidative stress, cell death and accumulation of myofibroblasts (MFs) derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that can be caused by inhibiting the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT. However, while xCT is induced in various liver diseases, its role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that xCT is required for HSCs to antagonize ferroptosis and remain myofibroblastic.\n\nMethodsxCT activity was disrupted by siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors in MF-HSC cell lines to determine its effect on redox homeostasis, growth, myofibroblastic activity and viability. xCT expression was then determined by RNA sequencing and RT-PCR during primary HSC activation, and its role in HSC trans-differentiation was assessed. For comparison, xCT expression and function were also determined in primary hepatocytes. Finally, the roles of xCT in HSC accumulation and liver fibrosis were assessed in mice treated acutely with CCl4.\n\nResultsInhibiting xCT in MF-HSCs decreased intracellular glutathione (GSH), suppressed growth and fibrogenesis, and induced cell death. These effects were rescued by antioxidants, an iron chelator, and a canonical ferroptosis inhibitor, but not by inhibitors of apoptosis or necrosis. xCT was dramatically up-regulated during primary HSC activation, and inhibiting xCT suppressed myofibroblastic trans-differentiation and induced ferroptosis. In contrast, healthy hepatocytes were relatively insensitive to ferroptosis induced by xCT inhibition. In vivo, inhibiting xCT systemically reduced MF-HSC accumulation and liver fibrosis after a single dose of CCl4 without exacerbating liver injury or reducing hepatocyte regeneration.\n\nConclusionCompared to healthy hepatocytes, MF-HSCs are exquisitely sensitive to ferroptosis induced by inhibiting xCT. In acutely injured livers, systemic inhibitors of xCT can inhibit fibrosis without worsening liver injury. Further research is needed to determine if this therapeutic window remains sufficiently robust to safely target MF-HSCs and inhibit fibrogenesis in chronically injured liver.",

Previous studies in the Csf1r+/- mouse model of ALSP hypothesized a central role of elevated cerebral Csf2 expression. Here we show that monoallelic deletion of Csf2 rescues most behavioral deficits and histopathological changes in Csf1r+/- mice by preventing microgliosis and eliminating most microglial transcriptomic alterations, including those indicative of oxidative stress and demyelination. We also show elevation of Csf2 transcripts and of several CSF-2 downstream targets in the brains of ALSP patients, demonstrating that the mechanisms identified in the mouse model are functional in man. Our data provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ALSP.

    "abstract": "MotivationLow back pain is responsible for more global disability than any other condition. Its incidence is closely related to intervertebral disc (IVD) failure, which is likely caused by an accumulation of microtrauma within the IVD. Crucial factors in microtrauma development are not entirely known yet, probably because their exploration in vivo or in vitro remains tremendously challenging. In-silico modelling is, therefore, definitively appealing, and shall include approaches to integrate influences of multiple cell stimuli at the microscale. Accordingly, this study introduces a hybrid Agent-based (AB) model in IVD research and exploits network modelling solutions in systems biology to mimic the cellular behavior of Nucleus Pulposus cells exposed to a 3D multifactorial biochemical environment, based on mathematical integrations of existing experimental knowledge. Cellular activity reflected by mRNA expression of Aggrecan, Collagen type I, Collagen type II, MMP-3 and ADAMTS were calculated for inflamed and non-inflamed cells. mRNA expression over long periods of time is additionally determined including cell viability estimations. Model predictions were eventually validated with independent experimental data.\n\nResultsAs it combines experimental data to simulate cell behavior exposed to a multifactorial environment, the present methodology was able to reproduce cell death within 3 days under glucose deprivation and a 50% decrease in cell viability after 7 days in an acidic environment. Cellular mRNA expression under non-inflamed conditions simulated a quantifiable catabolic shift under an adverse cell environment, and model predictions of mRNA expression of inflamed cells provide new explanation possibilities for unexpected results achieved in experimental research.\n\nContactlaura.baumgartner@upf.edu",

    "abstract": "A main assumption of molecular population genetics is that genomic mutation rate does not depend on sequence function. Challenging this assumption, a recent study has found a reduction in the mutation rate in exons compared to introns in somatic cells. This reduction was ascribed to an enhanced exonic mismatch repair system activity. If this reduction happens also in the germline, it can compromise studies of population genomics, including the detection of the footprint of selection when using introns as proxies of neutrality. Here we compiled and analyzed published germline de novo mutation (DNM) data to test if the exonic mutation rate is also reduced in germ cells. We detected ascertainment bias in studies using DNM data from diseased probands and investigated the impact of extended nucleotide context on de novo mutation rate. After controlling for these factors, we found no reduction in the mutation rate in exons compared to introns in the germline genome, in contrast to what has been previously described in somatic cells. Therefore, there is no evidence of an enhanced mismatch repair system activity in exons with respect to adjacent introns in germline cells.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation carried out in legume root nodules requires transition metals. These nutrients are delivered by the host plant to the endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria living with the nodule cells, a process in which vascular transport is essential. As occurs in root-to-shoot transport, members of the Yellow Stripe-Like (YSL) family of metal transporters should also be required for root-to-nodule metal delivery. The genome of the model legume Medicago truncatula encodes for eight YSL proteins, four of them with a high degree of similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana YSLs involved in long-distance metal trafficking. Among them, MtYSL3 is a plasma membrane protein expressed by vascular cells in roots and nodules, and by cortical nodule cells. Reducing expression levels of this gene had no major effect on plant physiology when assimilable nitrogen was provided in the nutrient solution. However, nodule functioning was severely impaired, with a significant reduction of nitrogen fixation capabilities. Further, iron and zinc accumulation and distribution changed. Iron was retained in the apical region of the nodule, while zinc became strongly accumulated in the nodule veins in the ysl3 mutant. These data suggest a role of MtYSL3 in vascular delivery of iron and zinc to symbiotic nitrogen fixation.\n\nHighlightMedicago truncatula YSL3 transporter is required for optimal nitrogen fixation in root nodules, mediating iron and zinc distribution in these organs.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with metaplastic changes in the pancreas but the transcriptional program underlying these changes is incompletely understood. The zinc finger transcription factor, PRDM3, is lowly expressed in normal pancreatic acini and its expression increases during tumorigenesis. Although PRDM3 promotes proliferation and migration of PDAC cell lines, the role of PRDM3 during tumor initiation from pancreatic acinar cells in vivo is unclear. In this study, we showed that high levels of PRDM3 expression in human pancreas was associated with pancreatitis, and well-differentiated but not poorly differentiated carcinoma. We examined PRDM3 function in pancreatic acinar cells during tumor formation and pancreatitis by inactivating Prdm3 using a conditional allele (Ptf1aCreER;Prdm3flox/floxmice) in the context of oncogenic Kras expression and supraphysiological cerulein injections, respectively. In Prdm3-deficient mice, KrasG12D-driven preneoplastic lesions were more abundant and progressed to high-grade precancerous lesions more rapidly. This is consistent with our observations that low levels of PRDM3 in human PDAC was correlated significantly with poorer survival in patient. Moreover, loss of Prdm3 in acinar cells elevated exocrine injury, enhanced immune cell activation and infiltration, and greatly increased acinar-to-ductal cell reprogramming upon cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Whole transcriptome analyses of Prdm3 knockout acini revealed that pathways involved in inflammatory response and Hif-1 signaling were significantly upregulated in Prdm3-depleted acinar cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Prdm3 favors the maintenance of acinar cell homeostasis through modulation of their response to inflammation and oncogenic Kras activation, and thus plays a previously unexpected suppressive role during PDAC initiation.",

    "abstract": "Several methods have been developed for inferring gene-gene interactions from expression data. To date, these methods mainly focused on intra-cellular interactions. The availability of high throughput spatial expression data opens the door to methods that can infer such interactions both within and between cells. However, the spatial data also raises several new challenges. These include issues related to the sparse, noisy expression vectors for each cell, the fact that several different cell types are often profiled, the definition of a neighborhood of cell and the relatively small number of extracellular interactions. To enable the identification of gene interactions between cells we extended a Graph Convolutional Neural network approach for Genes (GCNG). We encode the spatial information as a graph and use the network to combine it with the expression data using supervised training. Testing GCNG on spatial transcriptomics data we show that it improves upon prior methods suggested for this task and can propose novel pairs of extracellular interacting genes. Finally, we show that the output of GCNG can also be used for down-stream analysis including functional assignment.\n\nSupporting website with software and data: https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG.",

    "abstract": "Responding appropriately to challenges is an important contributor to fitness. Variation in the regulation of glucocorticoid hormones, which mediate the phenotypic response to challenges, can therefore influence the ability to persist in a given environment. We compared stress responsiveness in four populations of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) along an environmental gradient to evaluate support for different selective pressures in driving the evolution of glucocorticoid regulation. In accordance with the environmental unpredictability hypothesis, stronger stress responses were seen in more unpredictable environments. Contrary to the reproductive value hypothesis, the stress response was not lower in populations engaging in more valuable reproductive attempts. Populations with stronger stress responses also had stronger negative feedback, which supports a \"mitigating\" rather than a \"magnifying\" effect of negative feedback on stress responses. These results suggest that combining a robust stress response with strong negative feedback may be important for persisting in unpredictable or rapidly changing environments.",

Integrative functional genomics analysis for altered response to alcohol in mice provided the first evidence that multi-species analysis tools, such as GeneWeaver, can identify or confirm novel alcohol-related loci. The present study describes an integrative framework to investigate how highly-connected genes linked by their association to tobacco-related behaviors, contribute to individual differences in tobacco consumption. Data from individuals of European ancestry in the UKBiobank (N=139,043) were used to examine the relative contribution of orthologs of a set of genes that are transcriptionally co-regulated by tobacco or nicotine exposure in model organism experiments to human tobacco consumption. Multi-component mixed linear models using genotyped and imputed single nucleotide variants indicated that: (1) variation within human orthologs of these genes accounted for 2-5% of the observed heritability (meta h2SNP-Total=0.08 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.09]) of tobacco/nicotine consumption across three independent folds of unrelated individuals (enrichment ranging from 0.85 - 2.98), and (2) variation around (5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 Kb regions) the set of co-transcriptionally regulated genes accounted for 5-36% of the observed SNP-heritability (enrichment ranging from 1.60 - 31.45). Notably, the effects of variants in co-transcriptionally regulated genes were enriched in tobacco GWAS. These findings highlight the advantages of using multiple species evidence to isolate genetic factors to better understand the etiological complexity of tobacco and other nicotine consumption.",

    "abstract": "Real-time imaging of bacterial virulence factor dynamics is hampered by the limited number of fluorescent tools suitable for tagging secreted effectors. Here, we demonstrated that the fluorogenic reporter FAST could be used to tag secreted proteins, and we implemented it to monitor infection dynamics in epithelial cells exposed to the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). By tracking individual FAST-labelled vacuoles after Lm internalisation into cells, we unveiled the heterogeneity of residence time inside entry vacuoles. Although half of the bacterial population escaped within 13 minutes after entry, 12% of bacteria remained entrapped over an hour inside long term vacuoles, and sometimes much longer, regardless of the secretion of the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). We imaged LLO-FAST in these long-term vacuoles, and showed that LLO enabled Lm to proliferate inside these compartments, reminiscent of what had been previously observed for Spacious Listeria-containing phagosomes (SLAPs). Unexpectedly, inside epithelial SLAP-like vacuoles (eSLAPs), Lm proliferated as fast as in the host cytosol. eSLAPs thus constitute an alternative replication niche in epithelial cells that might promote the colonization of host tissues.\n\nAuthor summaryBacterial pathogens secrete virulence factors to subvert their hosts; however, monitoring bacterial secretion in real-time remains challenging. Here, we developed a convenient method that enabled fluorescent imaging of secreted proteins in live microscopy, and applied it to the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria has been described to invade cells and proliferate in their cytosol; it is first internalized inside vacuoles, from where it escapes thanks to the secretion of virulence factors that disrupt membranes. Our work revealed the existence, in human epithelial cells, of a population of Listeria that failed to escape vacuoles but instead multiplied efficiently therein, despite -and in fact, thanks to-- the active secretion of a toxin that permeates membranes. This intravacuolar niche may provide Listeria with an alternative strategy to colonize its host.",

The lateral habenula (LHb) is a key neuronal hub coordinating behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. Yet, how individual LHb neurons represent defensive behaviors in response to threats remains unknown. Here we show that, in mice, a visual threat promotes distinct defensive behaviors, namely runaway (escape) and action-locking (immobile-like). Fiber photometry of bulk LHb neuronal activity in behaving animals revealed an increase and decrease of calcium signal time-locked with runaway and action-locking, respectively. Imaging single-cell calcium dynamics across distinct threat-driven behaviors identified independently active LHb neuronal clusters. These clusters participate during specific time epochs of defensive behaviors. Decoding analysis of this neuronal activity unveiled that some LHb clusters either predict the upcoming selection of the defensive action or represent the selected action. Thus, heterogeneous neuronal clusters in LHb predict or reflect the selection of distinct threat-driven defensive behaviors.",

The E-field distribution depends on the conductivity geometry of the head. The effects of deviations from a spherically symmetric conductivity profile have been studied in detail in humans. In small mammals, such as rats, these effects are more pronounced due to their smaller and less spherical heads. In this study, we describe a simple method for building individual realistically shaped head models for rats from high-resolution X-ray tomography images. We computed the TMS-induced E-field with the boundary element method and assessed the effect of head-model simplifications on the estimated E-field. The deviations from spherical symmetry have large, non-trivial effects on the E-field distribution: in some cases, even the direction of the E-field in the cortex cannot be reliably predicted by the coil orientation unless these deviations are properly considered.",

    "abstract": "In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms excluding angiosperms, flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) catalyze light-dependent reduction of O2 to H2O. This alleviates electron pressure on the photosynthetic apparatus and protects it from photodamage. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, four FDP isoforms function as hetero-oligomers of Flv1 and Flv3 and/or Flv2 and Flv4. An alternative electron transport pathway mediated by the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH-1) also contributes to redox hemostasis and the photoprotection of photosynthesis. Four NDH-1 types haven been characterized in cyanobacteria: NDH-11 and NDH-12, which function in respiration; and NDH-13 and NDH-14, which function in CO2 uptake. All four types are involved in cyclic electron transport. Along with single FDP mutants ({Delta}flv1 and {Delta}flv3) and the double NDH-1 mutants ({Delta}d1d2, which is deficient in NDH-11,2 and {Delta}d3d4, which is deficient in NDH-13,4), we studied triple mutants lacking either one of Flv1 or Flv3, and NDH-11,2 or NDH-13,4. We show that the presence of either Flv1/3 or NDH-11,2, but not NDH-13,4, is indispensable for survival during changes in growth conditions from high CO2 /moderate light to low CO2 / high light. Our results suggest functional redundancy and crosstalk between FDPs and NDH-11,2 under the studied conditions, and demonstrate that the functions of FDPs and NDH-11,2 are dynamically coordinated for the efficient oxidation of PSI and for photoprotection under variable CO2 and light availability.\n\nOne sentence summaryFlavodiiron proteins and NDH-1 complex ensure survival of cyanobacterial cells by cooperatively safeguarding the photosynthetic apparatus against excessive reduction",

    "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop in animal feed and human nutrition, mainly for its rich protein and oil contents. The remarkable rise in soybean transcriptome studies over the past five years generated an enormous amount of RNA-seq data, encompassing various tissues, developmental conditions, and genotypes. In this study, we have collected data from 1,298 publicly available soybean transcriptome samples, processed the raw sequencing reads, and mapped them to the soybean reference genome in a systematic fashion. We found that 94% of the annotated genes (52,737/56,044) had detectable expression in at least one sample. Unsupervised clustering revealed three major groups, comprising samples from aerial, underground, and seed/seed-related parts. We found 452 genes with uniform and constant expression levels, supporting their roles as housekeeping genes. On the other hand, 1,349 genes showed heavily biased expression patterns towards particular tissues. A transcript-level analysis revealed that 95% (70,963/74,490) of the known transcripts overlap with those reported here, whereas 3,256 assembled transcripts represent potentially novel splicing isoforms. The dataset compiled here constitute a new resource for the community, which can be downloaded or accessed through a user-friendly web interface at http://venanciogroup.uenf.br/resources/. This comprehensive transcriptome atlas will likely accelerate research on soybean genetics and genomics.",

Polarization of macrophages determines their cellular function within biological processes. Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase in which its enzymatic activity contributes to macrophage pro-inflammatory responses. Lipin-1 also possesses transcriptional co-regulator activity and whether this activity is required for macrophage polarization is unknown. Using mice that lack only lipin-1 enzymatic activity or both enzymatic and transcriptional coregulator activities from myeloid cells, we investigated the contribution of lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulator function towards macrophage wound healing polarization. Macrophages lacking both lipin-1 activities did elicit IL-4 mediated gene expression to levels seen in either wild-type or lipin-1 enzymatically deficient macrophages. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the lack of myeloid-associated lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulator activity leads to impaired full thickness excisional wound healing. Our study demonstrates that lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulatory activity contributes to macrophage polarization and the macrophage contribution to wound healing in vivo.",

Honeybees artificial diet capable to stimulate the immune system is a promising field of investigation as ascertained by the introduction of 1,3-1,6 {beta}-glucans as a dietary supplement. In this work, by collecting faecal samples of honeybees exposed to different dietary conditions of 1,3-1,6 {beta}-glucans (0.5% and 2% w/w), it has been possible to investigate the DWV viral load kinetic without harming the insects. Virological data obtained by a one-step TaqMan RT-PCR highlights the ability of 1,3-1,6 {beta}-glucans to reduce the viral load at 24th day of rearing. Furthermore, results indicated that the diet supplemented with 1,3-1,6 {beta}-glucans was associated with a dose-dependent activation of phenoloxidase. Control group showed a higher survival rate than honeybees exposed to different dietary conditions of 1,3-1,6 {beta}-glucans while no differences have been observed concerning syrup daily consumption.",

Although emerging long-read technologies have enabled ETR assemblies, the accuracy of such assemblies is difficult to evaluate since there is no standard tool for their quality assessment. Moreover, since the mapping of long error-prone reads to ETR remains an open problem, it is not clear how to polish draft ETR assemblies. To address these problems, we developed the tandemMapper tool for mapping reads to ETRs and the tandemQUAST tool for polishing ETR assemblies and their quality assessment. We demonstrate that tandemQUAST not only reveals errors in and evaluates ETR assemblies, but also improves them. To illustrate how tandemMapper and tandemQUAST work, we apply them to recently generated assemblies of human centromeres.",

We propose a metric space on ranked genealogies for lineages sampled from both isochronous and time-stamped heterochronous sampling. Our new tree metrics make it possible to conduct statistical analyses of ranked tree shapes and timed ranked tree shapes, or ranked genealogies.

A comprehensive lipidomic analyses of primary myocytes from lean insulin-sensitive (LN) and obese insulin-resistant (OB) individuals revealed several species of lysophospholipids (lyso-PL) that were differentially-abundant. These changes coincided with greater expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an enzyme involved in phospholipid transacylation (Lands cycle). Strikingly, mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKO) exhibited greater muscle lyso-PC/PC, concomitant with greater insulin sensitivity in vivo and insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake ex vivo. Absence of LPCAT3 reduced phospholipid packing of the cellular membranes and increased plasma membrane lipid clustering, suggesting that LPCAT3 affects insulin receptor phosphorylation by modulating plasma membrane lipid organization. In conclusion, obesity accelerates the skeletal muscle Lands cycle, whose consequence might induce the disruption of plasma membrane organization that suppresses muscle insulin action.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme kinetic constants in vivo are largely unknown, which limits the construction of large metabolic models. While model fitting, in principle, aims at fitting kinetic constants to measured metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme concentrations, the resulting estimation problems are typically non-convex and hard to solve, especially if models are large. Here we assume that metabolic fluxes are known and show how consistent kinetic constants, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme concentrations can be determined simultaneously from data. If one specific term is omitted - a term that penalises small enzyme concentrations - we obtain a convex optimality problem with a unique local optimum. The estimation method with or without this term, called model balancing, applies to models with a wide range of rate laws and accounts for thermodynamic constraints on kinetic constants and metabolite concentrations through thermodynamic forces. It can be used to estimate in-vivo kinetic constants from omics data, to complete and adjust available data, or to construct plausible metabolic states with a predefined flux distribution. As a demonstrative case, we balance a model of E. coli central metabolism with artificial or experimental data. The tests show what information about kinetic constants can be obtained from omics data, and reveal the practical limits of estimating in-vivo kinetic constants.",

It is not known, however, whether it reflects, as in vertebrates, the operating of an underlying general magnitude system that estimates quantities irrespective of dimensions (e.g., number, space, time) and format (discrete, continuous). We investigated whether bees spontaneously transfer discrete discrimination of number to continuous discrimination of size. Bees were trained to discriminate between different numerical comparisons having either a 0.5 (2 vs. 4 and 4 vs. 8) or 0.67 ratio (2 vs. 3 and 4 vs. 6). Half of the subjects learnt to choose the smaller quantity and the other half the larger quantity. Bees were then tested for spontaneous choice (in the absence of reward) using comparisons with identical numbers but different sizes. Irrespective of the ratio of the stimuli, bees trained to select the smaller numerical quantity chose the congruent smaller size; bees trained to choose the larger numerical quantity chose the congruent larger size. This finding provides the first evidence for a cross-dimensional transfer between discrete (numerical) and continuous (spatial) dimensions in an invertebrate species and supports the hypothesis of a cognitive universality of a coding for general magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Identifying protein-protein interactions is crucial for a systems-level understanding of the cell. Recently, algorithms based on inverse statistical physics, e.g. Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), have allowed to use evolutionarily related sequences to address two conceptually related inference tasks: finding pairs of interacting proteins, and identifying pairs of residues which form contacts between interacting proteins. Here we address two underlying questions: How are the performances of both inference tasks related? How does performance depend on dataset size and the quality? To this end, we formalize both tasks using Ising models defined over stochastic block models, with individual blocks representing single proteins, and inter-block couplings protein-protein interactions; controlled synthetic sequence data are generated by Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that DCA is able to address both inference tasks accurately when sufficiently large training sets of known interaction partners are available, and that an iterative pairing algorithm (IPA) allows to make predictions even without a training set. Noise in the training data deteriorates performance. In both tasks we find a quadratic scaling relating dataset quality and size that is consistent with noise adding in square-root fashion and signal adding linearly when increasing the dataset. This implies that it is generally good to incorporate more data even if its quality is imperfect, thereby shedding light on the empirically observed performance of DCA applied to natural protein sequences.",

However, there is limited knowledge of the specific transcriptional and signaling programs that regulate interzone formation and fate diversification of synovial joint constituents. To address this, we have performed single cell RNA-Seq analysis of 6,202 synovial joint progenitor cells from the developing murine knee joint from E12.5 to E15.5. By using a combination of computational analytics, in situ hybridization, and functional analysis of prospectively isolated populations, we have inferred the underlying transcriptional networks of the major developmental paths for joint progenitors.

    "abstract": "In the marine environment bacterial-induced metamorphosis of larvae is a widespread cross-kingdom communication phenomenon and critical for the persistence of many marine invertebrates. However, the identities of most inducing bacterial signals and the underlying cellular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Larvae of Hydractinia echinata provide an excellent model for investigating bacteria-stimulated settlement as they transform upon detection of the signal into the colonial adult stage within 24 h. Although H. echinata served as cell biological model system for decades, the influence of bacterial signals on the morphogenic transition remained largely unexplored. Using a bioassay-guided analysis, we first identified that specific bacterial (lyso)phospholipids, naturally present in bacterial biofilms, elicit metamorphosis in Hydractinia larvae in a dose-response matter. In particular, lysophospholipids as single compounds or in combinations at 50 {micro}M concentrations induced metamorphosis in up to 50% of all larvae phospholipid within 48 h. By using fluorescence-labeled bacterial phospholipids, we demonstrated their incorporation into the larval membranes, where interactions with internal signaling cascades could occur. In addition, two structurally distinct exopolysaccharides, the newly identified Rha-Man polysaccharide from Pseudoalteromonas sp. P1-9 and curdlan from Alcaligenes faecalis caused up to 75% of all larvae to transform within 24 h. We also found that combinations of (lyso)phospholipids and curdlan induced the transformation in almost all larvae within 24 h, thereby exceeding the morphogenic activity observed for single compounds and axenic bacterial biofilms. Our results demonstrate that multiple and structurally distinct bacterial-derived metabolites converge to induce high transformation rates of Hydractinia larvae, which might ensure optimal habitat selection despite the general widespread occurrence of both compound classes.\n\nSignificance StatementBacterial biofilms profoundly influence the recruitment and settlement of marine invertebrates, critical steps for diverse marine processes such as coral reef formation, marine fisheries and the fouling of submerged surfaces. Yet, the complex composition of biofilms often makes it challenging to characterize the individual signals and regulatory mechanisms. Developing tractable model systems to characterize these co-evolved interactions is the key to understand fundamental processes in evolutionary biology. Here, we characterized for the first time two types of bacterial signaling molecules that induce the morphogenic transition and analyzed their abundance and combinatorial activity. This study highlights the crucial role of the converging activity of multiple bacterial signals in development-related cross-kingdom signaling.\n\nAreasMajor: Chemical Biology, Microbiology, Developmental Biology",

Many plasmids have a copy number greater than one such that the genes encoded on these plasmids are present in multiple copies per cell. This has evolutionary consequences by increasing the mutational target size, by prompting the (transitory) co-occurrence of mutant and wild-type alleles within the same cell, and by allowing for gene dosage effects. We develop and analyze a mathematical model for bacterial adaptation to harsh environmental change if adaptation is driven by beneficial alleles on multicopy plasmids. Successful adaptation depends on the availability of advantageous alleles and on their establishment probability. The establishment process involves the segregation of mutant and wild-type plasmids to the two daughter cells, allowing for the emergence of mutant-homozygous cells over the course of several generations. To model this process, we use the theory of multi-type branching processes, where a type is defined by the genetic composition of the cell. Both factors - the number of adaptive alleles and their establishment probability - depend on the plasmid copy number, and they often do so antagonistically. We find that in the interplay of various effects, a lower or higher copy number may maximize the probability of evolutionary rescue. The decisive factor is the dominance relationship between mutant and wild-type plasmids and potential gene dosage effects. Results from a simple model of antibiotic degradation indicate that the optimal plasmid copy number may depend on the specific environment encountered by the population.",

    "abstract": "The complement cascade is increasingly implicated in development of a variety of diseases with strong immune contributions such as Alzheimers disease and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Mouse models have been used to determine function of central components of the complement cascade such as C1q and C3. However, species differences in their gene structures mean that mice do not adequately replicate human complement regulators, including CR1 and CR2. Genetic variation in CR1 and CR2 have been implicated in modifying disease states but the mechanisms are not known. To decipher the roles of human CR1 and CR2 in health and disease, we engineered C57BL/6J (B6) mice to replace endogenous murine Cr2 with human complement receptors, CR1 and CR2 (B6.CR2CR1). CR1 has an array of allotypes in human populations and using traditional recombination methods (Flp-frt and Cre-loxP) two of the most common alleles (referred to as CR1long and CR1short) are replicated within this mouse model, along with a CR1 knockout allele (CR1KO). Transcriptional profiling of spleens and brains identifies genes and pathways differentially expressed between mice homozygous for either CR1long, CR1short or CR1KO. Gene set enrichment analysis predicts hematopoietic cell number and cell infiltration are modulated by CR1long, but not CR1short or CR1KO. Therefore, this mouse model provides a novel tool for determining the relationship between human-relevant CR1 alleles and disease.\n\nSummary StatementWe present the creation and validation of a novel mouse model that expresses human forms of complement cascade regulators CR1 and CR2.",

In prior studies, epigenetic editing with multimers of the transactivator VP16 and guide RNAs (gRNAs) was found to cause adverse cellular responses. These side effects may confound studies inducing new cellular properties, especially if the cellular responses are maintained through cell divisions - an epigenetic regulatory property. Here we show how distinct components of this CRISPR/dCas9 activation system, particularly untargeted gRNAs, upregulate genes associated with transcriptional stress, defense response, and regulation of cell death.

    "abstract": "The predominant methodology for DNA methylation analysis relies on the chemical deamination by sodium bisulfite of unmodified cytosine to uracil to permit the differential readout of methylated cytosines. Bisulfite treatment damages the DNA leading to fragmentation and loss of long-range methylation information. To overcome this limitation of bisulfite treated DNA we applied a new enzymatic deamination approach, termed EM-seq (Enzymatic Methyl-seq) to long-range sequencing technologies. Our methodology, named LR-EM-seq (Long Range Enzymatic Methyl-seq) preserves the integrity of DNA allowing long-range methylation profiling of 5-mC and 5-hmC over several kilobases of genomic DNA. When applied to known differentially methylated regions (DMR), LR-EM-seq achieves phasing of over 5 kb resulting in broader and better defined DMRs compared to previously reported. This result demonstrated the importance of phasing methylation for biologically relevant questions and the applicability of LR-EM-seq for long range epigenetic analysis at single molecule and single nucleotide resolution.",

    "abstract": "Refractory neonatal seizures do not respond to first-line anti-seizure medications (ASMs) like phenobarbital (PB), a positive allosteric modulator for GABAA receptors, the most widely used ASM to treat neonatal seizures. GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition is dependent upon neuronal chloride regulation. The electroneutral cation-chloride transporter KCC2 mediates neuronal chloride extrusion; an age-dependent increase of KCC2 expression enables the shift of GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. BDNF-TrkB activation following excitotoxic injury recruits downstream targets like PLC{gamma}1, leading to KCC2 hypofunction. This study investigated the efficacy of partial and full TrkB agonists; LM22A-4 (LM), HIOC and Deoxygedunin (DG) respectively, on PB-refractory seizures, post-ischemic TrkB-pathway activation, and KCC2 membrane stability in a P7 CD-1 mouse model of refractory neonatal seizures. Anti-seizure efficacy was determined by quantifying seizure burdens with continuous video-EEG. LM rescued PB-refractory seizures in a sexually dimorphic manner. LM anti-seizure efficacy was associated with a significant reduction in the post-ischemic phosphorylation of TrkB at Y816, a site known to mediate post-ischemic KCC2 hypofunction via PLC{gamma}1 activation. LM additionally rescued ischemia-induced pKCC2-S940 dephosphorylation preserving its membrane stability. HIOC and DG, two novel full TrkB agonists, also rescued PB-refractoriness and post-ischemic TrkB-PLC{gamma}1 pathway activation. Additionally, chemogenetic inactivation of TrkB significantly reduced post-ischemic neonatal seizure burdens at P7. Developmental expression profiles of TrkB and KCC2 in naive pups identified developmental differences that may underlie the sex-dependent variance in anti-seizure efficacy. These results support a novel role for the TrkB receptor in the emergence of age-dependent refractory neonatal seizures.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins are prone to misfolding and degradation. This is particularly true for mammalian forms of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). Though they function at the plasma membrane, mammalian GnRHRs tend to accumulate within the secretory pathway. Their apparent instability is believed to have evolved in response to selection for attenuated GnRHR activity. Nevertheless, the structural basis of this adaptation remains unclear. We find that this adaptation coincides with a C-terminal truncation and an increase in the polarity of its transmembrane (TM) domains. This enhanced polarity compromises the translocon-mediated cotranslational folding of two TM domains. Moreover, replacing a conserved polar residue in TM6 with an ancestral hydrophobic residue partially restores GnRHR expression with minimal impact on function. An evolutionary analysis suggests variations in the polarity of this residue are associated with reproductive differences. Our findings suggest the marginal energetics of cotranslational folding can be exploited to tune membrane protein fitness.",

Resulting patterns not only depend on species life-history but also vary regionally. Consequently, different populations of species with large ranges over different biomes might have experienced divergent drivers of diversification and show different population histories. Such a representative species is the common pheasant Phasianus colchicus, an ecological generalist with a wide distribution in the Palearctic and at the edge of the Oriental region. We aimed at identifying distinct phylogeographic lineages of the common pheasant and investigating their evolutionary trajectories.\n\nStudy locationAsia\n\nMethodsWe used coalescent approaches to describe the phylogeographic structure and to reconstruct the spatio-temporal diversification and demographic history of the common pheasant based on a comprehensive geographic sampling of 265 individuals genotyped at seven nuclear and two mitochondrial loci.\n\nResultsThe common pheasant diversified during the late Pleistocene into eight distinct evolutionary lineages which only partly correspond to traditional morphological groups. It originated at the edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and spread from there to East and Central Asia. Only the widely distributed genetically uniform lowland lineage of East Asia showed a recent range and population expansion, starting during last glacial. More phylogeographic structure was found elsewhere with lineages showing no signs of recent range expansions. One lineage of subtropical south-central China this is the result of long-term isolation in a climatically stable and topographically complex region. In others from arid Central Asia and China, demographic and range expansions were impeded by repeated population fragmentation during dry glacial and recent aridification. Given such a phylogeographic structure and demographic scenarios among lineages, we proposed split the range-wide common pheasant into three species.\n\nMain conclusionsSpatio-temporal phylogeographic frameworks of widespread species complexes such as the common pheasant provide valuable opportunities to identify regionally divergent drivers of diversification.",

    "abstract": "The pretreatment of biomass is a critical requirement of bio-renewable fuel production from lignocellulose. Although current processes primarily involve chemical and physical approaches, the biological breakdown of lignin using enzymes and microorganisms is quickly becoming an interesting eco-friendly alternative to classical processes. As a result, bioprospection of wild fungi from naturally occurring lignin-rich sources remains a suitable method to uncover and isolate new species exhibiting ligninolytic activity. In this study, wild species of white rot fungi were collected from Colombian forests based on their natural wood decay ability and high capacity to secrete oxidoreductases with high affinity for phenolic polymers such as lignin. Based on high activity obtained from solid-state fermentation using a lignocellulose source from oil palm as matrix, we describe the isolation and whole-genome sequencing of Dictyopanus pusillus, a wild basidiomycete fungus exhibiting ABTS oxidation as an indication of laccase activity. Functional characterization of a crude enzymatic extract identified laccase activity as the main enzymatic contributor to fungal extracts, an observation supported by the identification of 13 putative genes encoding for homologous laccases in the genome. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of an enzymatic extract exhibiting laccase activity in the Dictyopanus genera, offering means to exploit this species and its enzymes for the delignification process of lignocellulosic by-products from oil palm.",

    "abstract": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in northern Senegal, a Sahelian area characterized by a temporary pond network that drive both RVF mosquito population dynamics and nomadic herd movements. To investigate the mechanisms that explain RVF recurrent circulation, we modelled a realistic epidemiological system at the pond level integrating vector population dynamics, resident and nomadic ruminant herd population dynamics, and nomadic herd movements recorded in Younoufere area [1]. To calibrate the model, serological surveys were performed in 2015-2016 on both resident and nomadic herds in the same area. Mosquito population dynamics were obtained from a published model trained in the same region [2]. Model comparison techniques were used to compare five different scenarios of virus introduction by nomadic herds associated or not with vertical transmission in Aedes vexans. Our serological results confirmed a long lasting RVF endemicity in resident herds (IgG seroprevalence rate of 15.3%, n=222), and provided the first estimation of RVF IgG seroprevalence in nomadic herds in West Africa (12.4%, n=660). Multivariate analysis of serological data suggested an amplification of the transmission cycle during the rainy season with a peak of circulation at the end of that season. The best scenario of virus introduction combined yearly introductions of RVFV from 2008 to 2015 (the study period) by nomadic herds, with a proportion of viraemic individuals predicted to be larger in animals arriving during the 2nd half of the rainy season (3.4%). This result is coherent with the IgM prevalence rate (4%) found in nomadic herds sampled during the 2nd half of the rainy season. Although the existence of a vertical transmission mechanism in Aedes cannot be ruled out, our model demonstrates that nomadic movements are sufficient to account for this endemic circulation in northern Senegal.\n\nAuthor summaryRift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the most important vector borne disease in Africa, seriously affecting the health of domestic ruminants and humans and leading to severe economic consequences. This disease is endemic in northern Senegal, a Sahelian area characterized by a temporary pond network that drive both RVF mosquito population dynamics and nomadic herd movements. Two non-exclusive mechanisms may support this endemicity: recurrent introductions of the virus by nomadic animals, and vertical transmission of the virus (i.e. from infected female mosquito to eggs) in local Aedes populations. The authors followed up during 1 year resident and nomadic herds. They used the data thus obtained to model a realistic epidemiological system at the pond level integrating vector population dynamics, resident and nomadic ruminant herd population dynamics. They found that the best scenario explaining RVF remanence combined yearly introductions of RVFV by nomadic herds, with a proportion of viraemic predicted to be larger in animals arriving during the 2nd half of the rainy season, which is consistent with an amplification of virus circulation in the area during the rainy season. Although the existence of a vertical transmission mechanism in Aedes cannot be ruled out, their results demonstrates that nomadic movements are sufficient to account for this endemic circulation in northern Senegal.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record provides an invaluable insight into the temporal origins of extant lineages of organisms. However, establishing the relationships between fossils and extant lineages can be difficult in groups with low rates of morphological change over time. Molecular dating can potentially circumvent this issue by allowing distant fossils to act as calibration points, but rate variation across large evolutionary scales can bias such analyses. In this study, we apply multiple dating methods to genome-wide datasets to infer the origin of extant species of Isoetes, a group of mostly aquatic and semi-aquatic isoetalean lycopsids, which closely resemble fossil forms dating back to the Triassic. Rate variation observed in chloroplast genomes hampers accurate dating, but genome-wide nuclear markers place the origin of extant diversity within this group in the mid-Paleogene, 45-60 million years ago. Our genomic analyses coupled with a careful evaluation of the fossil record indicate that despite resembling forms from the Triassic, extant Isoetes species do not represent the remnants of an ancient and widespread group, but instead have spread around the globe in the relatively recent past.",

A peptide from C-terminus of interferon 1, conjugated to palmitoyl-lysine for cell penetration, denoted as IFN-C, was tested for its anti-inflammatory properties in ARPE-19 cells, followed by testing in a mouse model of EAU. Treatment with IFN-C and evaluation by RT-qPCR showed the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine. Inflammatory markers induced by treatment with TNF were suppressed when IFN-C was simultaneously present. TNF- mediated induction of NF-kB and signaling by IL-17A were attenuated by IFN-C. Differentiated ARPE-19 cells were treated with TNF in the presence or absence IFN-C and analyzed by immmunhistochemistry. IFN-C protected against the disruption integrity of tight junction proteins. Similarly, loss of transepithelial resistance caused by TNF was prevented by IFN-C. B10.RIII mice were immunized with a peptide from interphotoreceptor binding protein (IRBP) and treated by gavage with IFN-C. Development of uveitis was monitored by histology, fundoscopy, SD-OCT, and ERG. Treatment with IFN-C prevented uveitis in mice immunized with the IRBP peptide. Splenocytes isolated from mice with ongoing EAU exhibited antigenspecific T cell proliferation that was inhibited in the presence of IFN-C. IFN-C peptide exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and protects mice against damage to retinal structure and function suggesting that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune uveitis.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the brain parenchyma is facilitated by the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Homeostatically regulated electroencephalographic (EEG) slow waves are a hallmark of deep non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and have been implicated in the regulation of parenchymal CSF flow and brain clearance. The human AQP4 gene harbors several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AQP4 expression, brain-water homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, their role in sleep-wake regulation is unknown. To investigate whether functional variants in AQP4 modulate human sleep, nocturnal EEG-recordings and cognitive performance were investigated in 123 healthy participants genotyped for a common eight-SNP AQP4-haplotype. We show that this AQP4-haplotype is associated with distinct modulations of NREM slow wave energy, strongest in early sleep and mirrored by changes in sleepiness and reaction times during extended wakefulness. The study provides the first human evidence for a link between AQP4, deep NREM sleep and cognitive consequences of prolonged wakefulness.",

    "abstract": "Myelosuppression is one of the most common and severe adverse events associated with anti-cancer therapies and can be a source of drug attrition. Current mathematical modeling methods for assessing cytopenia risk rely on indirect measurements of drug effects and primarily focus on single lineage responses to drugs. However, anti-cancer therapies have diverse mechanisms with varying degrees of effect across hematopoietic lineages. To improve predictive understanding of drug-induced myelosuppression, we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of hematopoiesis in vitro for quantifying the effects of anti-cancer agents on multiple hematopoietic cell lineages. We calibrated the system parameters of the model to cell kinetics data without treatment and then validated the model by showing that the inferred mechanisms of anti-proliferation and/or cell-killing are consistent with the published mechanisms for three classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Using a set of compounds as a sample set, we then analyzed novel compounds to predict their mechanisms and magnitude of myelosuppression. Further, these quantitative mechanisms are valuable for the development of translational in vivo models to predict clinical cytopenia effects.\n\nAuthor SummaryReduced bone marrow activity and levels of mature blood cells is an undesirable side effect of many anti-cancer therapies. Selecting promising lead compounds for further development requires understanding of potential myelosuppressive effects. However, existing preclinical experiments and modeling formulations fail to consider drug effects on multiple blood cell types or the mechanistic differences between how drugs induced myelosuppression. Here we developed a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that estimates a drug candidates effect on multiple precursor and mature blood cell lineages and further distinguishes how the drug affects these populations - through cell-killing or anti-proliferation mechanisms. This modeling formalism is valuable for vetting compounds for therapeutic development and for further translational modeling to anticipate the clinical effects of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with back pain in juveniles and adults and are implicated in intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. Hypercaloric Western diets are associated with both obesity and type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine if obesity and type 2 diabetes result in spinal pathology in a sex-specific manner using in vivo diabetic and dietary mouse models. Leptin is an appetite-regulating hormone, and its deficiency leads to polyphagia, resulting in obesity and diabetes. Leptin is also associated with IVD degeneration, and increased expression of its receptor was identified in degenerated IVDs. We used young, leptin receptor deficient (Db/Db) mice to mimic the effect of diet and diabetes on adolescents. Db/Db and Control mice were fed either Western or Control diets, and were sacrificed at 3 months of age. Db/Db mice were obese, while only female mice developed diabetes. Female Db/Db mice displayed altered IVD morphology, with increased intradiscal notochordal band area, suggesting delayed IVD cell proliferation and differentiation, rather than IVD degeneration. Motion segments from Db/Db mice exhibited increased failure risk with decreased torsional failure strength. Db/Db mice also had inferior bone quality, which was most prominent in females. We conclude that obesity and diabetes due to impaired leptin signaling contribute to pathological changes in vertebrae, as well as an immature IVD phenotype, particularly of females, suggesting a sex-dependent role of leptin in the spine.",

    "abstract": "The morphology and physiology of diaspores play crucial roles in determining the fate of seeds in unpredictable habitats. In some genera of the Brassicaceae different types of diaspores can be found. Lepidium appelianum produces non-dormant seeds within indehiscent fruits while in L. campestre dormant seeds are released from dehiscent fruits. These different diaspore types offer an excellent model system to analyse the allocation of relevant defence compounds into different tissues, which may maximise diaspore fitness. Total glucosinolate concentration and composition were analysed in immature and mature seeds and pericarps of L. appelianum and L. campestre using high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, transgenic RNAi L. campestre lines were used for comparison that produce indehiscent fruits due to silencing of LcINDEHISCENCE, the INDEHISCENCE ortholog of L. campestre. Total glucosinolate concentrations were lower in green compared to mature seeds in all studied Lepidium species and transgenic lines. In contrast, indehiscent fruits of L. appelianum maintained their total glucosinolate concentration in mature pericarps compared to green ones, while in dehiscent L. campestre and in indehiscent RNAi-LcIND L. campestre a significant decrease in total glucosinolate concentrations from green to mature pericarps could be detected. Regarding the distribution of glucosinolate classes, high concentrations of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate were found in mature seeds of L. appelianum, while no indole glucosinolates were detected in mature diaspores of L. campestre. The diaspores of the latter species may rather depend on aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates for long-term protection. The allocation patterns of glucosinolates correlate with the morpho-physiologically distinct fruits of L. appelianum and L. campestre and may be explained by the distinct dispersal strategies and the dormancy status of both species.",

    "abstract": "The handling of medical bags in high temperature disaster sites has not been fully evaluated. In this study, medical bags were assessed in the closed, semi-opened, and opened state, with and without heat insulating material (HIM) and a coolant. The bags were heated for 300 minutes at 35 or 40{degrees}C, and the internal temperature was measured. closed and semi-opened bags were able to limit temperature increases in the central part of the bag at both 35 and 40{degrees}C to a greater extent than opened bags. When coolant and HIM were used in closed and semi-opened bags, the internal temperature was significantly lower than that seen in the opened state at 40{degrees}C (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, in high temperature disaster sites, medical bags should be maintained in a semi-opened or closed state using a HIM and coolant.",

    "abstract": "The chemistry of the soil solution is influenced by atmospheric deposition of air pollutants, by exchange processes between the soil matrix and the soil solution and by processes between the rhizosphere and the soil. At sites of the Intercantonal Long-term Forest Observation Programme in Switzerland the soil solution has been monitored since 1998 in a number of forest plots growing from 9 to 47 sites in a wide range of soil conditions and air pollution impacts. The results show various site-specific developments of soil acidification. At sites with already advanced acidification (pH < 4.2), the acidification indicators remained rather stable at high levels, possibly due to the high buffering capacity of the aluminum buffer (pH 4.2 - 3.8). In contrast, in less acidified sites the acidification still progressed further which is reflected by e.g. the ongoing decrease of the base cation to aluminum ratio. Main driver of the acidification is the high N deposition which provokes cation loss and impedes sustainable nutrient balances for tree nutrition in the majority of plots examined. On an average for the years 2005-2017, N leaching rates were 9.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1, ranging from 0.04 to 53 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Three plots with high N input show very low N leaching, suggesting that N leaching may not always be a good eutrophication indicator. Both N deposition and N leaching have decreased since the year 2000 but the latter trend is partly also due to increased drought.",
