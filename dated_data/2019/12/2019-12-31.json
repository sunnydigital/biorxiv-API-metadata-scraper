    "abstract": "Lupus nephritis (LN) occurs in up to 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity. LN presents as a highly heterogeneous disease both in histopathology and response to therapy. The molecular and cellular processes leading to renal damage and to the heterogeneity of the disease are not well understood. To elucidate the processes underpinning the heterogeneity of LN, we applied singlecell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to renal biopsies from LN patients. Skin biopsies were evaluated as a source of biomarkers for monitoring kidney disease. Type-I interferon (IFN) response signatures were identified in tubular cells and keratinocytes, differentiating LN patients from healthy controls. Non-responders associated with higher IFN signatures in both tissue compartments. Moreover, non-response was also associated with a fibrotic signature in the tubular cells. Receptor-ligand interaction analysis indicated that the fibrotic process is likely mediated by FGF receptors with the initiating signal originating from infiltrating leukocytes. Differential expression analysis of tubular cells between proliferative and membranous LN pointed to several fibrosis-relevant pathways, which may offer insight into their histological differences. In summary, scRNA-seq was applied to LN to deconstruct its heterogeneity and provide novel targets for personalized approaches to therapy.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveInflammatory bowel diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality. Aberrant NF-{kappa}B signalling is strongly associated with these conditions, and several established drugs influence the NF-{kappa}B signalling network to exert their effect. This study aimed to identify drugs which alter NF-{kappa}B signalling and may be repositioned for use in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nDesignThe SysmedIBD consortium established a novel drug-repurposing pipeline based on a combination of in-silico drug discovery and biological assays targeted at demonstrating an impact on NF-kappaB signalling, and a murine model of IBD.\n\nResultsThe drug discovery algorithm identified several drugs already established in IBD, including corticosteroids. The highest-ranked drug was the macrolide antibiotic Clarithromycin, which has previously been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in aseptic conditions.\n\nClarithromycins effects were validated in several experiments: it influenced NF-{kappa}B mediated transcription in murine peritoneal macrophages and intestinal enteroids; it suppressed NF-{kappa}B protein shuttling in murine reporter enteroids; it suppressed NF-{kappa}B (p65) DNA binding in the small intestine of mice exposed to LPS, and it reduced the severity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Clarithromycin also suppressed NF-{kappa}B (p65) nuclear translocation in human intestinal enteroids.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that in-silico drug repositioning algorithms can viably be allied to laboratory validation assays in the context of inflammatory bowel disease; and that further clinical assessment of clarithromycin in the management of inflammatory bowel disease is required.",

    "abstract": "We earlier reported cytoplasmic fluorescence exchange between cultured human fibroblasts (Fib) and malignant cells (MC). Others report similar transfer via either tunneling nanotubes (TNT) or shed membrane vesicles and this changes the phenotype of recipient cells. Our current time-lapse microscopy showed most exchange was from Fib into MC, with less in the reverse direction. Although TNT were seen, we were surprised transfer was not via TNT, but was instead via fine and often branching cell projections that defied direct visual resolution because of their size and rapid movement. Their structure was revealed nonetheless, by their organellar cargo and the grooves they formed indenting MC, while this was consistent with holotomography. Discrete, rapid and highly localized transfer events, evidenced against a role for shed vesicles. Transfer coincided with rapid retraction of the cell-projections, suggesting a hydrodynamic mechanism. Increased hydrodynamic pressure in retracting cell-projections normally returns cytoplasm to the cell body. We hypothesize  cell-projection pumping (CPP), where cytoplasm in retracting cell-projections partially equilibrates into adjacent recipient cells via micro-fusions that form temporary inter-cellular cytoplasmic continuities. We tested plausibility for CPP by combined mathematical modelling, comparison of predictions from the model with experimental results, and then computer simulations based on experimental data. The mathematical model predicted preferential CPP into cells with lower cell stiffness, expected from equilibration of pressure towards least resistance. Predictions from the model were satisfied when Fib were co-cultured with MC, and fluorescence exchange related with cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy. When transfer into 5000 simulated recipient MC or Fib was studied in computer simulations, inputting experimental cell stiffness and donor cell fluorescence values generated transfers to simulated recipient cells similar to those seen by experiment. We propose CPP as a potentially novel mechanism in mammalian inter-cellular cytoplasmic transfer and communication.\n\nSIGNIFICANCETime-lapse observations of co-cultured cells led us to hypothesize what we believe to be a novel hydrodynamic mechanism transferring cytoplasm between cells. Similar transfer by other mechanisms markedly affects cell behavior. Combined mathematical modelling, satisfaction of predictions from the mathematical model in cell culture experiments, and separate computer simulations that generate outcomes similar to experimental observations, support our hypothesized mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV) are most often evaluated by vector competence and the related extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which represent the proportion of vectors that become infectious given exposure and the time it takes for a vector to become infectious given exposure, respectively. Thus, EIP is the temporality of vector competence, and these measures have been used to evaluate the relative fitness of arbovirus systems. However, another temporal process critical to assessing arbovirus transmission dynamics is the age-structure of vector populations, as studies have demonstrated how vector mortality interplays with vector competence and EIP to alter transmission system efficiency. These and other parameters are critical to vectorial capacity (VC), a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system. However, how these three components - EIP, vector competence, and age - affect VC still needs to be addressed. We first compared experimentally how vector competence/EIP and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Ageacquisition) interacted in an Aedes aegypti-ZIKV model system. We found that Ageacquisition did not alter the vector competence/EIP using traditional analyses, except in the context of mortality. To capture and quantify this age-dependent context, we developed an age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VCage) by experimentally determining daily mortality and probability of biting, as well as vector competence/EIP parameterized as EIPMin and EIPMax. Like previous studies, we found that arbovirus phenotypes leading to outbreaks are not straightforward and may follow a tortoise and the hare (TotH), whereby slow and steady is as or better than fast and furious phenotypes. Understanding the contributions of these age-dependent life traits as well as VCage allows for quantification and visualization of both the magnitude and temporality of transmission dynamics in an age-dependent manner, which reveals this TotH model that should change how compare and rank arbovirus phenotypes, and perhaps even how we identify  highly or  negligibly competent vectors.",

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.",

Here we studied the neurotoxicity of human A53T, mouse aSyn, and various human-mouse chimeras in cellular and in vivo models as well as their biochemical properties relevant to aSyn pathobiology. We report that mouse aSyn is less neurotoxic than the human A53T variant as a result of inhibitory effects of two C-terminal amino acid substitutions on membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle permeabilization. Our findings highlight the importance of membrane-induced self-assembly in aSyn neurotoxicity and suggest that inhibiting this process by targeting the C-terminal domain could slow neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathy disorders.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn vivo transposon mutagenesis, coupled with deep sequencing, enables large-scale genome-wide mutant screens for genes essential in different growth conditions. We analyzed six large-scale studies performed on haploid strains of three yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccaromyces pombe, and Candida albicans), each mutagenized with two of three different heterologous transposons (AcDs, Hermes, and PiggyBac). Using a machine-learning approach, we evaluated the ability of the data to predict gene essentiality. Important data features included sufficient numbers and distribution of independent insertion events. All transposons showed some bias in insertion site preference because of jackpot events, and preferences for specific insertion sequences and short-distance vs long-distance insertions. For PiggyBac, a stringent target sequence limited the ability to predict essentiality in genes with few or no target sequences. The machine learning approach also robustly predicted gene function in less well-studied species by leveraging cross-species orthologs. Finally, comparisons of isogenic diploid versus haploid S. cerevisiae isolates identified several genes that are haplo-insufficient, while most essential genes, as expected, were recessive. We provide recommendations for the choice of transposons and the inference of gene essentiality in genome-wide studies of eukaryotic haploid microbes such as yeasts, including species that have been less amenable to classical genetic studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The geographically restricted Mycobacterium africanum lineages (MAF) are primarily found in West Africa, where they account for a significant proportion of tuberculosis. Despite this phenomenon, little is known about the co-evolution of these ancient lineages with West Africans. MAF and M. tuberculosis sensu stricto lineages (MTB) differ in their clinical, in vitro and in vivo characteristics for reasons not fully understood. Therefore, we compared genomes of 289 MAF and 205 MTB clinical isolates from the 6 main human-adapted M. tuberculosis complex lineages, for mutations in their Electron Transport Chain and Central Carbon Metabolic pathway in order to explain these metabolic differences. Furthermore, we determined, in silico, whether each mutation could affect the function of genes encoding enzymes in these pathways.\n\nWe found more mutations with the potential to affect enzymes in these pathways in MAF lineages compared to MTB lineages. We also found that similar mutations occurred in these pathways between MAF and some MTB lineages.\n\nGenerally, our findings show further differences between MAF and MTB lineages that may have contributed to the MAF clinical and growth phenotype and indicate potential adaptation of MAF lineages to a distinct ecological niche, which we suggest includes areas characterized by low oxygen tension.",

How cyclic clock gene expression is translated into timely morphological somite formation has remained unclear. A posterior to anterior gradient of increasing PSM tissue cohesion correlates with increasing fibronectin matrix complexity around the PSM, suggesting that fibronectin-dependent tissue mechanics may be involved in this transition. Here we address whether the mechanical properties of the PSM tissue play a role in regulating the pathway leading to cleft formation in the anterior PSM. We first interfered with cytoskeletal contractility in the chick PSM by disrupting actomyosin-mediated contractility directly or via Rho-associated protein kinase function. Then we perturbed fibronectin matrix accumulation around the PSM tissue by blocking integrin-fibronectin binding or fibronectin matrix assembly. All four treatments perturbed hairy1 and meso1 expression dynamics and resulted in defective somitic clefts. A model is presented where a gradient of fibronectin-dependent tissue mechanics participates in the PSM wavefront of maturation by ensuring the correct spatio-temporal conversion of cyclic segmentation clock gene expression into periodic somite formation.",

Therefore, there is a need to identify mechanisms driving formation of precancerous lesions and their progression towards invasive tumor using experimental models that faithfully recapitulate human tumorigenesis.\n\nMethodsWe generated a new mouse model which combines cholangiocyte-specific expression of KrasG12D with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine diet-induced inflammation to mimic iCCA development in patients with cholangitis. Histological and transcriptomic analyses of the mouse precursor lesions and iCCA were performed and compared with human analyses. The function of genes overexpressed during tumorigenesis was investigated in human cell lines.\n\nResultsMice expressing KrasG12D in cholangiocytes and fed a DDC diet developed cholangitis, ductular proliferations, intraductal papillary neoplasms of bile ducts (IPNBs) and eventually iCCAs. The histology of mouse and human IPNBs were highly similar, and mouse iCCAs displayed histological characteristics of human mucin-producing large duct type iCCA. Signaling pathways activated in human iCCA were activated in mice. The identification of transition zones between IPNB and iCCA on tissue sections, combined with RNA-sequencing analyses of the lesions supported that iCCAs derive from IPNBs. We provide evidence that a gene cascade which comprises KRASG12D, SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) and Tensin 4 (TNS4), and which is activated by epidermal growth factor, promotes tumor progression.\n\nConclusionsWe developed a novel mouse model that faithfully recapitulates human iCCA tumorigenesis and identified a gene cascade promoting tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito microbiota impacts the physiology of its host and is essential for normal larval development, thereby influencing transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Germ-free mosquitoes generated with current methods show larval stunting and developmental deficits. Therefore, functional studies of the mosquito microbiota have so far mostly been limited to antibiotic treatments of emerging adults. In this study, we developed a novel approach to produce germ-free Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It is based on reversible colonisation with bacteria genetically modified to allow complete decolonisation at any developmental stage. We show that, unlike germ-free mosquitoes previously produced using sterile diets, reversibly colonised mosquitoes show no developmental retardation and reach the same size as control adults. This allowed us to uncouple the study of the microbiota in larvae and adults. In adults, we detected no impact of bacterial colonisation on mosquito fecundity or longevity. In larvae, we performed a transcriptome analysis and diet supplementation experiments following decolonisation during the third larval instar. Our data suggest that bacteria support larval development by contributing to folate biosynthesis and by enhancing energy storage. Our study establishes a novel tool to study the microbiota in insects and deepens our knowledge on the metabolic contribution of bacteria to mosquito development.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a technique that is gaining widespread use in molecular evolution studies and protein engineering. Accurate reconstruction requires the ability to handle appropriately large numbers of sequences, as well as insertion and deletion (\"indel\") events, but available approaches exhibit limitations. To address these limitations, we developed Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP), which efficiently implements maximum likelihood methods to enable the inference of ancestors of families with more than 10,000 members. GRASP implements partial order graphs (POGs) to represent and infer insertion and deletion events across ancestors, enabling the identification of building blocks for protein engineering.\n\nTo validate the capacity to engineer novel proteins from realistic data, we predicted ancestor sequences across three distinct enzyme families: glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, cytochromes P450, and dihydroxy/sugar acid dehydratases (DHAD). All tested ancestors demonstrated enzymatic activity. Our study demonstrates the ability of GRASP (1) to support large data sets over 10,000 sequences and (2) to employ insertions and deletions to identify building blocks for engineering biologically active ancestors, by exploring variation over evolutionary time.\n\nAuthor summaryMassive sequencing projects expose the extent of natural, genetic diversity. Here, we describe a method with capacity to perform ancestor sequence reconstruction from data sets in excess of 10,000 sequences, poised to recover ancestral diversity, including the evolutionary events that determine present-time biological function and structure.\n\nWe introduce a novel strategy for suggesting \"indel variants\" that are distinct from, but can be explored alongside, substitution variants for creating ancestral libraries. We demonstrate how indels can be used as building blocks to form \"hybrid ancestors\"; based on this strategy, we synthesise ancestor variants, with varying enzymatic activities, for wide-ranging applications in the biotechnology sector.",

    "abstract": "Computational approaches for inferring the mechanisms of compound-protein interactions (CPIs) can greatly facilitate drug development. Recently, although a number of deep learning based methods have been proposed to predict binding affinities and attempt to capture local interaction sites in compounds and proteins through neural attentions, they still lack a systematic evaluation on the interpretability of the identified local features. In addition, in these previous approaches, the exact matchings between interaction sites from compounds and proteins, which are generally important for understanding drug mechanisms of action, still remain unknown. Here, we compiled the first benchmark dataset containing the inter-molecular non-covalent interactions for more than 10,000 compound-protein pairs, and used it to systematically evaluate the interpretability of neural attentions in existing prediction models. We developed a multi-objective neural network, called MONN, to predict both non-covalent interactions and binding affinity for a given compound-protein pair. MONN uses convolution neural networks on molecular graphs of compounds and primary sequences of proteins to effectively capture the intrinsic features from both inputs, and also takes advantage of the predicted non-covalent interactions to further boost the accuracy of binding affinity prediction. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrated that while the previous neural attention based approaches fail to exhibit satisfactory interpretability results without extra supervision, MONN can successfully predict non-covalent interactions on our benchmark dataset as well as another independent dataset derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Moreover, MONN can outperform other state-of-the-art methods in predicting compound-protein binding affinities. In addition, the pairwise interactions predicted by MONN displayed compatible and accordant patterns in chemical properties, which provided another evidence to support the strong predictive power of MONN. These results suggested that MONN can offer a powerful tool in predicting binding affinities of compound-protein pairs and also provide useful insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of compound-protein interactions, which thus can greatly advance the drug discovery process.

    "abstract": "Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are a crucial mechanism underpinning the function of the cell. Predicting the likely relationship between a pair of proteins is thus an important problem in bioinformatics, and a wide range of machine-learning based methods have been proposed for this task. Their success is heavily dependent on the construction of the feature vectors, with most using a set of physico-chemical properties derived from the sequence. Few work directly with the sequence itself.\n\nRecent works on embedding sequences in a low dimensional vector space has shown the utility of this approach for tasks such as protein classification and sequence search. In this paper, we extend these ideas to the PPI task, making inferences from the pair instead of for the individual sequences. We evaluate the method on human and yeast PPI datasets, benchmarking against the established methods. These results demonstrate that we can obtain sequence encodings for the PPI task which achieve similar levels of performance to existing methods without reliance on complex physico-chemical feature sets.",

The method is based on the assessment of gene coverage for each single cell and its skewness as a quality measure. To validate the method, we investigated the impact of poor quality cells on downstream analyses and compared biological differences between typical and poor quality cells. Moreover, we measured the ratio of intergenic expression, suggesting genomic contamination, and foreign organism contamination of single-cell samples. SkewC is tested in 37,993 single-cells generated by 15 scRNA-seq protocols. We envision SkewC as an indispensable QC method to be incorporated into scRNA-seq experiment to preclude the possibility of scRNA-seq data misinterpretation.",

In this study, we confirmed the growth promotion activity of the plant growth-promoting bacterium Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 on the microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus C1S. We show that this activity is critically dependent on bacterial indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) production, which results in a decrease in algal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, higher cell densities and ameliorates algal cells bleaching after nitrogen deprivation. We also show a close inter-species interaction between both partners and an active expression of the bacterial ipdC gene involved in production of IAA when co-cultivated.\n\nThis study extends the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying bacteria-microalgae consortia to improve their technological applications and to better understand ecological relationships in the environment.",

    "abstract": "RationalThe myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematological malignancies characterized by hematopoietic stem cell expansion and overproduction of mature blood cells. Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MPNs. The acquired kinase mutation JAK2V617F plays a central role in these disorders. Mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular dysfunction in MPNs are not fully understood, limiting the effectiveness of current treatment.\n\nObjectiveVascular endothelial cells (ECs) play critical roles in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. ECs carrying the JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in patients with MPNs. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the JAK2V617F mutation alters endothelial function to promote cardiovascular complications in patients with MPNs.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe employed murine models of MPN in which the JAK2V617F mutation is expressed in specific cell lineages. When JAK2V617F is expressed in both blood cells and vascular ECs, the mice developed MPN and spontaneous, age-related dilated cardiomyopathy with an increased risk of sudden death as well as a prothrombotic and vasculopathy phenotype on histology evaluation. We showed that JAK2V617F-mutant ECs are required for this cardiovascular disease phenotype and the mutation can alter endothelial cell function. Finally, in a more therapeutically oriented approach, we demonstrated that transplantation with wild-type donor marrow cells can improve cardiac function by reversing the left ventricle remodeling process in this JAK2V617F-positive MPN murine model.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that the JAK2V617F mutation alters vascular endothelial function to promote cardiovascular complications in MPNs. Therefore, targeting the MPN vasculature represents a promising new therapeutic strategy for patients with MPNs.",

    "abstract": "Two types of neural circuits contribute to legged locomotion: central pattern generators (CPGs) that produce rhythmic motor commands (even in the absence of feedback, termed \"fictive locomotion\"), and reflex circuits driven by sensory feedback. Each circuit alone serves a clear purpose, and the two together are understood to cooperate during normal locomotion. The difficulty is in explaining their relative balance objectively within a control model, as there are infinite combinations that could produce the same nominal motor pattern. Here we propose that optimization in the presence of uncertainty can explain how the circuits should best be combined for locomotion. The key is to re- interpret the CPG in the context of state estimator-based control: an internal model of the limbs that predicts their state, using sensory feedback to optimally balance competing effects of environmental and sensory uncertainties. We demonstrate use of optimally predicted state to drive a simple model of bipedal, dynamic walking, which thus yields minimal energetic cost of transport and best stability. The internal model may be implemented with classic neural half-center circuitry, except with neural parameters determined by optimal estimation principles. Fictive locomotion also emerges, but as a side effect of estimator dynamics rather than an explicit internal rhythm. Uncertainty could be key to shaping CPG behavior and governing optimal use of feedback.\n\nNew and NoteworthySensory feedback modulates the central pattern generator (CPG) rhythm in locomotion, but there lacks an explanation for how much feedback is appropriate. We propose destabilizing noise as a determinant, where an uncertain environment demands more feedback, but noisy sensors demand less. We reinterpret the CPG as an internal model for predicting body state despite noise. Optimizing its feedback yields robust and economical gait in a walking model, and explains the advantages of feedback-driven CPG control.",

    "abstract": "Irreversible hair cell (HC) loss in the inner ear is the leading cause for hearing and balance disorders. Discovery of therapeutic molecules preventing HC death and promoting regeneration, which does not occur in mammals like it does in lower vertebrates, is of major interest. In fish, HCs are also found in a superficial mechano-sensory organ called the lateral line (LL). LL-HCs are exposed to surrounding waters and are accessible to waterborne molecules providing a potent mean to study in vivo HC stability and regeneration. Commercial small molecule libraries were tested in screens for HC survival and regeneration in zebrafish, but ethnobotanical pharmacopeias remain totally unexplored because of the challenge that such complex mixtures represent. A rapid and cost-effective first-pass assay informing about the regenerative potential of an extract is therefore critical before embarking on cumbersome purification steps. We chose to test Valerian crude root extracts (Val), which are typically composed of more than 150 different components, amongst which is a main and abundant compound: valeric acid (VA). VA discovery and purification led to the commercialization of a synthetic analog: Valproic acid (VPA) which is a first-line drug for epilepsy and bipolar disorders that was also shown to significantly hamper LL-HC regeneration. We reasoned that if Val is not toxic, it would elicit effects like VPA. Thus, we synchronously ablated HCs in 5-day post-fertilization (dpf) larvae and monitored regeneration over the following 3 days in the presence of Val at the highest well-tolerated concentration (Val1 = 1mg/ml), or VPA (= 150M) as previously published. Both treatments significantly decreased HC regeneration without affecting HC-survival suggesting a similar mode of action. Furthermore, Val application as early as 3dpf and prolonged for up to 4 days did not affect larval survival, indicating that reduced HC-regeneration was not due to overall toxicity. Taken together, Val and VPA-treatments displayed a comparable response in a simple and up-scalable HC-regeneration assay which is an in-first-pass potent approach for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "A stochastic model of spontaneous actin wave formation in eukaryotic cells that includes positive feedback between the actin network and filament nucleating factors on the membrane is developed and analyzed. Simulation results show that the model can produce a variety of actin network behavior depending on the conditions. Actin spots of diameter about 0.5 {micro}m can be formed and persist for tens of seconds at low actin concentrations, and these spots may either shrink and die or grow and develop into fully-developed propagating waves. The model correctly captures the vertical profile of actin waves along line scans through wave fronts, as well as the separation between the region enclosed by circular actin waves and the external area. Our results show how the complicated actin behavior depends on the amounts and state of various membrane molecules.\n\nAuthor SummaryLocomotion of eukaryotic cells is a complex process that involves the spatio-temporal control and integration of a number of sub-processes, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, local and global modification of the cytoskeleton, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response. In view of the complexity of the processes, understanding how force generation and mechanical interactions with the surroundings are controlled in space and time to produce cell-level movement is a major challenge. Recent experimental work has shown that a variety of actin waves propagate within cells, both under normal conditions and during re-building of the cytoskeleton following its disruption. Controlled disruption and re-building of the actin network has led to new insights into the key components involved in actin waves, and here we develop a stochastic model that can qualitatively and quantitatively describe the dynamical behavior of such waves.",

    "abstract": "Stem and progenitor populations within developing embryos are diverse, composed of different subpopulations of precursor cells with varying developmental potential. How these different subpopulations are coordinately regulated by their signaling environments is not well understood. In this paper we develop a framework for controlling progenitor population structure in cell culture using high-throughput single cell mRNA-seq and computational analysis. We find that the natural transcriptional diversity of neural stem cell populations from the developing mouse brain collapses during in vitro culture. Cell populations are depleted of committed neuroblast progenitors and become dominated by a single pre-astrocytic cell population. By analyzing the response of neural stem cell populations to forty combinatorial signaling conditions, we demonstrate that signaling environments can restructure cell populations by modulating the relative abundance of pre-astrocytic and pre-neuronal subpopulations according to a simple log-linear model. Our work demonstrates that single-cell RNA-seq can be applied to learn how to modulate the diversity of stem cell populations, providing a new strategy for population-level stem cell control.\n\nHighlightsO_LINatural progenitor diversity in the brain collapses during in vitro culture to a single progenitor type\nC_LIO_LILoss of progenitor diversity alters fate potential of cells during differentiation\nC_LIO_LILarge scale single-cell signaling screen identifies signals that reshape population structure towards neuronal cell types\nC_LIO_LISignals regulate population structure according to a simple log-linear model\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/890087v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5286corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0e69borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@640b20org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16779e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA/DNA molecules that bind to specific target molecules. Aptamers with high binding-affinity and target specificity are identified using an in vitro procedure called high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (HT-SELEX). However, the development of aptamer affinity reagents takes a considerable amount of time and is costly because HT-SELEX produces a large dataset of candidate sequences, some of which have insufficient binding-affinity. Here, we present RNA aptamer Ranker (RaptRanker), a novel in silico method for identifying high binding-affinity aptamers from HT-SELEX data by scoring and ranking. RaptRanker analyzes HT-SELEX data by evaluating the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure simultaneously, and by ranking according to scores reflecting local structure and sequence frequencies. To evaluate the performance of RaptRanker, we performed two new HT-SELEX experiments, and evaluated binding affinities of a part of sequences that include aptamers with low binding-affinity. In both datasets, the performance of RaptRanker was superior to Frequency, Enrichment and MPBind. We also confirmed that the consideration of secondary structures is effective in HT-SELEX data analysis, and that RaptRanker successfully predicted the essential subsequence motifs in each identified sequence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcoustic telemetry technologies are being rapidly deployed to study a variety of aquatic taxa including fishes, reptiles, and marine mammals. Large cooperative telemetry networks produce vast quantities of data useful in the study of movement, resource selection and species distribution. Efficient use of acoustic telemetry data requires estimation of acoustic source locations from detections at sensors (i.e. localization). Multiple processes provide information for localization estimation including detection/non-detection data at sensors, information on signal rate, and an underlying movement model describing how individuals move and utilize space. Frequently, however, localization methods only integrate a subset of these processes and do not utilize the full spatial encounter history information available from sensor arrays.\n\nMethodsIn this paper we draw analogies between the challenges of acoustic telemetry localization and newly developed methods of spatial capture-recapture (SCR). We develop a framework for localization that integrates explicit sub-models for movement, signal (or cue) rate, and detection probability, based on acoustic telemetry spatial encounter history data. This method, which we call movement-assisted localization, makes efficient use of the full encounter history data available from acoustic sensor arrays, provides localizations with fewer than three detections, and even allows for predictions to be made of the position of an individual when it was not detected at all. We demonstrate these concepts by developing generalizable Bayesian formulations of the SCR movement-assisted localization model to address study-specific challenges common in acoustic telemetry studies.\n\nResultsSimulation studies show that movement-assisted localization models improve point-wise RMSE of localization estimates by > 50% and greatly increased the precision of estimated trajectories compared to localization using only the detection history of a given signal. Additionally, integrating a signal rate sub-model reduced biases in the estimation of movement, signal rate, and detection parameters observed in independent localization models.\n\nConclusionsMovement-assisted localization provides a flexible framework to maximize the use of acoustic telemetry data. Conceptualizing localization within an SCR framework allows extensions to a variety of data collection protocols, improves the efficiency of studies interested in movement, resource selection, and space-use, and provides a unifying framework for modeling acoustic data.",

    "abstract": "The similarities and differences between nervous systems of various species result from developmental constraints and specific adaptations 1-4. Comparative analyses of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region of the cerebral cortex involved in higher-order cognition and complex social behaviors, have identified confirmed and putative human-specific structural and molecular changes 4-8. For example, one crucial specialization involves the anterior-posterior gradient in synaptic density, with a disproportionately higher number of dendritic spines specifically in the human PFC compared to other analyzed primates 5. These changes are likely mediated by divergence in spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression 9-17, which are prominent in the mid-fetal human cerebral neocortex 15,18-20. Analyzing developmental human and macaque brain transcriptomic data 15,20, we identified a transient PFC- and laminar-specific upregulation of the gene encoding cerebellin 2 (CBLN2), a neurexin (NRXN) and glutamate receptor delta (GRID/GluD)-associated synaptic organizer 21-27, in human mid-fetal development coinciding with the initiation of synaptogenesis. Moreover, we show that this difference in expression level and laminar distribution of CBLN2, is due to Hominini-specific deletions affecting SOX5 binding sites within a retinoic acid-responsive CBLN2 enhancer. In situ genetic humanization of the mouse Cbln2 enhancer drives increased and ectopic laminar Cbln2 expression and promotes glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptogenesis specifically in the PFC. These findings identify a putative genetic and molecular basis for the disproportionately increased connectivity in the Hominini PFC and suggest a developmental mechanism linking dysfunction of the NRXN-GRID-CBLN2 complex, to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

While developmental mechanisms governing regional patterning of the rodent cerebral cortex have been characterized10-15, the mechanisms underlying the development of PFC-MD connectivity and the lateral expansion of PFC with distinct granular layer 4 in anthropoid primates16-23 have not been elucidated. Here we report increased concentration of retinoic acid (RA), a signaling molecule involved in brain development and function24, 25 in the prospective PFC areas of human and macaque, compared to mouse, during mid-fetal development, a crucial period for cortical circuit assembly. In addition, we observed the lateral expansion of RA synthesizing enzyme, ALDH1A3, expression in mid-fetal macaque and human frontal cortex, compared to mouse. Furthermore, we found that enrichment of RA signaling is restricted to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a gene encoding an RA-catabolizing enzyme upregulated in the mid-fetal motor cortex. Gene deletion in mice revealed that RA signaling through anteriorly upregulated RA receptors, Rxrg and Rarb, and Cyp26b1-dependent catabolism is required for the proper molecular patterning of PFC and motor areas, the expression of the layer 4 marker RORB, intra-PFC synaptogenesis, and the development of reciprocal PFC-MD connectivity. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for RA signaling in PFC development and, potentially, its evolutionary expansion.",

    "abstract": "An essential heterodimer of the U2AF1 and U2AF2 pre-mRNA splicing factors nucleates spliceosome assembly at polypyrimidine (Py) signals preceding the major class of 3' splice sites. Among myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), U2AF1 frequently acquires an S34F-encoding mutation. The influence of the U2AF1 subunit and its S34F mutation on the U2AF2 conformations remains unknown. Here, we employ single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine the influence of wild-type or S34F-substituted U2AF1 on the conformational dynamics of U2AF2 and its splice site RNA complexes. In the absence of RNA, the U2AF1 subunit stabilizes a high FRET value, which by structure-guided mutagenesis corresponds to a closed conformation of the tandem U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). When the U2AF heterodimer is bound to a strong, uridine-rich splice site, U2AF2 switches to a lower FRET value characteristic of an open, side-by-side arrangement of the RRMs. Remarkably, the U2AF heterodimer binds weak, uridine-poor Py tracts as a mixture of closed and open U2AF2 conformations, which are modulated by the S34F mutation. Shifts between open and closed U2AF2 may underlie U2AF1-dependent splicing of degenerate Py tracts and contribute to a subset of S34F-dysregulated splicing events in MDS patients.",

    "abstract": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are prevalent across the tree of life and regulate nearly all aspects of cellular functions by catalyzing synthesis of glycosidic linkages between diverse donor and acceptor substrates. Despite the availability of GT sequences from diverse organisms, the evolutionary basis for their complex and diverse modes of catalytic and regulatory functions remain enigmatic. Here, based on deep mining of over half a million GT-A fold sequences from diverse organisms, we define a minimal core component shared among functionally diverse enzymes. We find that variations in the common core and the emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to the evolution of catalytic and functional diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during the course of evolution. We identify conserved modes of donor and acceptor recognition in evolutionarily divergent families and pinpoint the sequence and structural features for functional specialization. Using the evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 88% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs in five model organisms. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating the complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the origin of the inductive signal that translates the amputation stress into a cooperative cellular response. By studying the process underlying the reformation of lost body parts in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, we identified a regeneration-inducing structure that, via a tissue crosstalk, is responsible for the initiation of the repair program. We further revealed for the first time in anthozoan cnidarians, that fast and slow-cycling/quiescent stem cells respond to the amputation stress and actively participate in the reformation of lost body parts. Importantly, a synergic interaction of both stem cell populations is required to complete the regeneration process. Our findings suggest that the emergence/loss of structure complexity/compartmentalization influences the proprieties of tissue plasticity, changes the competence of a tissue to reprogram and, in the context of regeneration, the capacity of the tissue to emit or respond to a regeneration-inducing signal.",

However, studies with flat filters have not captured all aspects of physical transparency, such as caustics, specular reflections/highlights, and shadows. Here, we investigate color matching experiments with three-dimensional transparent objects for different matching stimuli: a uniform patch and a flat filter overlaying a variegated background. Two different instructions were given to observers: change the color of the matching stimulus until it has the same color as the transparent object (for the patch and flat filter) or until it has the same color as the dye that was used to tint the transparent object (for the patch). Regardless of instruction or matching element, observers match the mean chromaticity of the glass object, but the luminance of matches depends on the backgrounds of the test image and the matching element, indicating that a color constancy-esque discounting operation is at work. We applied three models from flat filter studies to see if they generalize to our stimuli: the convergence model and the ratio of either the means (RMC) or standard deviations (RSD) of cone excitations. The convergence model does not generalize to our stimuli, but the RMC generalizes to a wider range of stimuli than the RSD. However, there is an edge case where RMC also breaks down and there may be additional features that trade-off with RMC when observers match the color of thick, curved transparent objects.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreating cancer depends in part on identifying the mutations driving each patients disease. Many clinical laboratories are adopting high-throughput sequencing for assaying patients tumours, applying targeted panels to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissues to detect clinically-relevant mutations. While there have been some benchmarking and best practices studies of this scenario, much variant-calling work focuses on whole-genome or whole-exome studies, with fresh or fresh-frozen tissue. Thus, definitive guidance on best choices for sequencing platforms, sequencing strategies, and variant calling for clinical variant detection is still being developed.\n\nResultsBecause ground truth for clinical specimens is rarely known, we used the well-characterized Coriell cell lines GM12878 and GM12877 to generate data. We prepared samples to mimic as closely as possible clinical biopsies, including formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. We evaluated two well-known targeted sequencing panels, Illuminas TruSight 170 panel and the Oncomine Focus panel. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 and an Ion Torrent PGM respectively. We performed multiple biological replicates of each assay, to test reproducibility. Finally, we applied five different public and freely-available somatic single-nucleotide variant (SNV) callers to the data, MuTect2, SAMtools, VarScan2, Pisces and VarDict. Although the TruSight 170 and Oncomine Focus panels cover different amounts of the genome, we did not observe major differences in variant calling success within the regions that each covers. We observed substantial discrepancies between the five variant callers. All had high sensitivity, detecting known SNVs, but highly varying and non-overlapping false positive detections. Harmonizing variant caller parameters or intersecting the results of multiple variant callers reduced disagreements. However, intersecting results from biological replicates was even better at eliminating false positives.\n\nConclusionsReproducibility and accuracy of targeted clinical sequencing results depends less on sequencing platform and panel than on downstream bioinformatics and biological variability. Differences in variant callers default parameters are a greater influence on algorithm disagreement than other differences between the algorithms. Contrary to typical clinical practice, we recommend analyzing replicate samples, as this greatly decreases false positive calls.",

Comparison of the cell type-specific chromatin landscape of cerebral organoids to primary developing cortex found that organoids establish broad cell type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns similar to the developing cortex, but lack many putative regulatory elements identified in homologous primary cell types.

    "abstract": "Patterns of size variation in fish are supposed to be generated by growth differences, not by egg or hatchling size variation. However, annual killifish live in temporary ponds with a limited time period available for growth and reproduction. It has therefore been hypothesized that among annual killifish, hatchling size variation should be of large relative importance to generate adaptive adult size variation. Using growth curves of 203 individuals from 18 Austrolebias species raised in a common environment, we demonstrate that hatchling size variation indeed is a main determinant of adult size variation in annual killifish, in agreement with the time constraint hypothesis. Furthermore, we find an increased early growth rate in piscivorous species augmenting their difference in size from small congeneric species. This should be adaptive if size differences determine predation success. Environmental effects of spatial location of the population of origin on hatchling size and growth suggest that the time constraint might be weakened in populations occurring near the Atlantic coast.

    "abstract": "The full activation of NLRP3 inflammasome needs two sequential signals: the fist priming signal and the second assembly signal. Various stimuli including infections and stress signals can provide the assembly signal. However, how NLRP3 detects diverse stimuli and becomes fully activated remain largely unknown. In this study, we found the second signal specially triggers the acetylation of NLRP3, which facilitates the aggregation of NLRP3 and its interaction with ASC and NEK7, thus promoting the assembly of inflammasome. Meanwhile, by employing pharmacological and molecular approaches, we identified KAT5 as a regulator of NLRP3 acetylation and activation. Furthermore, KAT5 specific inhibitor-NU9056 exhibited a robust suppressive effect on NLRP3 inflammasome both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study reveals a new mechanism for NLRP3 full activation and suggests targeting NLRP3 acetylation may provide a new approach for treatment of NLRP3 associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements threaten genome integrity in all organisms. MUT-2/RDE-3 is a ribonucleotidyltransferase required for transposon silencing and RNA interference (RNAi) in C. elegans. When tethered to RNAs in heterologous expression systems, RDE-3 can add long stretches of alternating non-templated uridine (U) and guanosine (G) ribonucleotides to the 3 termini of these RNAs (polyUG or pUG tails). Here, we show that, in its natural context in C. elegans, RDE-3 adds pUG tails to transposon RNAs, as well as to targets of RNAi. pUG tails with more than 16 perfectly alternating 3 U and G nucleotides convert otherwise inert RNA fragments into agents of gene silencing. pUG tails promote gene silencing by recruiting RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs), which use pUG-tailed RNAs as templates to synthesize small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cycles of pUG RNA-templated siRNA synthesis and siRNA-directed mRNA pUGylation underlie dsRNA-directed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in the C. elegans germline. Our results show that pUG tails convert RNAs into transgenerational memories of past gene silencing events, which, we speculate, allow parents to inoculate progeny against the expression of unwanted or parasitic genetic elements.",

    "abstract": "Ants are expert navigators using multiple cues from multiple sensory modalities to navigate successfully. Here, we present the results of systematic studies of multimodal cue use in navigating wood ants, Formica rufa. Ants learnt to navigate to a feeder that was defined by an olfactory cue, visual cue and airflow presented together. When ants learnt to find a feeder that was placed in the centre of the visual cue, well-trained ants were not anymore able to accurately approach the feeder when either the olfactory or visual cue were removed in tests. This confirms that some form of cue binding has taken place. However, in a visually simpler task with the feeder located at the edge of the visual cue, ants still approached the feeder accurately when individual cue components were removed. Hence, cue binding is flexible and depends on the navigational context. In general, cues act additively in determining the ants paths accuracy, i.e. the use of multiple cues increased navigation performance. Moreover, across different training conditions, we saw different motor patterns in response to different sensory cues. For instance, ants had more sinuous paths with more turns when they followed an odour plume but did not have any visual cues. Having visual information with the odour enhanced performance and therefore positively impacted on plume following. Interestingly, paths characteristics of ants from the two multimodal groups with a different visual task were different, suggesting that the observed flexibility in cue binding may be a result of the ants movement characteristics.\n\nSummary statementWe investigated the impact of multimodal information on navigating ants. Ants showed flexible response to multimodal information depending on the sensori-motor contingencies of the navigation task.",

    "abstract": "HU is the most conserved nucleoid-associated protein in eubacteria and has been implicated as a key player in global chromosome organization. The mechanism of HU-mediated nucleoid organization, however, remains poorly understood. Using single molecule tracking coupled with genetic manipulations, we characterized the dynamics of HU in live Escherichia coli cells. We found that native HU dimers bind and unbind chromosomal DNAs weakly and transitorily across the entire nucleoid volume but remain nucleoid-localized, reminiscent of random diffusion in a liquid phase-separated, membrane-less \"macro-compartment\" distinct from the remaining cytosol. Mutating three key surface lysine residues of HU nearly entirely abolished the weak and transitory interactions of HU with DNA and led to severe cell growth and DNA segregation defects, suggesting the importance of HUs interactions with chromosomal DNA mediated by the positively charged surface. A conserved proline residue important for recognizing bent and cruciform DNAs such as that in recombination intermediates, similarly abolished HUs rapid and transitory DNA interaction dynamics but had little impact on its apparent binding stability with nonspecific chromosomal DNAs. Interestingly, the proline residue appeared to be important for HU{beta} dimer formation as mutating this residue makes HU{beta} behave similarly to HU2 dimers. Finally, we find that while prior evidence has found HU capable of depositing nucleoid-associated noncoding RNAs onto cruciform DNA structures, deletion of these specific naRNAs or inhibition of global transcription had a relatively minor effect on HU dynamics irrespective altered nucleoid compaction. Our results suggest a model of chromosome organization mediated by weak, transient interactions of HU, a substantial deviation from nucleoid-like proteins such as histones. Such collective sum of the numerous weak, transitory binding events of HU with nonspecific chromosome DNAs could generates a \"force\" to maintain a dynamic, fluid nucleoid with enough flexibility to rapidly facilitate global topological processes such as replication or nucleoid segregation.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) are used as gene therapy vectors to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Despite their safety and broad tropism, important issues need to be corrected such as the limited payload capacity and the lack of small gene promoters providing long-term, pan-neuronal transgene expression in the CNS. Commonly used gene promoters are relatively large and can be repressed a few months after CNS transduction, risking the long-term performance of single-dose gene therapy applications. We used a whole-CNS screening approach based on systemic delivery of AAV-PHP.eB, iDisco+ tissue-clearing and light-sheet microscopy, to identify three small latency-associated promoters (LAP) from the herpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV). These promoters are LAP1 (404bp), LAP2 (498bp) and LAP1_2 (880bp). They drive chronic transcription of the virus encoded latency-associated transcript (LAT) during productive and latent phases of PRV infection. We observed stable, pan-neuronal transgene transcription and translation from AAV-LAP in the CNS for six months post AAV transduction. In several CNS areas, the number of cells expressing the transgene was higher for LAP2 than the large conventional EF1 promoter (1264bp). Our data suggests that the LAP are suitable candidates for viral vector-based CNS gene therapies requiring chronic transgene expression after one-time viral-vector administration.",

    "abstract": "As the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), Alzheimers disease (AD) is thought to be caused mainly by the excessive aggregation of {beta}-amyloid protein (A{beta}). However, a growing number of studies have found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the onset and progression of AD. The present study aimed to probe the neuroprotective effect of high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) for SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and A{beta}-induced cytotoxicity. By looking in a systematic way into the frequency- and amplitude-dependent neuroprotective effect of pulsed electric field (PEF), the study finds that H-LIPEF at 200 Hz produces the optimal protective effect for SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanisms were confirmed to be due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the downstream prosurvival and antioxidant proteins. Because the electric field can be modified to focus on specific area in a non-contact manner, the study suggests that H-LIPEF holds great potential for treating NDDs, whose effect can be further augmented with the administering of drugs or natural compounds at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Efficient coding has been a successful organizational principle in neuroscience, but a more general theoretical framework needs to include the capacity for biological constraints to impede the realization of optimal circuit design. Here, we explore how evolution shapes the computational organization of a circuit using color vision as a model system. Taking a theoretical, machine learning approach allowed us to simulate the evolution of tetrachromatic color vision from a trichromatic ancestor both within and across distinct phylogenetic lineages. Analyzing network performance showed that trichromatic starting weights impose a significant constraint on learning rate, although the incremental increase in input layer complexity leads to better overall performance. Analyzing hidden layer computations showed that ancestry severely constrained evolution into a restricted and predictable portion of the theoretically available computational state space. Overall, our simulations of color vision evolution suggest that phylogenetic history is an important aspect of the functional organization of neural circuits.",

This enzyme is the target of the antibacterial drug triclosan and has been the subject of extensive studies for the past 20 years. Despite the large number of reports describing the biochemistry of this enzyme, there have been no studies that provided direct observation of the protein and its various ligands. Here we describe the use of native MS to characterize the protein-ligand interactions of FabI with its coenzymes NAD+ and NADH and with the inhibitor triclosan. Measurements of the gas-phase affinities of the enzyme for these ligands yielded values that are in close agreement with solution-phase affinity measurements. Additionally, FabI is a homotetramer and we were able to measure the affinity of each subunit for each coenzyme, which revealed that both coenzymes exhibit a positive homotropic allosteric effect. An allosteric effect was also observed in association with the inhibitor triclosan. These observations provide new insights into this well-studied enzyme and suggest that there may still be gaps in the existing mechanistic models that explain FabI inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Learning from experience depends at least in part on changes in neuronal connections. We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (L2/3 pyramidal cells), which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects. We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes (Arellano et al. 2007) by a log-normal distribution (Loewenstein, Kuras, and Rumpel 2011; de Vivo et al. 2017; Santuy et al. 2018). A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells, is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size (Sorra and Harris 1993; Koester and Johnston 2005; Bartol et al. 2015; Kasthuri et al. 2015; Dvorkin and Ziv 2016; Bloss et al. 2018; Motta et al. 2019). We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors, while analog variation may be dominated by other influences. We discuss the implications for the stability-plasticity dilemma.",

Although many molecular mechanisms controlling developmental processes are evolutionarily conserved, the speed at which these operate can vary substantially between species. For example, the same genetic programme, comprising sequential changes in transcriptional states, governs the differentiation of motor neurons in mouse and human, but the tempo at which it operates differs between species. Using in vitro directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells to motor neurons, we show that the programme runs twice as fast in mouse as in human. We provide evidence that this is neither due to differences in signalling, nor the genomic sequence of genes or their regulatory elements. Instead, we find an approximately two-fold increase in protein stability and cell cycle duration in human cells compared to mouse. This can account for the slower pace of human development, indicating that global differences in key kinetic parameters play a major role in interspecies differences in developmental tempo.",
