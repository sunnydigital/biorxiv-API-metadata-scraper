    "abstract": "The uneven distributions of species over geography (e.g., tropical versus temperate regions) and phylogeny (e.g., rodents and bats versus the aardvark) are prominent biological patterns for which causal interconnections remain enigmatic. Here we investigate this central issue for living mammals using time-sliced clades sampled from a comprehensive recent phylogeny (N=5,911 species, [~]70% with DNA) to assess how different levels of unsampled extinction impact the inferred causes of species richness variation. Speciation rates are found to strongly exceed crown age as a predictor of clade species richness at every time slice, rejecting a clock-like model in which the oldest clades are the most speciose. Instead, mammals that are low-vagility or daytime-active show the fastest recent speciation and greatest extant richness. This suggests primary roles for dispersal limitation leading to geographic speciation (peripatric isolation) and diurnal adaptations leading to ecological speciation (time partitioning). Rates of speciation are also faster in temperate than tropical lineages, but only among older clades, consistent with the idea that many temperate lineages are ephemeral. These insights, enabled by our analytical framework, offer straightforward support for ecological effects on speciation-rate variation among clades as the primary cause of uneven phylogenetic richness patterns.",

    "abstract": "Improving the consistency and reproducibility of bladder cancer prognoses necessitates the development of accurate, predictive prognostic models. Current methods of determining the prognosis of bladder cancer patients rely on manual decision-making, including factors with high intra- and inter-observer variability, such as tumor grade. To advance the long-term prediction of bladder cancer prognoses, we developed and tested a computational model to predict the 10-year overall survival outcome using population-based bladder cancer data, without considering tumor grade classification. The resulted predictive model demonstrated promising performance using a combination of clinical and molecular features, and was also strongly related to patient overall survival in Cox models. Our study suggests that machine learning methods can provide reliable long-term prognoses for bladder cancer patients, without relying on the less consistent tumor grade. If validated in clinical trials, this automated approach could guide and improve personalized management and treatment for bladder cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian odorant receptors are a diverse and rapidly evolving set of G protein-coupled receptors expressed in olfactory cilia membranes. Most odorant receptors show little to no cell surface expression in non-olfactory cells due to endoplasmic reticulum retention, which has slowed down biochemical studies. Here, we provide evidence that structural instability and divergence from conserved residues of individual odorant receptors underlie intracellular retention using a combination of large-scale screening of odorant receptors cell surface expression in heterologous cells, point mutations, structural modeling, and machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the importance of conserved residues by synthesizing \"consensus\" odorant receptors that show high levels of cell surface expression similar to conventional G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, we associate in silico structural instability with poor cell surface expression using molecular dynamics simulations. We propose an enhanced evolutionary capacitance of olfactory sensory neurons that enable the functional expression of odorant receptors with cryptic mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementOdor detection in mammals depends on the largest family of G protein-coupled receptors, the odorant receptors, which represent [~]2% of our protein-coding genes. The vast majority of odorant receptors are trapped within the cell when expressed in non-olfactory cells. The underlying causes of why odorant receptors cannot be functionally expressed in non-olfactory cells have remained enigmatic for over 20 years. Our study points to divergence from a consensus sequence as a key factor in a receptors inability to function in non-olfactory cells, which in turn, helps explain odorant receptors exceptional functional diversity and rapid evolution. We also show the success of protein engineering strategies for promoting odorant receptor cell surface expression.",

    "abstract": "The 1.6 Mbp deletion on chromosome 3q29 is associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Despite its importance towards neurodevelopment, the role of individual genes, genetic interactions, and disrupted biological mechanisms underlying the deletion have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we used quantitative methods to assay Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models with tissue-specific individual and pairwise knockdown of 14 homologs of genes within the 3q29 region. We identified developmental, cellular, and neuronal phenotypes for multiple homologs of 3q29 genes, potentially due to altered apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development. Using the fly eye, we screened for 314 pairwise knockdowns of homologs of 3q29 genes and identified 44 interactions between pairs of homologs and 34 interactions with other neurodevelopmental genes. Interestingly, NCBP2 homologs in Drosophila (Cbp20) and X. laevis (ncbp2) enhanced the phenotypes of homologs of the other 3q29 genes, leading to significant increases in apoptosis that disrupted cellular organization and brain morphology. These cellular and neuronal defects were rescued with overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitors Diap1 and xiap in both models, suggesting that apoptosis is one of several potential biological mechanisms disrupted by the deletion. NCBP2 was also highly connected to other 3q29 genes in a human brain-specific interaction network, providing support for the relevance of our results towards the human deletion. Overall, our study suggests that NCBP2-mediated genetic interactions within the 3q29 region disrupt apoptosis and cell cycle mechanisms during development.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRare copy-number variants, or large deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. The 3q29 deletion confers an increased risk for schizophrenia, autism, and microcephaly. To understand the conserved biological mechanisms that are disrupted by this deletion, we systematically tested 14 individual homologs and 314 pairwise interactions of 3q29 genes for neuronal, cellular, and developmental phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models. We found that multiple homologs of genes within the deletion region contribute towards developmental defects, such as larval lethality and disrupted cellular organization. Interestingly, we found that NCBP2 acts as a key modifier gene within the region, enhancing the developmental phenotypes of each of the homologs for other 3q29 genes and leading to disruptions in apoptosis and cell cycle pathways. Our results suggest that multiple genes within the 3q29 region interact with each other through shared mechanisms and jointly contribute to neurodevelopmental defects.",

    "abstract": "Genetic screens are powerful tools for the functional annotation of genomes. In the context of multicellular organisms, interrogation of gene function is greatly facilitated by methods that allow spatial and temporal control of gene abrogation. Here, we describe a large-scale transgenic short guide (sg) RNA library for efficient CRISPR-based disruption of specific target genes in a constitutive or conditional manner. The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1600 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4/UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption. Furthermore, we conducted the so far largest fully transgenic CRISPR screen in any metazoan organism, which further supported the high efficiency and accuracy of our library and revealed many so far uncharacterized genes essential for development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate network models of species interaction could be used to predict population dynamics and be applied to manage real world ecosystems. Most relevant models are nonlinear, however, and data available from real world ecosystems are too noisy and sparsely sampled for common inference approaches. Here we improved the inference of generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) ecological networks by using a new optimization algorithm to constrain parameter signs with prior knowledge and a perturbation-based ensemble method.\n\nResultsWe applied the new inference to long-term species abundance data from the freshwater fish community in the Illinois River, United States. We constructed an ensemble of 668 gLV models that explained 79% of the data on average. The models indicated (at a 70% level of confidence) a strong positive interaction from emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which we could validate using data from a nearby observation site, and predicted that the relative abundances of most fish species will continue to fluctuate temporally and concordantly in the near future. The network shows that the invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has much stronger impacts on native predators than on prey, supporting the notion that the invader perturbs the native food chain by replacing the diets of predators.\n\nConclusionsEnsemble approaches constrained by prior knowledge can improve inference and produce networks from noisy and sparsely sampled time series data to fill knowledge gaps on real world ecosystems. Such network models could aid efforts to conserve ecosystems such as the Illinois River, which is threatened by the invasion of the silver carp.",

    "abstract": "Polarized distribution of organelles and molecules inside a cell is vital for a range of cellular processes and its loss is frequently encountered in disease. Polarization during planar cell migration is a special condition in which cellular orientation is triggered by cell-cell contact. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-modular signaling scaffold Daple (CCDC88C) is a component of cell junctions in epithelial cells which serves like a cellular  compass for establishing and maintaining contact-triggered planar polarity via its interaction with the polarity regulator PARD3, which has been implicated in both apical-basal and planar polarity. This interaction, mediated by Daples PDZ-binding motif (PBM) and the third PDZ domain of PARD3, is fine-tuned by two tyrosine phosphoevents on Daples PBM that are known to be triggered by a multitude of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src. Hypophosphorylation strengthens the interaction, whereas hyperphosphorylation disrupts it. These findings reveal an unexpected role of Daple within the planar cell polarity pathway as a platform for signal integration and gradient sensing for tyrosine-based signals.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine C5 methylation is an important epigenetic control mechanism in a wide array of Eukaryotic organisms and generally carried out by proteins of C-5 DNA methyltransferase family (DNMTs). In several protozoans the status of this mechanism remains elusive, such as in Leishmania, the causative agent of the disease leishmaniasis in humans and a wide array of vertebrate animals. In this work, we show that the Leishmania donovani genome contains a C-5 DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) from the DNMT6 subfamily, of which the function is still unclear, and verified its expression at RNA level. We created viable overexpressor and knock-out lines of this enzyme and characterised their genome-wide methylation patterns using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, together with promastigote and amastigote control lines. Interestingly, despite DNMT6 presence, we found that methylation levels were equal to or lower than 0.0003% at CpG sites, 0.0005% at CHG sites and 0.0126% at CHH sites at genome scale. As none of the methylated sites were retained after manual verification, we conclude that there is no evidence for DNA methylation in this species. We demonstrate that this difference in DNA methylation between the parasite (no detectable DNA methylation) and the vertebrate host (DNA methylation), allows enrichment of parasite versus host DNA using Methyl-CpG-binding domain columns, readily available in commercial kits. As such, we depleted methylated DNA from mixes of Leishmania promastigote and amastigote DNA with human DNA, resulting in average Leishmania:human enrichments from 62x up to 263x. These results open a promising avenue for unmethylated DNA enrichment as a pre-enrichment step before sequencing Leishmania clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "Most well-studied bacteria have been domesticated to some extent. How fast can a natural isolate diverge from its ancestral phenotypes under domestication to a novel laboratory environment is poorly known. Yet such information is key to understand rates of evolution, the time scale at which a natural isolate can be propagated without loss of its natural adaptive traits and the reliability of experimental results across labs. Using experimental evolution, phenotypic assays and whole-genome sequencing, we show that within a week of propagation in a common laboratory environment, a natural isolate of Bacillus subtilis acquires mutations that cause changes in a multitude of traits. A single adaptive mutational step, in the gene coding for the transcriptional regulator DegU, impairs a DegU-dependent positive autoregulatory loop and leads to loss of robust biofilm architecture, impaired swarming motility, reduced secretion of exoproteases and changes in the dynamics of sporulation across environments. Importantly, domestication also resulted in improved survival when the bacteria face pressure from cells of the innate immune system. These results show that degU is a key target for mutations during domestication and also underscore the importance of performing careful and extremely short-term propagations of natural isolates to conserve the traits encoded in their original genomes.\n\nSummaryDomestication is the process by which organisms are selected to live in specific conditions and an important phenomenon that shapes the evolution and variation in many animals and plants. In microbes, domestication is also a key driver of adaptation. It can be beneficial, when improving microbes abilities that are important for biotechnology, but also problematic, especially when studying microbe-host interactions and the microbes natural behavior. Using a natural isolate of Bacillus subtilis, we determined the speed and genetic basis of microbial domestication using experimental evolution. Within one week of growth in the common laboratory media, mutations in the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator, DegU, emerge and spread in the populations. These lead to loss of social traits, increased resistance to bacteriophages and increased survival in the presence of macrophages. The data highlights the extreme caution that is needed when culturing natural microbial isolates and may help explain why some key microbial social traits and behaviors may differ between different laboratories, even when studying the same strains.",

However, it remains relatively unexplored in fresh-frozen brain which provides more flexible utilization than perfused tissue. In the present study, we optimized the combination of in situ hybridization chain reaction in fresh-frozen rodent brains and then evaluated the uniformity of neuronal labelling between two clearing methods, CLARITY and iDISCO+. We found that CLARITY yielded higher signal-to-noise ratios but more limited imaging depth and required longer clearing times, whereas, iDISCO+ resulted in better tissue clearing, greater imaging depth and a more uniform labelling of larger samples. Based on these results, we used iDISCO+-cleared fresh-frozen rodent brains to further validate this combination and map the expression of a few genes of interest pertaining to mood disorders. We then examined the potential of in situ hybridization chain reaction to label transcripts in cleared postmortem human brain tissues. The combination failed to produce adequate mRNA labelling in postmortem human cortical slices but produced visually adequate labeling in the cerebellum tissues. We next, investigated the multiplexing ability of in situ hybridization chain reaction in cleared tissues which revealed inconsistent fluorescence output depending upon the fluorophore conjugated to the hairpins. Finally, we applied our optimized protocol to assess the effect of glucocorticoid receptor overexpression on basal somatostatin expression in the mouse cortex. The constitutive glucocorticoid receptor overexpression resulted in lower number density of somatostatin-expressing neurons compared to wild type. Overall, the combination of in situ hybridization chain reaction with clearing methods especially iDISCO+ may find broad application in the transcript analysis in rodent studies but its limited use in postmortem human tissues can be improved by further optimizations.",

During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored.\n\nHere we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connICA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG-frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG-frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG.\n\nThe first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond-range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second-range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.",

    "abstract": "\"Mental travel\" is the ability to imagine oneself in different places and times and to adopt other peoples point of view (POV), also termed \"Theory of Mind (ToM)\". While ToM has been extensively investigated, self-projection with respect to ones own and others social networks has yet to be systematically studied.\n\nHere we asked participants to \"project\" themselves to four different POVs: a significant other, a non-significant other, a famous-person, and their own-self. From each POV they were asked to rate the level of affiliation (closeness) to different individuals in the respective social network while undergoing functional MRI.\n\nParticipants were always faster making judgments from their own POV compared to other POVs (self-projection effect) and for people who were personally closer to their adopted POV (self-reference effect). Brain activity at the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the self POV condition was found to be higher compared to all other conditions. Activity at the right temporoparietal junction and medial parietal cortex was found to distinguish between the personally related (self, significant- and non-significant others) and unrelated (famous-person) individuals within the social network. Regardless of the POV, the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction distinguished between relatively closer and distant people. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) implicated the left retrosplenial cortex as crucial for social distance processing across all POVs.",

In this paper, we develop a deep learning based framework to automatically segment the paracingulate sulcus (PCS) from the MRI scan and estimate lengths for its segments. The study is the first work on segmentation and characterisation of the PCS, and the model achieves a Dice score of over 0.77 on segmentation, which demonstrates its potential for clinical use to assist human annotation.

    "abstract": "The oomycete Phytophthora fragariae is a highly destructive pathogen of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), causing the root rotting disease,  red core. The host-pathogen interaction has a well described gene-for-gene resistance relationship, but to date neither candidate avirulence nor resistance genes have been identified. We sequenced a set of American, Canadian and UK isolates of known race type, along with three representatives of the closely related pathogen of the raspberry (Rubus idaeus), Phytophthora rubi, and found a clear population structure, with a high degree of nucleotide divergence seen between some race types and abundant private variation associated with race types 4 and 5. In contrast, between isolates defined as UK races 1, 2 & 3 (UK1-2-3) there was no evidence of gene loss or gain; or the presence of insertions/deletions (INDELs) or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within or in proximity to putative pathogenicity genes could be found associated with race variation. Transcriptomic analysis of representative UK1-2-3 isolates revealed abundant expression variation in key effector family genes associated with pathogen race; however, further long read sequencing did not reveal any long range polymorphisms to be associated with avirulence to race UK2 or UK3 resistance, suggesting either control in trans or other stable forms of epigenetic modification modulating gene expression. This work reveals the combined power of population resequencing to uncover race structure in pathosystems and in planta transcriptomic analysis to identify candidate avirulence genes. This work has implications for the identification of putative avirulence genes in the absence of associated expression data and points towards the need for detailed molecular characterisation of mechanisms of effector regulation and silencing in oomycete plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference is the process of narrowing down the hypotheses (causes) to the one that best explains the observational data (effects). To accurately estimate a cause, a considerable amount of data is required to be observed for as long as possible. However, the object of inference is not always constant. In this case, a method such as exponential moving average (EMA) with a discounting rate is used to improve the ability to respond to a sudden change; it is also necessary to increase the discounting rate. That is, a trade-off is established in which the followability is improved by increasing the discounting rate, but the accuracy is reduced. Here, we propose an extended Bayesian inference (EBI), wherein human-like causal inference is incorporated. We show that both the learning and forgetting effects are introduced into Bayesian inference by incorporating the causal inference. We evaluate the estimation performance of the EBI through the learning task of a dynamically changing Gaussian mixture model. In the evaluation, the EBI performance is compared with those of the EMA and a sequential discounting expectation-maximization algorithm. The EBI was shown to modify the trade-off observed in the EMA.",

    "abstract": "Taking leads from the fact that a handful of double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) interact with a massive number of topologically distinct double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in crucial biological pathways, and to understand the adaptability required by dsRBDs to target the pool of dsRNA substrates, we employed two independent model dsRBDs in an ITC and NMR spectroscopy based study. Our previous study revealed the presence of microsecond timescale dynamics in RNA-binding regions in the two dsRBDs studied. In the current study, results from ITC-based titrations showed that the binding of dsRBD with topologically distinct dsRNAs is enthalpy-driven, with each dsRNA-dsRBD pair having distinct combination of enthalpy-entropy yielding a similar change in free energy upon RNA-binding. We also show that the each of the dsRNA, used in this study, binds to the dsRBD in a unique mode. Further, intrinsic conformational exchange present in the RNA-binding regions of the apo-dsRBD was shown to quench upon binding with a dsRNA, while conformational exchange got induced at the residues that are in close proximity to where exchange was present in the apo-protein. This apparent relay of conformational exchange from one site to the other site upon dsRNA-binding thus suggests the importance of intrinsic dynamics to adapt to target a variety of dsRNA-shapes.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis study reports that the interaction between dsRBDs and dsRNAs is enthalpy-driven, is perturbed by subtle changes in dsRNA shapes, and exhibits a classic case of enthalpy-entropy compensation. Further, the intrinsic microsecond timescale conformational exchange present in the apo-dsRBD was observed to get quenched upon RNA-binding. An apparent relay of conformational exchange was also observed from quenched sites to spatially proximal sites upon RNA-binding, suggesting highly adaptive nature of the dsRBD, a critical feature required to target topologically distinct dsRNA.",

    "abstract": "1.1.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. During the formation of the coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC), essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease Mpro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsps. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2:2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) controls the homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and defects in the IL-2 pathway contribute to multiple autoimmune diseases. Although recombinant IL-2 therapy has been efficacious in certain inflammatory conditions, the capacity for IL-2 to also activate inflammatory effector responses highlights the need for IL-2-based therapeutics with improved Treg-specificity. From a panel of rationally designed IL-2 variants, we identified IL-2 muteins with reduced potency and enhanced Treg-selectivity due to increased dependence on the IL-2-receptor component CD25. As an Fc-fused homodimer, the optimal Fc.IL-2 mutein induced selective Treg enrichment and reduced agonism of effector cells across a wide dose range. Furthermore, despite being a weaker agonist, overall Treg growth was greater and more sustained due to reduced receptor-mediated clearance of the Fc.IL-2 mutein compared to Fc-fused wild-type IL-2. Preferential Treg enrichment was also observed in the presence of activated pathogenic T cells in the autoimmune target organ, despite a loss of Treg-selectivity in an IL-2R-proximal response. These features allowed for extended resolution of spontaneous autoimmunity using infrequent dosing schedules. Thus, IL-2 muteins enable efficient, flexible, and targeted control of the autoimmune response.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA CD25-dependent IL-2 mutein selectively expands regulatory T cells and provides potent and targeted control of autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Protein domains are highly conserved functional units of proteins. Because they carry functionally significant information, the majority of the coding disease variants are located on domains. Additionally, domains are specific units of the proteins that can be targeted for drug delivery purposes. Here, using information about variants sites associated with diseases, a disease network was built, based on their sharing the same domain and domain variation site. The result was 49,990 disease pairs linked by domain variant site and 533,687 disease pairs that share the same mutated domain. These pairs were compared to disease pairs made using previous methods such as gene identity and gene variant site identity, which revealed that over 8,000 of these pairs were not only missing from the gene pairings but also not found commonly together in literature. The disease network was analyzed from their disease subject categories, which when compared to the gene-based disease network revealed that the domain method results in higher number of connections across disease categories versus within a disease category. Further, a study into the drug repurposing possibilities of the disease network created using domain revealed that 16,902 of the disease pairs had a drug reported for one disease but not the other, highlighting the drug repurposing potential of this new methodology.",

Here, using X-ray crystallographic and electrophysiological studies of an RuR-sensitive K2P, K2P2.1 (TREK-1) I110D, we show that RuR acts by binding an acidic residue pair comprising the  Keystone inhibitor site under the K2P CAP domain archway above the channel pore. We further establish that Ru360, a dinuclear ruthenium amine not known to affect K2Ps, inhibits RuR-sensitive K2Ps using the same mechanism. Structural knowledge enabled a generalizable RuR  super-responder design strategy for creating K2Ps having nanomolar sensitivity. Together, the data define a  finger in the dam inhibition mechanism acting at a novel K2P inhibitor binding site.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving response to radiation is critical for identifying regulatory routes that could be targeted to improve treatment response.\n\nMethodsWe conducted an integrated analysis in the U251 and U343 glioblastoma cell lines to map early alterations in the expression of genes at three levels: transcription, splicing, and translation in response to ionizing radiation.\n\nResultsChanges at the transcriptional level were the most prevalent response. Downregulated genes are strongly associated with cell cycle and DNA replication and linked to a coordinated module of expression. Alterations in this group are likely driven by decreased expression of the transcription factor FOXM1 and members of the E2F family. Genes involved in RNA regulatory mechanisms were affected at the mRNA, splicing, and translation levels, highlighting their importance in radiation-response. We identified a number of oncogenic factors, with an increased expression upon radiation exposure, including BCL6, RRM2B, IDO1, FTH1, APIP, and LRIG2 and lncRNAs NEAT1 and FTX. Several of these targets have been previously implicated in radio-resistance. Therefore, antagonizing their effects post-radiation could increase therapeutic efficacy.\n\nConclusionsOur integrated analysis provides a comprehensive view of early response to radiation in glioblastoma. We identify new biological processes involved in altered expression of various oncogenic factors and suggest new target options to increase radiation sensitivity and prevent relapse.",

Calcium (Ca2+) is a vital secondary messenger in T lymphocytes regulating a vast array of important events including maturation, homeostasis, activation, and apoptosis and can enter the cell through CRAC, TRP, and Cav channels. Here we describe three Cav1.4-deficient siblings presenting with X-linked incomplete congenital stationary night blindness as well as an immune phenotype characterized by several recurrent infections. Complete exome sequencing demonstrated that the patients share only a single pathogenic allele; a R625X (p.Arg625Ter) point mutation that leads to a premature stop codon in the CACNA1F gene encoding the L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.4. The subjects uniformly exhibited an expansion of central and effector memory T lymphocytes, and evidence of T lymphocytes exhaustion with corresponding upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Moreover, the sustained elevated levels of activation markers on B lymphocytes suggest that they are in a chronic state of activation. Finally, the T lymphocytes from patients and CACNA1F knockdown Jurkat T lymphocytes exhibited a reduced Ca2+ flux, compared to controls. This is the first example where the mutation of any Cav channel causes a primary immunodeficiency in humans and establishes the physiological importance of Cav channels in the human immune system.",

Because viral HUH-tags are relatively small, react quickly, and require no chemical modifications to their ssDNA substrate, they have great value as protein fusion tags in biotechnologies ranging from genetic engineering to single-molecule studies. One of the greatest assets of these tags is sequence-specificity to their unique, native Ori sequence in vivo, introducing the possibility of using multiple HUH-tags in multiplexed \"one-pot\" reactions. However, their mechanism of ssDNA sequence binding and specificity is poorly understood, and there is noted cross-reactivity between tags of closely related species. In order to understand the mechanism of ssDNA binding, we performed an alanine scan along a positively-charged patch of one such HUH-tag, replication-associated protein from Wheat Dwarf Virus (WDV Rep), and characterized the enzymatic activity in both the rate and extent of the reaction. In molecular beacon Stopped-Flow experiments, single point mutants of WDV showed a more than 60% decrease in reaction rate constant, and gel shift assays showed an almost complete lack of activity for some variants for single nucleotide ssDNA substitutions. In all, these findings help allow us to highlight key interactions in WDV-ssDNA binding, and we gain further insight into potential rational engineering of HUH-endonucleases to bind desired sequences of DNA.",

    "abstract": "Engineering gene sequences with defined functional properties is a major goal of synthetic biology. Deep neural network models, together with gradient ascent-style optimization, show promise for sequence generation. The generated sequences can however get stuck in local minima, have low diversity and their fitness depends heavily on initialization. Here, we develop deep exploration networks (DENs), a type of generative model tailor-made for searching a sequence space to minimize the cost of a neural network fitness predictor. By making the network compete with itself to control sequence diversity during training, we obtain generators capable of sampling hundreds of thousands of high-fitness sequences. We demonstrate the power of DENs in the context of engineering RNA isoforms, including polyadenylation and cell type-specific differential splicing. Using DENs, we engineered polyadenylation signals with more than 10-fold higher selection odds than the best gradient ascent-generated patterns and identified splice regulatory elements predicted to result in highly differential splicing between cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Slo2 potassium channels play important roles in neuronal function, and their mutations in humans cause epilepsies and cognitive defects. However, little is known how Slo2 function is regulated by other proteins. Here we found that the function of C. elegans Slo2 (SLO-2) depends on adr-1, a gene important to RNA editing. However, slo-2 transcripts have no detectable RNA editing events and exhibit similar expression levels in wild type and adr-1 mutants. In contrast, mRNA level of scyl-1, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian SCYL1, is greatly reduced in adr-1 mutants due to deficient RNA editing at a single adenosine in its 3-UTR. SCYL-1 physically interacts with SLO-2 in neurons. Single-channel open probability of SLO-2 in neurons is reduced by [~]50% in scyl-1 knockout whereas that of human Slo2.2/Slack is doubled by SCYL1 in a heterologous expression system. These results suggest that SCYL-1/SCYL1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Slo2 channels.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish has recently emerged as a model system for investigating the developmental roles of glucocorticoid signaling and the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced developmental programming. To assess the role of the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) in such programming, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to produce a new frameshift mutation, GR369-, which eliminates all potential in-frame initiation codons upstream of the DNA binding domain. Using RNA-seq to ask how this mutation affects the larval transcriptome under both normal conditions and with chronic cortisol treatment, we find that GR mediates most of the effects of the treatment, and paradoxically, that the transcriptome of cortisol-treated larvae is more like that of larvae lacking a GR than that of larvae with a GR, suggesting that the cortisol-treated larvae develop GR resistance. The one transcriptional regulator that was both underexpressed in GR369- larvae and consistently overexpressed in cortisol-treated larvae was klf9. We therefore used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutation of klf9 and RNA-seq to assess Klf9-dependent gene expression in both normal and cortisol-treated larvae. Our results indicate that Klf9 contributes significantly to the transcriptomic response to chronic cortisol exposure, mediating the upregulation of proinflammatory genes that we reported previously.",

First, we report a 10-fold demographic decline of the Glanville fritillary butterfly metapopulation on the [A]land islands (Finland). Next, using climatic and satellite data we show that the summer of 2018 was an anomaly in terms of water balance and vegetation productivity indices across the habitats of the butterfly, and demonstrate that population growth rates are strongly associated with spatio-temporal variation in climatic water balance. Finally, we demonstrate that covariates that have previously been identified to impact the extinction probability of local populations in this system are less informative when populations are exposed to (severe) drought during the summer months. Our results highlight the unpredictable responses of natural populations to extreme climatic events.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDespite the general progress in using next generation sequencing techniques for evolutionary research questions, the analysis of polyploid species is still hampered by the lack of suitable analytical tools and the statistical difficulties of dealing with more than two alleles per locus. Polyploidization and especially allopolyploidy leads to new combinations of traits by combining genomes of two or more parental species. This enhances the adaptive potential and often results in speciation. However, multiple origins of polyploids, backcrossing to the parental species and post-origin evolution can strongly influence the genome composition of polyploid species. Here, we used RAD sequencing, which revealed 23,393 loci and 320,010 high quality SNPs, to analyze the relationships and origin of seven polyploid species of the diverse genus Salix by utilizing a phylogenomic and a network approach, as well as analyzing the genetic structure and composition of the polyploid genome in comparison to putative parental species. We adapted the SNiPloid pipeline that was originally developed to analyse SNP composition of recently established allotetraploid crop lineages to RAD sequencing data by using concatenated RAD loci as reference. Our results revealed a well-resolved phylogeny of 35 species of Eurasian shrub willows (Salix subg. Chamaetia/Vetrix), including 28 diploid and 7 polyploid species. Polyploidization in willows appears to be predominantly connected to hybridization, i.e. to an allopolyploid origin of species. More ancient allopolyploidization events involving hybridization of more distantly related, ancestral lineages were observed for two hexaploid and one octoploid species. Our data suggested a more recent allopolyploid origin for the included tetraploids within the major subclades and identified putative parental taxa that appear to be plausible in the context of geographical, morphological and ecological patterns. SNiPloid and HyDe analyses disentangled the different genomic signatures resulting from hybrid origin, backcrossing, and secondary post-origin evolution in the polyploid species. All tetraploids showed a considerable post-origin, species-specific proportion of SNPs. The amount of extant hybridization appears to be related to the degree of geographical and ecological isolation of species. Our data demonstrate that high-quality RAD sequencing data are suitable and highly informative for the analysis of the origin and relationships of polyploid species. The combination of the traditional tools RAxML, STRUCTURE, SplitsTree and recently developed programs like SNAPP, HyDe and SNiPloid established a bioinformatic pipeline for unraveling the complexity of polyploid genomes.",

To fully understand how environmental factors interact with genetic and stochastic factors to modulate the aging process, it is crucial to precisely control environmental conditions for long-term studies. In the commonly used model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, existing assays for healthspan and lifespan have inherent limitations, making it difficult to perform large-scale, longitudinal aging studies under precise environmental control. To address this constraint, we developed the Health and Lifespan Testing Hub (HeALTH), an automated, microfluidic-based system for robust, long-term, longitudinal behavioral monitoring. Our system provides spatiotemporal environmental control. We demonstrate health and lifespan studies under a variety of genetic and environmental perturbations while observing how individuality plays a role in the aging process. This system is generalizable beyond aging research for C. elegans, particularly for short- or long-term behavioral assays, and is also possible to be adapted for other model systems.",

    "abstract": "The within-host evolutionary dynamics of TB remain unclear, and underlying biological characteristics render standard population genetic approaches based upon the Wright-Fisher model largely inappropriate. In addition, the compact genome combined with an absence of recombination is expected to result in strong purifying selection effects. Thus, it is imperative to establish a biologically-relevant evolutionary framework incorporating these factors in order to enable an accurate study of this important human pathogen. Further, such a model is critical for inferring fundamental evolutionary parameters related to patient treatment, including mutation rates and the severity of infection bottlenecks. We here implement such a model and infer the underlying evolutionary parameters governing within-patient evolutionary dynamics. Results demonstrate that the progeny skew associated with the clonal nature of TB severely reduces genetic diversity and that the neglect of this parameter in previous studies has led to significant mis-inference of mutation rates. As such, our results suggest an underlying de novo mutation rate that is considerably faster than previously inferred, and a progeny distribution differing significantly from Wright-Fisher assumptions. This inference largely reconciles the seemingly contradictory observations of both rapid drug-resistance evolution but extremely low levels of genetic variation in both resistant and non-resistant populations.",

    "abstract": "Compared to prokaryotic cells, a typical eukaryotic cell is much more complex along with its endomembrane system and membrane-bound organelles. Although the endosymbiosis theories convincingly explain the evolution of membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, very little is understood about the evolutionary origins of the nucleus, the defining feature of eukaryotes. Most studies on nuclear evolution have not been able to take into consideration the underlying structural framework of the nucleus, attributed to the nuclear matrix (NuMat), a ribonucleoproteinaceous structure. This can largely be attributed to the lack of annotation of its core components. Since, NuMat has been shown to provide a structural platform for facilitating a variety of nuclear functions such as replication, transcription, and splicing, it is important to identify its protein components to better understand these processes. In this study, we address this issue using the developing embryos of D. melanogaster and D. rerio and identify 362 core NuMat proteins that are conserved between the two organisms. We find that of them, 132 protein groups have originated from pre-existing proteins in prokaryotes. While 51 were conserved across all eukaryotic supergroups, 17 new proteins evolved before the evolution of the last eukaryotic common ancestor and together these 68 proteins out of the 362 core conserved NuMat proteins are conserved across all eukaryotes indicating their indispensable nature for nuclear function for over 1.5 billion years of eukaryotic history. Our analysis paves the way to understand the evolution of the complex internal nuclear architecture and its functions.",

Here, we provide a detailed analysis of microRNA dynamics during pollen development and their genic and transposable element targets using small RNA and mRNA cleavage (PARE) high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore we uncover the microRNAs loaded in the two main Argonaute proteins in the mature pollen grain, AGO1 and AGO5. Our results indicate that the developmental progression from microspore to mature pollen grain is characterized by a reprogramming from microRNAs focused on the control of development to microRNAs regulating transposable element control.",

MB-GAN can automatically learn from a given dataset and compute simulated datasets that are indistinguishable from it. When MB-GAN was applied to a case-control microbiome study of 396 samples, we demonstrated that the simulated data and the original data had similar first-order and second-order properties, including sparsity, diversities, and taxa-taxa correlations.

    "abstract": "A mouse model to study the effect of cold-induced stress on Chlamydia muridarum genital infection and immune response has been developed in our laboratory. Our previous results show that cold-induced stress increases the intensity of chlamydia genital infection, but little is known about the effect of cold-induced stress on differentiations and activities of T cell subpopulations and bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). The factors that regulate the production of T helper 1 (Th1) or T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines is not clear. The objective of this study was to examine whether cold-induced stress modulates the expression of transcription factors and hallmark cytokines of Th1 and Th2 or differentiation of BMDCs during C. muridarum genital infection in mice. Our results show that mRNA level of beta2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2-AR) compared to {beta}1-AR and {beta}3-AR was high in mixed population of CD4+ T cells and BMDCs. Further, decreased expression of T-bet and low level of interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) production and increased expression of GATA-3 and interleukin-4 (IL-4) production in CD4+ T of stressed mice was observed. Exposure of BMDCs to feroterol ({beta}2-AR agonist) or ICI,118551 ({beta}2-AR antagonist), respectively, revealed significant stimulation or inhibition of {beta}2-AR in stressed mice. Moreover, co-culturing of mature BMDC and naive CD4+ T cells resulted in increased production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 in culture supernatants, suggesting that stimulation of {beta}2-AR leads to the increased production of Th2 cytokines. Overall, our results show for the first time that cold-induced stress is able to modulate the pattern of Th1 and Th2 cytokine environment, suggesting that it promotes the differentiation to Th2 rather than Th1 by the overexpression of GATA-3 correlated with elevated production of IL-4, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-17 in contrast to a low expression of T-bet correlated with less IFN-{gamma} secretion in the mouse model.",

    "abstract": "The archaeal cytoplasmic membrane provides an anchor for many surface proteins. Recently, a novel membrane anchoring mechanism involving a peptidase, archaeosortase A (ArtA) and C-terminal lipid attachment of surface proteins was identified in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. ArtA is required for optimal cell growth and morphogenesis, and the S-layer glycoprotein (SLG), the sole component of the H. volcanii cell wall, is one of the targets for this anchoring mechanism. However, how exactly ArtA function and regulation control cell growth and mor-phogenesis is still elusive. Here, we report that archaeal homologs to the bacterial phos-phatidylserine synthase (PssA) and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PssD) are involved in ArtA-dependent protein maturation. H. volcanii strains lacking either HvPssA or HvPssD exhibited motility, growth and morphological phenotypes similar to those of {triangleup}artA. Moreover, we showed the loss of covalent lipid attachment to SLG in the {triangleup}hvpssA mutant and that proteolytic cleavage of the ArtA substrate HVO_0405 was blocked in the {triangleup}hvpssA and {triangleup}hvpssD strains. Strikingly, ArtA, HvPssA, and HvPssD GFP-fusions co-localized to the mid position of H. volcanii cells, strongly supporting that they are involved in the same pathway. Finally, we have shown that the SLG is also recruited to the mid cell prior to being secreted and lipid-anchored at the cell outer surface. Collectively, our data suggest haloarchaea use the mid cell as the main surface processing hotspot for cell elongation, division and shape determination.",

We identified 4904 bacterial ASVs based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and determined significant changes in the composition responding mainly to the variables depth and salinity. A higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was observed in the surface waters and the lake tributaries. Cyanobacteria were more abundant in the deep chlorophyll maximum (28.5 to 128 m), while Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi were dominant at depths between 128 to 600 m. According to our machine learning analysis used for identifying the most critical environmental factors, depth and temperature revealed the strongest effect on members of Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Chloroflexi, while oxygen is associated with the variations in Cyanobacteria. Also, a notable increase in alpha diversity estimations was observed with increasing water depth. This work evidences significant differences in the structure of bacterial communities along the depth gradient in deep, transparent lake ecosystems. Notably, there is a dominance of Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi in the deepest layers, which can only be seen in a few other lakes with similar characteristics as Lake Issyk Kul and raises questions about their ecological role.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the nosocomial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, is becoming a serious public health threat. While some mechanisms of AMR have been reported, understanding novel mechanisms of resistance is critical for identifying emerging resistance. One of the first steps in identifying novel AMR mechanisms is performing genotype/phenotype association studies. However, performing genotype/phenotype association studies is complicated by the plastic nature of the A. baumannii pan-genome. In this study, we compared the antibiograms of 12 antimicrobials associated with multiple drug families for 84 A. baumannii isolates, many isolated in Arizona, USA. in silico screening of these genomes for known AMR mechanisms failed to identify clear correlations for most drugs. We then performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) looking for associations between all possible 21-mers; this approach generally failed to identify mechanisms that explained the resistance phenotype. In order to decrease the genomic noise associated with population stratification, we compared four phylogenetically-related pairs of isolates with differing susceptibility profiles. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on paired isolates and differentially expressed genes were identified. In these isolate pairs, we identified four different potential mechanisms, highlighting the difficulty of broad AMR surveillance in this species. To verify and validate differential expression, amplicon sequencing was performed. These results suggest that a diagnostic platform based on gene expression rather than genomics alone may be beneficial in certain surveillance efforts. The implementation of such advanced diagnostics coupled with increased AMR surveillance will potentially improve A. baumannii infection treatment and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Force produced during an isometric finger force production task tends to drift towards a lower magnitude when visual information is occluded. This phenomenon of drift in force without ones awareness is called unintentional drift. The present study used epilogue, a particular case of post-trial visual feedback, and compared the unintentional drift for two conditions, i.e., with and without the epilogue. For this purpose, fourteen healthy participants were recruited for the experiments and were instructed to produce fingertip forces using four fingers of the right hand with the target line at 15% MVC. A trial lasted for sixteen seconds, where for the initial eight seconds, there is visual feedback followed by the visual occlusion period. The results showed a significant reduction in unintentional drift for the condition involving epilogue when compared to no epilogue. This reduction in drift is due to the shift in the referent configuration parameter by the phenomenon of RC back coupling. Further, we also claim that there might be a distribution of {lambda}s or RCs, based on the history of tuning of the control parameter by the central controller. This distribution of {lambda}s selected by the central controller in a redundant environment based on the epilogue resulted in a reduction of unintentional drift.",

Source based morphometry was used to examine structural brain network alterations and their association with symptoms and cognitive performance. Two networks showed significant reductions in individuals with ADHD compared to unrelated healthy controls after False Discovery Rate correction. Component A, mainly located in bilateral Crus I, showed a case/control difference with sub-clinical cases being intermediate between cases and controls. The unaffected siblings were similar to controls. After correcting for IQ and medication status, component A showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms across the entire sample. Component B included a maximum cluster in the bilateral insula, where unaffected siblings, similar to cases, showed significantly reduced loadings compared to controls; but no relationship with individual symptoms or cognitive measures was found for component B. This multivariate approach suggests that areas reflecting genetic liability within ADHD are partly separate from those areas modulating symptom severity.",

Here, we report a computational design-driven strategy that is grounded in fundamental protein biophysics and which guides the experimental evaluation of a focused, sparse set of mutants--which vary in the degree of interfacial destabilization while preserving features such as stability and catalytic activity--to identify an optimal functional window. We validate our method by solving two distinct split protein design challenges, generating both broad insights and new technology platforms.

    "abstract": "In reverse vaccinology approaches, complete proteomes of bacteria are submitted to multiple computational prediction steps in order to filter proteins that are possible vaccine candidates. Most available tools perform such analysis only in a single strain, or a very limited number of strains. But the vast amount of genomic data had shown that most bacteria contain pangenomes, i.e. their genomic information contains core, conserved genes, and random accessory genes specific to each strain. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to define core proteins, and also core epitopes, in reverse vaccinology methods. EpitoCore is a decision-tree pipeline developed to fulfill that need. It provides surfaceome prediction of proteins from related strains, defines clusters of core proteins within those, calculate the immunogenicity of such clusters, predicts epitopes for a given set of MHC alleles defined by the user, and then reports if epitopes are located extracellularly and if they are conserved among the core homologues. Pipeline performance is illustrated by mining peptide vaccine candidates in Mycobacterium avium hominissuis strains. From a total proteome of approximately 4,800 proteins per strain, EpitoCore mined 103 highly immunogenic core homologues located at cell surface, many of those related to virulence and drug resistance. Conserved epitopes identified among these homologues allows the users to define sets of peptides with potential to immunize the largest coverage of tested HLA alleles using peptide-based vaccines. Therefore, EpitoCore is able to provide automated identification of conserved epitopes in bacterial pangenomic datasets.",

Persistence of IgM antibodies has been identified for other viruses belonging to the same family as ZIKV. We investigated, therefore, the presence of anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies in children with microcephaly born between January 2015 and November 2018, and their parents. We have detected persistence of IgM in 22% of children with microcephaly up to four years after primary infection. Long term IgM persistence have implications for the diagnosis of acute infection. More investigation is needed in order to correctly construe the significance of anti-ZIKV IgM persistence in the population in general, and in children with microcephaly in particular. The dynamics of IgM antibody responses against ZIKV must be known and understood to avoid misinterpretation of diagnosis for acute infection, re-infection and antibody persistence.",

Linking specific sets of neuronal responses with perception and behavior is essential for understanding mechanisms of neural circuit computation. We trained mice to perform visual detection tasks and used optogenetic perturbations to increase or decrease neuronal spiking primary visual cortex (V1). Perceptual reports were always enhanced by increments in V1 spike counts and impaired by decrements, even when increments and decrements were delivered to the same neuronal populations. Moreover, detecting changes in cortical activity depended on spike count integration rather than instantaneous changes in spiking. Recurrent neural networks trained in the task similarly relied on increments in neuronal activity when activity was costly. This work clarifies neuronal decoding strategies employed by cerebral cortex to translate cortical spiking into percepts that can be used to guide behavior.",

Furthermore, while alterations have been identified in both male and female individuals, neuroanatomy in female rodent models has not been assessed. We identified structural differences in regions that are also altered in FXS in male and female rat models, including the splenium of the corpus callosum. Interestingly, different sets of regions were disrupted in male and female rat models and, remarkably, male rats had higher brain-wide diffusion than female rats overall. We found reduced axonal caliber in the splenium, offering a mechanism for its structural changes. Our results provide insight into which brain regions are vulnerable to a loss of Fmr1 expression and suggest a potential mechanism for how its loss causes white matter dysfunction in FXS.",

    "abstract": "People are eager to know and recast the self in the eyes of others, even at a personal cost. However, it remains unknown what drives people to pursue costly evaluations of the self. Here, we propose that the evaluation of the self is valuable and that such subjective value placed on evaluation drives the costly-to-know behavior. By measuring the amount of money that individuals would forgo for the opportunity to know evaluations from other people (social evaluation) or a computer program (non-social evaluation), we quantified the subjective value individuals assigned to the evaluation on the self. The results from 5 studies (n = 375) lent cognitive and computational support for this hypothesis. Furthermore, the subjective value was modulated by the source and valence of the evaluation. Participants equally valued positive and negative non-social evaluations, characterized by a shared unknown aversion computation. However, individuals computed independent unknown aversion towards positive and negative social evaluations and placed a higher value on the opportunity to know another persons evaluation on positive than negative aspects. Such a valence-dependent valuation of the social evaluation was facilitated by oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to linked to social feedback learning and valuation processes, which decreased the value ascribed to negative social evaluation. Taken together, the current study reveals the psychological and computational processes underlying self-image formation and updating and suggests a role of oxytocin in modulating the value of social evaluation.",

WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations, and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with multiple cell type datasets with high dropout rates. Overall, this study demonstrates a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their scRNA-seq datasets.",

In this study, we discover that Aurora kinases are synergistic determinants of a switch from the proliferative cell cycle to polyploid growth and multinucleation in lung cancer cell lines. When Aurora kinases are inhibited together, lung cancer cells uniformly grow into PP/MN giant cells. These cells have adopted an endocycle in which the genome replicates, mitosis is omitted and cells grow in size. Consequently, such cells continue to safely grow in the presence of antimitotic agents.

Among others, we observed regulation of the ABCB1 (MDR1) gene in the W1PR1 cell line by miR-363 and regulation of the COL3A1 gene in the W1TR cell line by miR-29a.\n\nHence, on the basis of our findings, results indicate that genes responsible for drug resistance development in ovarian cancer can be regulated by miRNA.",

Capping Protein (CP) is central regulator of actin dynamics in all eukaryotes. It binds actin filament (F-actin) barbed ends with high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics to prevent filament polymerization and depolymerization. In cells, however, CP displays remarkably rapid dynamics within F-actin networks, but the underlying mechanism has remained enigmatic. We report that a conserved cytoskeletal regulator, twinfilin, is responsible for CPs rapid dynamics and specific localization in cells. Depletion of twinfilin led to stable association of CP with cellular F-actin arrays and its treadmilling throughout leading-edge lamellipodium. These were accompanied by diminished F-actin disassembly rates. In vitro single filament imaging approaches revealed that twinfilin directly promotes dissociation of CP from filament barbed ends, while allowing subsequent filament depolymerization. These results uncover an evolutionary conserved bipartite mechanism that controls how actin cytoskeleton-mediated forces are generated in cells.",

The modulation of these patterns by odorant interactions at ORs potentially explains several olfactory phenomena: mixture suppression, unpredictable sensory outcomes, and the perception of odorant mixtures as unique objects. We determined OR response patterns to 4 odorants and 3 binary mixtures in vivo in mice, identifying 30 responsive ORs. These patterns typically had a few strongly responsive ORs and a greater number of weakly responsive ORs. The ORs responsive to an odorant were often unrelated sequences distributed across several OR subfamilies. Mixture responses predicted pharmacological interactions between odorants, which were tested in vitro by heterologous expression of ORs in cultured cells. These tests provided independent evidence confirming odorant agonists for 13 ORs and identified both suppressive and additive effects of mixing odorants. This included 11 instances of antagonism of ORs by an odorant, 1 instance of additive responses to a binary mixture, 1 instance of suppression of a strong agonist by a weak agonist, and the discovery of an inverse agonist for an OR. These findings demonstrate that interactions between odorants at ORs are common.",

This depends not only on how many partners plant species share, but also by multiple intertwined factors like the plant species abundance, visitation, or traits. These factors inherently operate at the community level. However, most of our understanding of how these factors may affect the pollination service is based on systems of up to a handful of species. By examining comprehensive empirical data in eleven natural communities, we show here that the pollination service is--surprisingly--only partially influenced by the number of shared pollinators. Instead, the factors that most influence the pollination service (abundance and visit effectiveness) also introduce a trade-off between the absolute amount of conspecific pollen received and the amount relative to heterospecific pollen. Importantly, the ways plants appear to balance these trade-offs depend strongly on the community context, as most species showed flexibility in the strategy they used to cope with competition for pollination.",

    "abstract": "Selective attention can be directed not only to external sensory inputs, but also to internal sensory representations held within visual working memory (VWM). To date, this has been studied predominantly following retrospective cues directing attention to particular items, or their locations in memory. In addition to item-level attentional prioritisation, recent studies have shown that selectively attending to feature dimensions in VWM can also improve memory recall performance. However, no study to date has directly compared item-based and feature-based attention in VWM, nor their neural bases. Here, we compared the benefits of retrospective cues (retro-cues) that were directed either at a multi-feature item or at a feature-dimension that was shared between two spatially segregated items. Behavioural results revealed qualitatively similar attentional benefits in both recall accuracy and response time, but also showed that cueing benefits were larger following item cues. Concurrent EEG measurements further revealed a similar attenuation of posterior alpha oscillations following both item and feature retro-cues when compared to non-informative, neutral retro-cues. We argue that attention can act flexibly to prioritise the most relevant information - at either the item or the feature-level - to optimise ensuing memory-based task performance, and we discuss the implications of the observed commonalities and differences between item-level and feature-level prioritisation in VWM.",

However, compound responses can occur through many distinct phenotypic outcomes including changes in cell growth, apoptosis, and non-apoptotic cell death. These outcomes have distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment, immune responses, and resistance mechanisms. Here, we show that quantifying cell viability alone is insufficient to distinguish between these compound responses. Using an alternative assay and drug response analysis amenable to high-throughput measurement, we find that compounds with identical viability outcomes can have very different effects on cell growth and death. Moreover, compound pairs with additive cell growth and death effects can appear synergistic when only assessed by viability.

However, the role of forces arising from mechanical coupling of sister kinetochore fibers with bridging fibers in chromosome alignment is unknown. Here we develop an optogenetic approach for acute removal of PRC1 to disassemble bridging fibers, and show that they promote chromosome alignment. Tracking of the plus-end protein EB3 revealed longer antiparallel overlaps of bridging microtubules upon PRC1 removal, which was accompanied by misaligned and lagging kinetochores. Kif4A/kinesin-4 and Kif18A/kinesin-8 were found within the bridging fiber and lost upon PRC1 removal, suggesting that these proteins regulate the overlap length of bridging microtubules. We propose that PRC1-mediated crosslinking of bridging microtubules and recruitment of kinesins to the bridging fiber promotes chromosome alignment by overlap length-dependent forces transmitted to the associated kinetochores fibers.",

Information on NAT2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in South African population is limited. We investigated NAT2 polymorphisms and their effect on isoniazid pharmacokinetics in Zulu black HIV-infected South Africans in Durban, South Africa. Methods: HIV-infected participants with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled from two unrelated studies. Culture-confirmed participants were genotyped for NAT2 polymorphisms 282C>T, 341T>C, 481C>T, 857G>A, 590G>A and 803A>G using Life Technologies pre-validated Taqman assays (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Participants underwent sampling for determination of plasma isoniazid and N-acetylisoniazid concentrations.\n\nResultsAmongst the 120 patients, 63/120 (52.5%) were slow metabolisers (NAT2*5/*5), 43/120 (35.8%) had intermediate (NAT2*5/12), and 12/120 (11.7%) had rapid genotype (NAT2*4/*11, NAT2*11/12 and NAT2*12/12). NAT2 alleles in this study were *4, *5C, *5D, *5E, *5J, *5K, *5KA, *5T, *11A, *12A/12C and *12M. NAT2*5 was the most frequent allele (70.4%) followed by NAT2*12 (27.9%). 34/40 had both PK results and NAT2 genotyping results. The median area under the concentration-time-curve to infinity (AUC0-{infty}) interquartile range (IQR) was 7.81 (5.87 - 16.83) g/ml/hr and maximum concentration (Cmax) 3.14 g/ml (2.42 - 4.36) g/mL. Individual polymorphisms were not equally distributed, with some represented in small numbers. Genotype did not correlate with phenotype, rapid genotype showing higher AUC0-{infty} than slow but not significant, p=0.43.\n\nConclusionThere was high prevalence of slow followed by intermediate then rapid acetylator genotypes. The poor concordance between genotype and phenotype suggests that other factors or genetic loci influence INH metabolism, and warrants further investigation in this population.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing has enabled sequencing of native RNA molecules without conversion to cDNA, thus opening the gates to a new era for the unbiased study of RNA biology. However, a formal barcoding protocol for direct sequencing of native RNA molecules is currently lacking, limiting the efficient processing of multiple samples in the same flowcell. A major limitation for the development of barcoding protocols for direct RNA sequencing is the error rate introduced during the base-calling process, especially towards the 5 and 3 ends of reads, which complicates sequence-based barcode demultiplexing. Here, we propose a novel strategy to barcode and demultiplex direct RNA sequencing nanopore data, which does not rely on base-calling or additional library preparation steps. Specifically, custom DNA oligonucleotides are ligated to RNA transcripts during library preparation. Then, raw current signal corresponding to the DNA barcode is extracted and transformed into an array of pixels, which is used to determine the underlying barcode using a deep convolutional neural network classifier. Our method, DeePlexiCon, implements a 20-layer residual neural network model that can demultiplex 93% of the reads with 95.1% specificity, or 60% of reads with 99.9% specificity. The availability of an efficient and simple barcoding strategy for native RNA sequencing will enhance the use of direct RNA sequencing by making it more cost-effective to the entire community. Moreover, it will facilitate the applicability of direct RNA sequencing to samples where the RNA amounts are limited, such as patient-derived samples.",

The tower-building behavior of red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, presents a key example of this phenomenon of collective construction. While biological studies of collective construction focus on behavioral assays to measure the dynamics of formation and studies of swarm robotics focus on developing hardware that can assemble and interact, algorithms for designing such collective aggregations have been mostly overlooked. We address this gap by formulating an agent-based model for collective tower-building with a set of behavioral rules that incorporate local sensing of neighboring agents. We find that an attractive force makes tower building possible. Next, we explore the trade-offs between attraction and random motion to characterize the dynamics and phase transition of the tower building process. Lastly, we provide an optimization tool that may be used to design towers of specific shapes, mechanical loads, and dynamical properties such as mechanical stability and mobility of the center of mass.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are pervasive entities in the biosphere with significant impact in human health and economically important livestock. As strict cellular parasites, RNA viruses abuse host resources, redirecting them towards viral replication needs. Taking control of the cellular apparatus for protein production is a requirement for virus progression and diverse strategies of cellular mimicry and/or ribosome hijacking evolved to ensure this control. Especially in complex eukaryotes, translation is a sophisticated process, with multiple mechanisms acting on ribosomes and mRNAs. The initiation stage of translation is specially regulated, involving multiple steps and the engagement of numerous initiation factors some of them of high complexity. The use of structured RNA sequences, called Internal Ribosomal Entry Sites (IRES), in viral RNAs is a widespread strategy for the exploitation of eukaryotic initiation. Using a combination of electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and reconstituted translation initiation assays with native components, we characterized how a novel IRES at the 5-UTR of a viral RNA assembles a functional translation initiation complex via an uAUG intermediate, redirecting the cellular machinery for protein production towards viral messengers. The IRES features a novel extended, multi-domain architecture, circling the 40S head, leveraging ribosomal sites not previously described to be exploited by any IRES. The structures and accompanying functional data, illustrate the importance of 5-UTR regions in translation regulation and underline the relevance of the untapped diversity of viral IRESs. Given the large number of new viruses metagenomic studies have uncovered, the quantity and diversity of mechanisms for translation hijacking encrypted in viral sequences may be seriously underestimated. Exploring this diversity could reveal novel avenues in the fight against these molecular pathogens.",

As such, a molecular understanding of human monocyte-Toxoplasma interactions can expedite the development of novel human toxoplasmosis control strategies. Current molecular studies on monocyte-Toxoplasma interactions are based on average cell or parasite responses across bulk cell populations. Although informative, population-level averages of monocyte responses to Toxoplasma have sometimes produced contradictory results, such as whether CCL2 or IL12 define effective monocyte response to the parasite. Here, we used single-cell dual RNA sequencing (scDual-Seq) to comprehensively define, for the first time, the monocyte and parasite transcriptional responses that underpin human monocyte-Toxoplasma encounters at the single cell level. We report extreme transcriptional variability between individual monocytes. Furthermore, we report that Toxoplasma-exposed and unexposed monocytes are transcriptionally distinguished by a reactive subset of CD14++CD16- monocytes. Functional cytokine assays on sorted monocyte populations show that the infection-distinguishing monocytes secrete high levels of chemokines, such as CCL2 and CXCL5. These findings uncover the Toxoplasma-induced monocyte transcriptional heterogeneity and shed new light on the cell populations that largely define cytokine and chemokine secretion in human monocytes exposed to Toxoplasma.",

    "abstract": "Correctly predicting features of protein structure and function from amino acid sequence alone remains a supreme challenge for computational biology. For almost three decades, state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments. Exponentially growing sequence databases make it infeasible to gather evolutionary information for entire microbiomes or meta-proteomics. On top, for many important proteins (e.g. dark proteome and intrinsically disordered proteins) evolutionary information remains limited. Here, we introduced a novel approach combining recent advances of Language Models (LMs) with multi-task learning to successfully predict aspects of protein structure (secondary structure) and function (cellular component or subcellular localization) without using any evolutionary information from alignments. Our approach fused self-supervised pre-training LMs on an unlabeled big dataset (UniRef50, corresponding to 9.6 billion words) with supervised training on labelled high-quality data in one single end-to-end network. We provided a proof-of-principle for the novel concept through the semi-successful per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure and through per-protein predictions of localization (Q10=69%) and the distinction between integral membrane and water-soluble proteins (Q2=89%). Although these results did not reach the levels obtained by the best available methods using evolutionary information from alignments, these less accurate multi-task predictions have the advantage of speed: they are 300-3000 times faster (where HHblits needs 30-300 seconds on average, our method needed 0.045 seconds). These new results push the boundaries of predictability towards grayer and darker areas of the protein space, allowing to make reliable predictions for proteins which were not accessible by previous methods. On top, our method remains scalable as it removes the necessity to search sequence databases for evolutionary related proteins.",

Here, we investigated the impact of surfactin production on biofilm formation of B. subtilis using the laboratory model systems; pellicle formation at the air-medium interface and architecturally complex colony development, in addition to plant root-associated biofilms. We found that the production of surfactin by B. subtilis is not essential for pellicle biofilm formation neither in the well-studied strain, NCIB 3610, nor in the newly isolated environmental strains, but lack of surfactin reduces colony expansion. Further, plant root colonization was comparable both in the presence or absence of surfactin synthesis. Our results suggest that surfactin-related biocontrol and plant promotion in B. subtilis strains are independent of biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown that under viewing conditions that break retinal mechanisms for color, one class of objects appears paradoxically colored: faces, and they look green. Interpreted within a Bayesian-observer framework, this observation makes the surprising prediction that face-selective neurons are sensitive to color and weakly biased for colors that elicit L>M cone activity (warm colors). We tested this hypothesis by measuring color-tuning responses of face-selective cells in alert macaque monkey, using fMRI-guided microelectrode recording of the middle and anterior face patches and carefully color-calibrated stimuli. The population of face-selective neurons showed significant color tuning when assessed using images that preserved the luminance contrast relationships of the original face photographs. A Fourier analysis of the color-tuning responses uncovered two components. The first harmonic was biased towards the L>M colors, consistent with the prediction. Interestingly, the second harmonic aligned with the S-cone cardinal axis, which may relate to the computation of animacy by IT cells.\n\nSignificanceThe results provide the first quantitative measurements of the color tuning properties of face-selective neurons. The results provide insight into the neural mechanisms that could support the role of color in face perception.",

    "abstract": "The Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 2 NOVA2 protein is a major factor regulating neuron specific alternative splicing, previously associated with an acquired neurologic condition, the paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia (POMA). We report here six individuals with de novo frameshift variants in the NOVA2 gene affected with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability (ID), motor and speech delay, autistic features, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, spasticity or ataxic gait and abnormal brain MRI. The six variants lead to the same reading frame, adding a common 133 aa long proline rich C-terminus part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain. We detected forty-one genes differentially spliced after NOVA2 inactivation in human neural cells. The mutant NOVA2 protein shows decreased ability to bind a target RNA, to regulate specific splicing events and to rescue the phenotype of altered retinotectal axonal pathfinding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebrafish. Our results suggest a partial loss-of-function mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a specific contribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded on the basis of the genetic findings.",

    "abstract": "The means by which animals assess potential mates is an important issue in studies of reproductive systems. I tested whether an individuals previous experiences and the relatedness of mates affected mating behavior in a simultaneous hermaphrodite snail, Physa gyrina. Previous work with this species showed reduced reproductive success resulting from both strong outbreeding and inbreeding. Thus, I predicted that individuals should prefer partners of intermediate relatedness. During activity trials, snails moved longer distances when exposed to chemical cues from conspecifics of lesser relatedness. Furthermore, during mating interactions, behavioral responses to relatedness varied with gender-role: male-role behaviors did not vary across relatedness treatments, while snails paired with either closely related or highly dissimilar partners increased their female-role resistance behaviors as interactions escalated. Experiences with their current partner also affected behavioral dynamics. Familiar pairs had fewer matings and longer latency times until a mating occurred than unfamiliar pairs. Snails acting in the female role also exhibited higher resistance rates in familiar pairs than in unfamiliar pairs. Previous, brief exposure to chemical cues in a non-mating context also influenced behavior during a subsequent mating interaction. Snails that were previously exposed to chemical cues from unfamiliar individuals tended to be more likely to occupy the male role following an encounter, and had significantly lower copulation frequencies and higher female-role resistance rates (i.e. were choosier) than those previously exposed to cues from familiar individuals. Overall, the results show that: 1) relatedness, past exposure to conspecific chemical cues, and experience with a current partner all influence mating behaviors in these snails; and 2) in these simultaneous hermaphrodites, an individuals responses depend on whether it is occupying the male or female role.",

Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems.\n\nAuthor summaryThe dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new \"systems-informed neural network\" to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.",

However, the proportion of phenotypic variance which can be explained by the identified genetic variants is relatively low, leading to the \"missing heritability\" problem. This problem may be partly caused by the inadequate understanding of the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases. Here, we propose the additive epistatic interaction model, consisting of widespread pure epistatic interactions whose effects are additive and can be summarized by a genetic risk score. Based on a simulated genotype dataset, the additive epistatic interaction model well depicted genetic risks and hereditary patterns of complex diseases. Based on the 1000 Genomes Project data, the additive epistatic interaction model accurately classified human populations. Moreover, the models genetic risk score can be replaced by a deep learning model which is more resistant to noises. We suggest that the additive epistatic interaction model may help to understand the genetic mechanisms and risks of complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The cell energy metabolism is a multifactorial and evolving process that we address with a theoretical approach in order to decipher the functioning of the core system of the glycolysis-OXPHOS relationship. The model is based on some key experimental observations and well established facts. It emphasizes the role of lactate as a substrate, as well as the central role of pyruvate in the regulation of the metabolism. The simulations show how imposed environmental constraints and imposed energy requirements push the cell to adapt its metabolism to sustain its needs. The results highlight the cooperativeness of the two metabolic modes and allows to revisit the notions of metabolic switch and metabolic reprogramming. Our results thus tend to show that the Warburg effect is not an inherent characteristic of the tumor cell, but a spontaneous and transitory adaptation mechanism to a disturbed environment. This means that the tumor cell metabolism is not fundamentally different from that of a normal cell. This has implications on the way therapies are being considered. The quest to normalize the tumor acidity could be a good strategy.\n\nAuthor SummaryCancer cells metabolism focuses the interest of the cancer research community. Although this process is intensely studied experimentally, there exists very few theoretical models that tackle this issue. One main reason is the extraordinary complexity of the metabolism that involves many inter-related regulation networks which makes it illusory to recreate computationally this complexity. In this study we propose a simplified model of the metabolism which focuses on the interrelation of the three main energetic metabolites that are oxygen, glucose and lactate with the aim to better understand the dynamic of the core system of the glycolysis-OXPHOS relationship. However simple, the model highlights the main rules that allow the cell to dynamically adapt its metabolism to its changing environment. It moreover allows to address this impact at the tissue scale. Simulations performed in a spheroid exhibit non-trivial spatial heterogeneity of the energy metabolism. It further reveals that the metabolic features that are commonly assigned to cancer cells are not necessarily due to cell intrinsic abnormality. They can emerge spontaneously because of the disregulated over-acidic environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is vital to share details of concrete experiences of conducting a nationwide survey, so that the global health community could adapt it to expand geographic mapping programs, eventually contributing to the development of control and elimination strategies with limited resources. A nationwide survey of schistosomiasis and nine other intestinal helminthiases was conducted from December 2016 to March 2017 in Sudan.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to describe details of the key activities and components required for the nationwide survey of schistosomiasis and other intestinal helminthiases and to analyze its costs.\n\nMethodsWe estimated financial and economic costs from the providers perspective. Cash expenditures incurred to implement the survey were defined as financial costs. We took into account all of the resources invested in the survey for economic costs, including the components that were not paid for, such as vehicles and survey equipment provided by the Ministry of Health, Sudan and the opportunity costs of primary school teachers time spent on the survey. We ran one-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses using Monte-Carlo methods with 10,000 draws to examine the robustness of the primary analysis results.\n\nResultsA total of USD 1,465,902 and USD 1,516,238 was incurred for the financial and economic costs, respectively. The key cost drivers of the nationwide survey were personnel and transportation, for both financial and economic costs. Personnel and transportation accounted for around 64% and 18% of financial costs, respectively.\n\nConclusionsThe cost is expected to vary depending on the quantity and quality of existing laboratory facilities, equipment, and consumables, and the capability of laboratory technicians and sample collectors. Establishing central-level and independent supervision mechanisms to ensure the quality of the survey is equally important. We expect the global health community to draw on this study when developing nationwide surveys of schistosomiasis and other intestinal helminthiases.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough large-scale mapping of schistosomiasis and other intestinal helminthiases has been conducted in some countries, little is known about the details of nationwide surveys, such as the necessary scale of the workforce, logistics, and the cost of conducting a nationwide survey. A nationwide survey of schistosomiasis and nine other intestinal helminthiases was conducted from December 2016 to March 2017 in Sudan. A total of 105,167 students participated in the survey from 1,772 primary schools in 183 districts of all 18 states of Sudan. Herein, we present the activities that were necessary to prepare and conduct a nationwide neglected tropical disease survey, along with details on the types and amounts of personnel, survey equipment, and consumables that are required. In addition, through an analysis of the costs of the nationwide survey, we generated average costs at the district and sub-district level. The key cost drivers were personnel and transportation, both of which were recurrent costs. Establishing a steering committee to develop and reach consensus on a survey protocol, assessing the capacities of potential staff (particularly laboratory technicians), and training laboratory technicians and data collectors were key components required to prepare a nationwide survey. If a government finds a way to mobilize existing government officials with no additional payment using the health system already in place, the cost of a nationwide survey would be remarkably lower. We expect the global health community to draw on this study to develop nationwide surveys for schistosomiasis and other intestinal helminthiases.",

    "abstract": "The HSP70 family of chaperones are the front-line of protection from stress-induced misfolding and aggregation of polypeptides in most organisms and are responsible for promoting the stability, folding, and degradation of clients to maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Here we demonstrate quantitative identification of HSP70 and HSC70 clients using an ubiquitin-mediated proximity tagging strategy and show that, despite their high degree of similarity, these enzymes have largely non-overlapping specificities. Both proteins show a preference for association with newly synthesized polypeptides but each responds differently to changes in the stoichiometry of proteins in obligate multi-subunit complexes. In addition, expression of an ALS-associated SOD1 mutant protein induces changes in HSP70 and HSC70 client association and aggregation toward polypeptides with predicted disorder, indicating that there are global effects from a single misfolded protein that extend to many clients within chaperone networks. Together these findings show that the ubiquitin-mediated UBAIT fusion system can efficiently isolate the complex interactome of HSP chaperone family proteins under normal and stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction in reducing the incidence of childhood pneumonia has not been well documented in sub-Saharan Africa. Many studies evaluating vaccine impact have used invasive pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal pneumonia as an outcome.\n\nObjectiveTo estimate the impact of routine administration of 10-valent and 13-valent PCV on the incidence of pneumonia in children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nData sourcesA systematic review was conducted between 16 and 31 July 2019. The review was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42019142369. The literature search was conducted in indexed databases including Medline and Embase, grey literature databases and online libraries of two universities. Manual search of the references of included studies was performed to identify additional relevant studies. The search strategy combined pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, pneumonia and child as search concepts.\n\nStudy selectionStudies investigating the impact of 10- or13-valent PCV on childhood pneumonia in a sub-Saharan African country were eligible for inclusion. Case-control, cohort, pre-post and time-series study designs were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were use of 7- or 9-valent PCV, systematic review studies, clinical trials and record publication prior to 2009.\n\nData extractionIndependent data extraction was conducted. Key variables include year study conducted, type of study design, type of PCV used and year of introduction, reported PCV coverage, outcome measure evaluated and the effect measure.\n\nData synthesisEight records were included in the final analysis, 6 records were pre-post or time-series studies, 1 was a case-control study and 1 report combined pre-post and case-control studies. Vaccine impact measured as percentage reduction in risk (%RR) of clinical pneumonia was mostly small and non-significant. The risk reduction was more significant and consistent on radiological and pneumococcal pneumonia. Vaccine effectiveness reported in case-control studies was mostly non-significant.\n\nConclusionEvidence of the positive impact of routine infant pneumococcal vaccination on pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa is weak. There is a need for more research in this area to evaluate the influence of pathogen or serotype replacement in pneumonia after PCV introduction. Ongoing surveillance is also required to establish the long term trend in pneumonia epidemiology after PCV introduction.",

Emerging evidence indicates the severity of post-SCI inflammation and an ongoing controversy in the roles of astrocytes with studies identifying astrocytes as associated both with ongoing inflammation and damage as well as potentially having a protective role. We have completed an extensive systematic study with MRI, histopathology, proteomics and ELISA analyses designed to further define the severe protracted and damaging inflammation after SCI in a rat model. We have identified 3 distinct phases of SCI: acute (first 2 days), inflammatory (starting day 3) and resolution (>3 months) in 16 weeks follow up. Actively phagocytizing, CD68+/CD163- macrophages infiltrate myelin-rich necrotic areas converting them into cavities of injury (COI) when deep in the spinal cord. Alternatively, superficial SCI areas are infiltrated by granulomatous tissue, or arachnoiditis where glial cells are obliterated. In the COI, CD68+/CD163- macrophage numbers reach a maximum in the first 4 weeks and then decline. Myelin phagocytosis is present at 16 weeks indicating ongoing inflammatory damage. The COI and arachnoiditis are defined by a wall of progressively hypertrophied astrocytes. MR imaging indicates persistent spinal cord edema that is linked to the severity of inflammation. Microhemorrhages in the spinal cord around the lesion are eliminated, presumably by reactive astrocytes within the first week post-injury. Acutely increased levels of TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IFN-{gamma} and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases decrease and anti-inflammatory cytokines increase in later phases. In this study we elucidated a number of fundamental mechanisms in pathogenesis of SCI and have demonstrated a close association between progressive astrogliosis and reduction in the severity of inflammation.",

Nitric oxide (NO), a versatile signaling molecule, plays a significant role in heavy metal stress tolerance. In the present investigation, the efficacy of NO application in the alleviation of copper (Cu) induced adverse impact on seed germination and photosynthesis of mustard plant (Brassica juncea L.) was evaluated. Pretreatment with NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), significantly improved seed germination and alleviated Cu-accrued oxidative stress in B. juncea seeds. However, in the absence of NO, Cu showed a higher reduction in seed germination rate. Further, NO modulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and sustained the lower level of lipid peroxidation by reducing H2O2, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), thereby elevated the antioxidative capacity in Cu-exposed seeds. Seeds pretreated with NO also retained higher amylase activities for the proper seed germination when compared with control. NO mitigated Cu toxicity through an improved antioxidant system, and reducing Cu-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduction in lipid peroxidation improving photosynthetic efficiency and growth of the mustard plant. It may concluded that NO improved amylase activity, modulated activity of antioxidant enzymes, and enhanced the germination rate seeds under Cu stress, thereby improved photosynthesis and growth.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of specific substrates by protein kinases is a key control mechanism for vital cell-fate decisions and other cellular processes. However, discovering specific kinase-substrate relationships is timeconsuming and often rather serendipitous. Computational predictions alleviate these challenges, but the current approaches suffer from limitations like restricted kinome coverage and inaccuracy. They also typically utilise only local features without reflecting broader interaction context. To address these limitations, we have developed an alternative predictive model. It uses statistical relational learning on top of phosphorylation networks interpreted as knowledge graphs, a simple yet robust model for representing networked knowledge. Compared to a representative selection of six existing systems, our model has the highest kinome coverage and produces biologically valid high-confidence predictions not possible with the other tools. Specifically, we have experimentally validated predictions of previously unknown phosphorylations by the LATS1, AKT1, PKA and MST2 kinases in human. Thus, our tool is useful for focusing phosphoproteomic experiments, and facilitates the discovery of new phosphorylation reactions. Our model can be accessed publicly via an easy-to-use web interface (LinkPhinder).\n\nAuthor SummaryLinkPhinder is a new approach to prediction of protein signalling networks based on kinase-substrate relationships that outperforms existing approaches. Phosphorylation networks govern virtually all fundamental biochemical processes in cells, and thus have moved into the centre of interest in biology, medicine and drug development. Fundamentally different from current approaches, LinkPhinder is inherently network-based and makes use of the most recent AI de-velopments. We represent existing phosphorylation data as knowledge graphs, a format for large-scale and robust knowledge representation. Training a link prediction model on such a structure leads to novel, biologically valid phosphorylation network predictions that cannot be made with competing tools. Thus our new conceptual approach can lead to establishing a new niche of AI applications in computational biology.",

    "abstract": "Hibernation is an adaptive strategy to survive harsh winter conditions and food shortage. The use of well-insulated winter dens helps animals minimize energy loss during hibernation. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) commonly use excavated dens for hibernation. Physical properties of excavated dens, such as the amount of space between a bear and the inner wall, wall/roof thickness, and bedding materials, are expected to impact heat retention and energy conservation of bears. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of physical properties of excavated dens on energy conservation in hibernating bears. Our hypothesis was that bears excavate dens in a way to minimize heat loss and optimize energy conservation during hibernation. We predicted that physical properties of excavated dens would significantly affect the bears post-hibernation body condition. To test our hypothesis and prediction, we analyzed data collected from brown bears in Sweden with linear mixed effects models, examining (i) what factors affect den-excavation behavior and (ii) if physical properties of excavated dens affect post-hibernation body condition. We found that bears excavated a den cavity in relation to their body size, that older bears tended to excavate better-fitting den cavities compared to young bears, and that the physical properties of excavated dens did not significantly affect a bears post-hibernation body condition. Older bears excavated better-fitting den cavities, suggesting a potentially experience-based shift with age in den-excavation behavior and an optimum cavity size relative to a bears body size. The strong year effect shown by the most parsimonious model for post-hibernation body condition suggests that variations in physical properties of excavated dens are possibly negligible, compared to the large annual variations in biotic and abiotic factors affecting pre-hibernation body condition and heat loss during hibernation.",

    "abstract": "We address the issue of stability of coexistence of two strategies with respect to time delays in evolving populations. It is well known that time delays may cause oscillations. Here we report a novel behavior. We show that a microscopic model of evolutionary games with a unique mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (a globally asymptotically stable interior stationary state in the standard replicator dynamics) and with strategy-dependent time delays leads to a new type of replicator dynamics. It describes the time evolution of fractions of the population playing given strategies and the size of the population. Unlike in all previous models, an interior stationary state of such dynamics depends continuously on time delays and at some point it might disappear, no cycles are present. In particular, this means that an arbitrarily small time delay changes an interior stationary state. Moreover, at certain time delays, there may appear another interior stationary state.\n\nAuthor summarySocial and biological processes are usually described by ordinary or partial differential equations, or by Markov processes if we take into account stochastic perturbations. However, interactions between individuals, players or molecules, naturally take time. Results of biological interactions between individuals may appear in the future, and in social models, individuals or players may act, that is choose appropriate strategies, on the basis of the information concerning events in the past. It is natural therefore to introduce time delays into evolutionary game models. It was usually observed, and expected, that small time delays do not change the behavior of the system and large time delays may cause oscillations. Here we report a novel behavior. We show that microscopic models of evolutionary games with strategy-dependent time delays, in which payoffs appear some time after interactions of individuals, lead to a new type of replicator dynamics. Unlike in all previous models, interior stationary states of such dynamics depend continuously on time delays. This shows that effects of time delays are much more complex than it was previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and most frequently diagnosed malignant human glioma. Despite the best available standard of care (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), the median survival of GBM patients is less than 2 years. Many recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important for promoting or reducing/limiting GBM growth. In particular, we previously showed that GBMs express decreased levels of miR-100 relative to control tissue and that restoring miR-100 expression reduced GBM tumorigenicity by modulating SMRT/NCOR2 (Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 2). Here, we demonstrate that miR-100 overexpression decreases expression of the stem cell markers, nestin and L1CAM, and decreases proliferation of GBM tumor-initiating cells (GBM stem-like cells). We further show that miR-100-mediated anti-tumorigenic activity limits the activity of SMARCA5 and its downstream target STAT3 (known as mTOR-STAT3-Notch pathway). In addition, we report ErbB3 (Her3) as a putative miR-100 target, including inhibition of its downstream AKT and ERK signaling pathways.",
