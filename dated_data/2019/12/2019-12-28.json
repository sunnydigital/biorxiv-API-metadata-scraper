    "abstract": "The generation of functional genomics datasets is surging, as they provide insight into gene regulation and organismal phenotypes (e.g., genes upregulated in cancer). The intention of functional genomics experiments is not necessarily to study genetic variants, yet they pose privacy concerns due to their use of next-generation sequencing. Moreover, there is a great incentive to share raw reads for better analyses and general research reproducibility. Thus, we need new modes of sharing beyond traditional controlled-access models. Here, we develop a data-sanitization procedure allowing raw functional genomics reads to be shared while minimizing privacy leakage, thus enabling principled privacy-utility trade-offs. It works with traditional Illumina-based assays and newer technologies such as 10x single-cell RNA-sequencing. The procedure depends on quantifying the privacy leakage in reads by statistically linking study participants to known individuals. We carried out these linkages using data from highly accurate reference genomes and more realistic environmental samples.",

Particularly, for large-size datasets (>40,000 cells), SHARPs running speed far excels other competitors while maintaining high clustering accuracy and robustness.

    "abstract": "Sleep-active neurons depolarize during sleep to suppress wakefulness circuits. Wake-active wake-promoting neurons in turn shut down sleep-active neurons, thus forming a bipartite flip-flop switch. However, how sleep is switched on is unclear because it is not known how wakefulness is translated into sleep-active neuron depolarization when the system is set to sleep. Using optogenetics in C. elegans, we solved the presynaptic circuit for depolarization of the sleep-active RIS neuron during developmentally-regulated sleep, also known as lethargus. Surprisingly, we found that RIS activation requires neurons that have known roles in wakefulness and locomotion behavior. The RIM interneurons, which are active during and can induce reverse locomotion, play a complex role and can act as inhibitors of RIS when they are strongly depolarized and as activators of RIS when they are modestly depolarized. The PVC command interneurons, which are known to promote forward locomotion during wakefulness, act as major activators of RIS. The properties of these locomotion neurons are modulated during lethargus. The RIMs become less excitable. The PVCs become resistant to inhibition and have an increased capacity to activate RIS. Separate activation of neither the PVCs nor the RIMs appears to be sufficient for sleep induction; instead, our data suggests that they act in concert to activate RIS. Forward and reverse circuit activity is normally mutually exclusive. Our data suggest that RIS may be activated at the transition between forward and reverse locomotion states, perhaps when both reverse (including RIM) and forward (PVC) circuit activity overlaps. While RIS is not strongly activated outside of lethargus, altered activity of the locomotion interneurons during lethargus favors strong RIS activation and thus sleep. The control of sleep-active neurons by locomotion circuits suggests that sleep may have evolved from locomotion quiescence. The flip-flop sleep switch in C. elegans thus requires an additional component, wake-active sleep-promoting neurons that translate wakefulness into the depolarization of a sleep-active neuron when the worm is sleepy. Wake-active sleep-promoting circuits may also be required for sleep state switching in other animals including in mammals.",

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is endemic and autochthonous in the American continent. Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus is the primary urban vector of SLEV; however, Culex interfor and Culex saltanensis have also been found naturally infected with the virus, suggesting their potential role as vectors.\n\nOBJECTIVEThe aim of this study was to determine the vector competence of Cx. interfor and Cx. saltanensis for SLEV from central Argentina in comparison to Cx. p. quinquefasciatus.\n\nMETHODSAdult female mosquitoes of the three Culex species were orally infected by feeding on viremic chicks that had been inoculated with SLEV. Then, abdomens, legs and saliva blood-fed mosquitoes were analyzed by viral plaque assay and the presence of cytopathic effect on the cell culture monolayer.\n\nRESULTSMosquitoes were permissive to orally acquired infections, to virus dissemination, and transmission of SLEV in the saliva. Cx. saltanensis and Cx. interfor are potential vectors of SLEV.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results demonstrate that in Argentina both Cx. saltanensis and Cx. interfor are susceptible to SLEV and competent for its transmission.

The aim of this study was to elucidate tissue-specific contributions and molecular mechanisms underlying cancer-induced metabolic perturbations.\n\nMethodsGlucose uptake in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as hepatic glucose production, were determined in control and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice using isotopic tracers. Skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion was analyzed via a real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound technique. Finally, the role of fatty acid turnover on glycemic control was determined by treating tumor-bearing insulin-resistant mice with nicotinic acid or etomoxir.\n\nResultsLLC tumor-bearing mice displayed reduced insulin-induced blood-glucose-lowering and glucose intolerance, which was restored by etomoxir or nicotinic acid. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was 30-40% reduced in skeletal muscle and WAT of mice carrying large tumors. Despite compromised glucose uptake, tumor-bearing mice displayed upregulated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D4Thr642 (+18%), AKTSer474 (+65%), and AKTThr309 (+86%) in muscle. Insulin caused a 70% increase in muscle microvascular perfusion in control mice, which was abolished in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, tumor-bearing mice displayed increased (+45%) basal (not insulin-stimulated) hepatic glucose production.\n\nConclusionsCancer can result in marked perturbations on at least six metabolically essential functions; i) insulins blood-glucose-lowering effect, ii) glucose tolerance, iii) skeletal muscle and WAT insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, iv) intramyocellular insulin signaling, v) muscle microvascular perfusion, and vi) basal hepatic glucose production in mice.

These results suggest that there is a single variable underlying ameboid cell motility that jointly controls speed and turning.

    "abstract": "The establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogens ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the hosts immune system. Here, we found that ISG15 restricts Dengue and Zika viruses replication through the stabilization of its binding partner USP18. ISG15 expression was necessary to control DV replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Moreover, USP18 competes with NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation, a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection. Strikingly, reconstitution of USP18 in ISG15-deficient cells was sufficient to restore the cells immune response and restrict virus growth, suggesting that the IFNAR-mediated ISG15 activity is also antiviral. Our results reveal a novel layer of complexity in the virus/host interaction interface and suggest that NS5 has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade STAT2, thereby suppressing hosts IFN-I mediated response and promoting virus replication.\n\nIMPORTANCEDisease is an emergent property that results from a microorganisms ability to replicate in a given host and the latters immune response. Here we describe how the immunoregulatory function of ISG15 (an interferon stimulated gene) affects Dengue and Zika virus replication by occupying a niche used by the virus non-structural protein 5 (NS5) to evade hosts immunity. In the absence of ISG15, NS5 efficiently degrades a main signaling hub of innate immunity, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), leading to cell immune suppression and consequently virus growth. This sheds light into how flaviviruses intimately interact with the host immune system and could lead to a host-based therapy target.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy degrades cytoplasmic cargo by its delivery to lysosomes within double membrane autophagosomes. Synthesis of the phosphoinositide PI(3)P by the autophagic PI 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1) and conjugation of ATG8/LC3 proteins to phagophore membranes by the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 (E3) complex are two critical steps in autophagosome biogenesis, connected by WIPI2. Here we present a complete reconstitution of these events. On giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), LC3 lipidation is strictly dependent on the recruitment of WIPI2, which in turn depends on PI(3)P. Ectopically targeting E3 to membranes in the absence of WIPI2 is insufficient to support LC3 lipidation, demonstrating that WIPI2 allosterically activates the E3 complex. PI3KC3-C1 and WIPI2 mutually promote the recruitment of each other in a positive feedback loop. When both PI 3-kinase and LC3 lipidation reactions were carried out simultaneously, positive feedback between PI3KC3-C1 and WIPI2 led to rapid LC3 lipidation with kinetics similar to those seen in cellular autophagosome formation.\n\nSummaryAutophagy requires the synthesis of PI(3)P and the conjugation of LC3 to the phagophore membrane.

    "abstract": "The ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate within mammalian host cells involves the generation of a membranous compartment known as the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). Salmonella employs a number of effector proteins that are injected into host cells for SCV formation using its type-three secretion systems encoded in SPI-1 and SPI-2 (T3SSSPI-1 and T3SSSPI-2, respectively). Recently, we reported that S. Typhimurium requires T3SSSPI-1 and T3SSSPI-2 to survive in the model amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Despite these findings, the involved effector proteins have not been identified yet. Therefore, we evaluated the role of two major S. Typhimurium effectors SopB and SifA during D. discoideum intracellular niche formation. First, we established that S. Typhimurium resides in a vacuolar compartment within D. discoideum. Next, we isolated SCVs from amoebae infected with wild type or the {Delta}sopB and {Delta}sifA mutant strains of S. Typhimurium, and we characterized the composition of this compartment by quantitative proteomics. This comparative analysis suggests that S. Typhimurium requires SopB and SifA to modify the SCV proteome in order to generate a suitable intracellular niche in D. discoideum. Accordingly, we observed that SopB and SifA are needed for intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium in this organism. Thus, our results provide insight into the mechanisms employed by Salmonella to survive intracellularly in phagocytic amoebae.\n\nImportanceThe molecular mechanisms involved in Salmonella survival to predation by phagocytic amoebae, such as D. discoideum, remains poorly understood. Although we established that S. Typhimurium requires two specialized type-three secretion systems to survive in D. discoideum, no effector protein has been implicated in this process so far. Here, we confirmed the presence of a membrane-bound compartment containing S. Typhimurium in D. discoideum, and purified the D. discoideum SCV to characterize the associated proteome. In doing so, we established a key role for effector proteins SopB and SifA in remodeling the protein content of the SCV that ultimately allow the intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium in D. discoideum. We also discuss similarities and differences with the proteomes of the human SCV. These findings contribute to unravel the mechanisms used by Salmonella to survive in the environment exploiting phagocytic amoebae as a reservoir.",

However, the status and function of m6A methylation in prenatal myogenesis remains unclear now.\n\nResultsIn our present study, we first demonstrate that chemical suppression of m6A and knockdown METTL14 significantly inhibit the differentiation and promote the proliferation of C2C12 myoblast cells. The mRNA expression of m6A reader protein IGF2BP1, which functions to promote the stability of target mRNA, continually decreases during the prenatal skeletal muscle development. Thereafter, profiling transcriptome-wide m6A for six developmental stage of prenatal skeletal muscle, which spanning two important waves of pig myogenesis, were performed using a refined MeRIP sequencing technology that is optimal for small-amount of RNA samples. Highly dynamic m6A methylomes across different development stages were then revealed, with majority of the affected genes enriched in pathways of skeletal muscle development. In association with the transcriptome-wide alterations, transcriptional regulatory factors (MyoD) and differentiated markers (MyHC, MYH1) of muscle development are simultaneously regulated with m6A and IGF2BP1. Knockdown of IGF2BP1 also suppresses myotube formation and promotes cell proliferation.\n\nConclusionsThe present study clarifies the dynamics of RNA m6A methylation in the regulation of prenatal skeletal muscle development, providing a data baseline for future developmental as well as biomedical studies of m6A functions in muscle development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Controlling an evolving population is an important task in modern molecular genetics, including directed evolution for improving the activity of molecules and enzymes, in breeding experiments in animals and in plants, and in devising public health strategies to suppress evolving pathogens. An optimal intervention to direct evolution should be designed by considering its impact over an entire stochastic evolutionary trajectory that follows. As a result, a seemingly suboptimal intervention at a given time can be globally optimal as it can open opportunities for desirable actions in the future. Here, we propose a feedback control formalism to devise globally optimal artificial selection protocol to direct the evolution of molecular phenotypes. We show that artificial selection should be designed to counter evolutionary tradeoffs among multi-variate phenotypes to avoid undesirable outcomes in one phenotype by imposing selection on another. Control by artificial selection is challenged by our ability to predict molecular evolution. We develop an information theoretical framework and show that molecular time-scales for evolution under natural selection can inform how to monitor a population in order to acquire sufficient predictive information for an effective intervention with artificial selection. Our formalism opens a new avenue for devising artificial selection methods for directed evolution of molecular functions.",

    "abstract": "The Kingman coalescent and its developments are often considered among the most important advances in population genetics of the last decades. Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (\"super-spreaders\").\n\nHere we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages, are more appropriate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local MTB populations and outbreaks, and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB outbreaks should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.",

    "abstract": "Although epigenetic factors may influence the expression of defense genes in plants, their role in antiviral responses and the impact of viral adaptation and evolution in shaping these interactions are still poorly explored. We used two isolates of turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV) with varying degrees of adaptation to Arabidopsis thaliana to address these issues. One of the isolates was experimentally evolved in the plant and presented increased load and virulence relative to the ancestral isolate. The magnitude of the transcriptomic responses were larger for the evolved isolate and indicated a role of innate immunity systems triggered by molecular patterns and effectors in the infection process. Several transposable elements (TEs) located in different chromatin contexts and epigenetic-related genes were also affected. Correspondingly, mutant plants having loss or gain of repressive marks were, respectively, more tolerant and susceptible to TuMV, with a more efficient response against the ancestral isolate. In wild-type plants both isolates induced similar levels of cytosine methylation changes, including in and around TEs and stress-related genes. Results collectively suggested that apart from RNA silencing and basal immunity systems, DNA methylation and histone modification pathways may also be required for mounting proper antiviral defenses in plants and that the effectiveness of this type of regulation strongly depends on the degree of viral adaptation to the host.",

    "abstract": "Type VI CRISPR enzymes have recently been identified as programmable RNA-guided, RNA-targeting Cas proteins with nuclease activity that allow for specific and robust target gene knock-down without altering the genome. However, we currently lack information about optimal Cas13 guide RNA designs for high target RNA knock-down efficacy. To close this gap, we conducted four massively-parallel Cas13 screens targeting the mRNA of a destabilized green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene and CD46, CD55 and CD71 cell surface proteins in human cells. In total, we measured the activity of 24,460 guide RNA including 6,469 perfect match guide RNAs and a diverse set of guide RNA variants and permutations with mismatches relative to the target sequences.\n\nWe find that guide RNAs show high diversity in knock-down efficiency driven by crRNA-specific features as well as target site context. Moreover, while single mismatches generally reduce knock-down to a modest degree, we identify a critical region spanning spacer nucleotides 15 - 21 that is largely intolerant to target site mismatches. We developed a computational model to identify guide RNAs with high knock-down efficacy. We confirmed the models generalizability across a large number of endogenous target mRNAs and show that Cas13 can be used in forward genetic pooled CRISPR-screens to identify essential genes. Using this model, we provide a resource of optimized Cas13 guide RNAs to target all protein-coding transcripts in the human genome, enabling transcriptome-wide forward genetic screens.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) enables transgene characterization of gene-therapy vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), but current library generation uses complicated and potentially biased second-strand synthesis. We report that libraries for nanopore sequencing of ssDNA can be conveniently created without second-strand synthesis using a transposase-based protocol. We show for bacteriophage M13 ssDNA that the MuA transposase has unexpected residual activity on ssDNA, explained in part by transposase action on transient double-stranded hairpins. In case of AAV, library creation is additionally aided by genome hybridization. We demonstrate the power of direct sequencing combined with nanopore long reads by characterizing AAV vector transgenes. Sequencing yielded reads up to full genome length, including GC-rich inverted terminal repeats. Unlike short-read techniques, single reads covered genome-genome and genome-contaminant fusions and other recombination events, while additionally providing information on epigenetic methylation. Single-nucleotide variants across the transgene cassette were revealed and secondary genome packaging signals were readily identified. Moreover, comparison of sequence abundance with qPCR results demonstrated the techniques future potential for quantification of DNA impurities in AAV vector stocks. The findings promote direct nanopore sequencing as a fast and versatile platform for ssDNA characterization, such as AAV ssDNA in research and clinical settings.",

However, the lack of genome information on this insect severely limits our understanding of its rapid adaptation and hampers the development of efficient pest management strategies.\n\nFindingsWe report a chromosome-level genome assembly using single-molecule real-time PacBio sequencing and Hi-C data. The final genome assembly was 446.80 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 14.36 Mb, and captured 97.9% complete arthropod Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO, n=1,658). A total of 367 contigs were anchored to 32 pseudo-chromosomes, covering 96.18% (429.74 Mb) of the total genome length. We predicted 17,727 protein-coding genes, of which 81.60% were supported by transcriptome evidence and 96.47% matched UniProt protein records. We also identified 867,102 (147.97 Mb/33.12%) repetitive elements and 1,609 noncoding RNAs. Synteny inference indicated a conserved collinearity between three lepidopteran species. Gene family evolution and function enrichment analyses showed the significant expansions in families related to development, dietary, detoxification and chemosensory system, indicating these families may play a role in host plant specialization and niche adaptation.\n\nConclusionsWe have generated a high-quality chromosomal-level genome that could provide a valuable resource for a better understanding and management of the beet armyworm.",

    "abstract": "One of the first signs of viral infection is body-wide aches and pain. While this type of pain usually subsides, at the extreme, viral infections can induce painful neuropathies that can last for decades. Neither of these types of pain sensitization are well understood. A key part of the response to viral infection is production of interferons (IFNs), which then activate their specific receptors (IFNRs) resulting in downstream activation of cellular signaling and a variety of physiological responses. We sought to understand how type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-{beta}) might act directly on nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to cause pain sensitization. We demonstrate that type I IFNRs are expressed in small/medium DRG neurons and that their activation produces neuronal hyper-excitability and mechanical pain in mice. Type I IFNs stimulate JAK/STAT signaling in DRG neurons but this does not apparently result in PKR-eIF2 activation that normally induces an anti-viral response by limiting mRNA translation. Rather, type I interferons stimulate MNK-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation in DRG neurons to promote pain hypersensitivity. Endogenous release of type I IFNs with the double stranded RNA mimetic poly(I:C) likewise produces pain hypersensitivity that is blunted in mice lacking MNK-eIF4E signaling. Our findings reveal mechanisms through which type I IFNs cause nociceptor sensitization with implications for understanding how viral infections promote pain and can lead to neuropathies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt is increasingly understood that pathogens interact with nociceptors to alert organisms to infection as well as to mount early host defenses. While specific mechanisms have been discovered for diverse bacteria and fungal pathogens, mechanisms engaged by viruses have remained elusive. Here we show that type 1 interferons, one of the first mediators produced by viral infection, act directly on nociceptors to produce pain sensitization. Type I interferons act via a specific signaling pathway (MNK-eIF4E signaling) that is known to produce nociceptor sensitization in inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Our work reveals a mechanism through which viral infections cause heightened pain sensitivity",

Current in vitro transcription  roadblocking approaches inhibit transcription elongation using a protein blockade bound to the DNA template. One limitation of protein-mediated transcription roadblocking is that it requires the inclusion of a protein factor that is extrinsic to the minimal in vitro transcription reaction. In this work, we show that interrupting the transcribed DNA strand with an internal desthiobiotin-triethylene glycol modification efficiently and stably halts Escherichia coli RNA polymerase transcription. To facilitate diverse applications of chemical transcription roadblocking, we establish a simple and sequence-independent method for the preparation of internally modified double-stranded DNA templates by sequential PCR and translesion synthesis. By encoding an intrinsic stall site within the template DNA, our chemical transcription roadblocking approach enables nascent RNA molecules to be displayed from RNA polymerase in a minimal in vitro transcription reaction.",

Using a microfluidic device to deliver controlled stimuli to intact animals and large, immobile, and fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondria as fiducial markers in the touch receptor neurons (TRNs), we visualized and measured touch-induced mechanical strain in C. elegans worms. At steady-state, touch stimuli sufficient to activate TRNs induce an average strain of 3.1% at the center of the actuator and this strain decays to near zero at the edges of the actuator. We also measured strain in animals carrying mutations affecting links between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the TRNs but could not detect any differences in touch-induced mechanical strain between wild-type and mutant animals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that touching the skin induces local mechanical strain in intact animals and suggest that a fully intact ECM is not essential for transmitting mechanical strain from the skin to cutaneous mechanosensory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Waves of spontaneous activity sweep across the neonatal mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer, driven by directly interconnected cholinergic starburst amacrine cells from postnatal day (P) 0-10, followed by waves driven by glutamatergic bipolar cells. We found transient clusters of auto-fluorescent cells in the RGC layer during the period of cholinergic waves. They appear around the optic nerve head at P2 and become gradually displaced towards the periphery between P2-8 and then they disappear. Pan-retinal multielectrode array recordings reveal that cholinergic wave origins follow a similar, non-random developmental center-to-periphery pattern. Electrical imaging unmasks hotspots of dipole electrical activity occurring in the vicinity of wave origins. We propose that these activity hotspots are the sites for wave initiation and may originate from the transient cell clusters, reminiscent of activity in transient subplate neurons in the developing cortex, suggesting a universal hyper-excitability mechanism in developing CNS networks during the critical period for brain wiring.",

Each subunit of these tetrameric channels is composed of six transmembrane helices, of which the anti-parallel helix bundle S1-S4 constitutes the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) and S5-S6 forms the pore domain. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we report novel responses of the archaebacterial potassium channel KvAP to cell polarization. We show that the S4 helix, which is straight in the experimental crystal structure solved under depolarized conditions (Vm [~] 0), breaks into two segments when the cell is polarized (Vm << 0), and reversibly forms a single straight helix following depolarization of the cell (Vm =0). The outermost segment of S4 translates along the normal to the membrane, bringing new perspective to previously paradoxical accessibility experiments that were initially thought to imply the displacement of the whole VSD across the membrane. Our simulations of KvAP reveal that the breaking of S4 under polarization is not a feature unique to hyperpolarization activated channel, as might be suggested by recent cryo-EM structures and MD simulations of the HCN channel.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval of synaptic vesicles via endocytosis is essential for maintaining sustained synaptic transmission, especially for neurons that fire action potentials at high frequencies. However, how activity regulates synaptic vesicles recycling is largely unknown. Here we report that Na+ substantially accumulated in the mouse calyx of Held terminals during repetitive high-frequency spiking. Elevated presynaptic Na+ accelerated both slow and rapid forms of endocytosis and facilitated endocytosis overshoot but did not affect the readily releasable pool size, Ca2+ influx, or exocytosis. To examine whether this facilitation of endocytosis is related to the Na+-dependent vesicular content change, we dialyzed increasing concentrations of glutamate into the presynaptic cytosol or blocked the vesicular glutamate uptake with bafilomycin and found the rate of endocytosis was not affected by regulating the glutamate content in the presynaptic terminal. Endocytosis is critically dependent on intracellular Ca2+, and the activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) may be altered when the Na+ gradient is changed. However, neither NCX blocker nor change of extracellular Na+ concentration affected the endocytosis rate. Moreover, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that presynaptic Na+ did not affect the action potential-evoked intracellular Ca2+ transient and decay. Therefore, we revealed a novel mechanism of cytosolic Na+ in accelerating vesicle endocytosis. During high-frequency synaptic transmission, when large amounts of synaptic vesicles are fused, Na+ accumulated in terminals, facilitated vesicle recycling and sustained reliable synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins contain multiple folded domains separated by flexible linkers, and the ability to describe the structure and conformational heterogeneity of such flexible systems pushes the limits of structural biology. Using the three-domain protein TIA-1 as an example, we here combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with previously measured small-angle scattering data to study the conformation of TIA-1 in solution. We show that while the coarse-grained potential (Martini) in itself leads to too compact conformations, increasing the strength of protein-water interactions results in ensembles that are in very good agreement with experiments. We show how these ensembles can be refined further using a Bayesian/Maximum Entropy approach, and examine the robustness to errors in the energy function. In particular we find that as long as the initial simulation is relatively good, reweighting against experiments is very robust. We also study the relative information in X-ray and neutron scattering experiments and find that refining against the SAXS experiments leads to improvement in the SANS data. Our results suggest a general strategy for studying the conformation of multi-domain proteins in solution that combines coarse-grained simulations with small-angle X-ray scattering data that are generally most easy to obtain. These results may in turn be used to design further small-angle neutron scattering experiments that exploit contrast variation through 1H/2H isotope substitutions.",

During the catalytic cycle of EcTPx, the peroxidatic cysteine (CP) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by peroxide, then the resolving cysteine (CR) condenses with the sulfenic acid of CP to form a disulfide bond, which is finally reduced by thioredoxin. Purified EcTPx as dithiol and disulfide behaves as a monomer in close to physiological conditions. Although secondary structure rearrangements are present when comparing different redox states of the enzyme, no significant differences in unfolding free energies are observed under reducing and oxidizing conditions. A conformational change denominated fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) transition, involving a partial unfolding of H2 and H3 helices, must occur to enable the formation of the disulfide bond since the catalytic cysteines are 12 [A] apart in the FF conformation of EcTPx. To explore this crucial process, the mechanism of the FF[-&gt;]LU and the LU[-&gt;]FF transitions were studied using long time scale conventional molecular dynamic simulations and an enhanced conformational sampling technique for different oxidation and protonation states of CP and/or CR. Our results suggest that the FF[-&gt;]LU transition has a higher associated energy barrier than the refolding LU[-&gt;]FF process in agreement with the relatively slow experimental turnover number of EcTPx. Furthermore, in silico designed single-point mutants of the H3 enhanced locally unfolding events, suggesting that the native FF interactions in the active site are not evolutionary optimized to fully speed-up the conformational transition of wild-type EcTPx.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between trial-to-trial variability in neural responses of sensory areas and behavioral choices is fundamental to elucidate the mechanisms of perceptual decision-making. In two-choice tasks, activity-choice co-variations have traditionally been quantified with choice probabilities (CP). It has been so far commonly assumed that choice-related neural signals are separable from stimulus-driven responses, which has led to characterizing activity-choice covariations only with a single CP value estimated combining trials from all stimulus levels. In this work we provide theoretical and experimental evidence for the stimulus dependence of the relationship between neural responses and behavioral choices. We derived a general analytical CP expression for this dependency under the general assumption that a decision threshold converts an internal stimulus estimate into a binary choice. This expression predicts a stereotyped threshold-induced CP modulation by the stimulus information content. We reanalyzed data from Britten et al. (1996) and found evidence of this modulation in the responses of macaque MT cells during a random dot discrimination task. Moreover, we developed new methods of analysis that allowed us to further identify a richer structure of cell-specific CP stimulus dependencies. Finally, we capitalised on this progress to develop new generalized linear models (GLMs) with stimulus-choice interaction terms, which show a higher predictive power and lead to a more precise assessment of how much each neuron is stimulus- or choice-driven, hence allowing a more accurate comparison across areas or cell types. Our work suggests that characterizing the patterns of stimulus dependence of choice-related signals is essential to properly determine how neurons in different areas contribute to linking sensory representations to perceptual decisions.",

Direct pathway stimulation initiates licking, whereas indirect pathway stimulation suppresses licking and results in rebound licking after stimulation. Moreover, direct and indirect pathways also play distinct roles in timing.

    "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis is a complex physiological process, which plays a central role in maintaining cognitive functions, and consists of progenitor cell proliferation, newborn cell migration, and cell maturation. Adult neurogenesis is susceptible to alterations under various physiological and pathological conditions. A substantial decay of neurogenesis has been documented in Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and animal AD models; however, several treatment strategies can halt any further decline and even induce neurogenesis.\n\nOur previous results indicated a potential effect of arginase inhibition, with norvaline, on various aspects of neurogenesis in triple-transgenic mice. To better evaluate this effect, we chronically administer an arginase inhibitor, norvaline, to triple-transgenic and wild-type mice, and apply an advanced immunohistochemistry approach with several biomarkers and bright-field microscopy.\n\nRemarkably, we evidence a significant reduction in the density of neuronal progenitors, which demonstrate a different phenotype in the hippocampi of triple-transgenic mice as compared to wild-type animals. However, norvaline shows no significant effect upon the progenitor cell number and constitution. We demonstrate that norvaline treatment leads to an escalation of the polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule immunopositivity, which suggests an improvement in the newborn neuron survival rate. Additionally, we identify a significant increase in the hippocampal microtubule-associated protein 2 stain intensity. We also explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of norvaline on adult mice neurogenesis and provide insights into their machinery.",

Despite their importance for host colonization, however, how C. jejuni coordinates rotation of these two opposing flagella is unclear. As well as their polar placement, C. jejunis flagella deviate from the Enterobacteriaceael norm in other ways: their flagellar motors produce much higher torque and their flagellar filament is made of two different zones of two different flagellins. To understand how C. jejunis opposed motors coordinate, and what contribution these factors play in C. jejuni motility, we developed strains with flagella that could be fluorescently labeled, and observed them by high-speed video microscopy. We found that C. jejuni coordinates its dual flagella by wrapping the leading filament around the cell body during swimming in high-viscosity media and that its differentiated flagellar filament has evolved to facilitate this wrapped-mode swimming. Unexpectedly, C. jejunis helical body is important for facile unwrapping of the flagellar filament from the cell body during switching of swimming trajectory. Our findings demonstrate how multiple facets of C. jejunis flagella and cell plan have co-evolved for optimal motility in high-viscosity environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.The Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) is a metacognitive phenomenon of illusory superiority in which individuals who perform poorly on a task believe they performed better than others, yet individuals who performed very well believe they under-performed compared to others. This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for reaction times or physiological correlates. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile overestimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile underestimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition x group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile.\n\nBetween-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators from 400-600 ms, whereas  old-new memory ERP effects revealed a late parietal component (LPC) associated with recollection-based processing from 600-900 ms for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators rely on recollection during memory and over-estimators draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority and inferiority.\n\nGraphical AbstractEvent-related potentials (ERPS) were recorded for the Dunning-Kruger Effect as subjects made metacognitive judgments about performance on a memory task. Over- and Under-estimators exhibited a crossover interaction in response times when believing they did best and worst, respectively. A crossover pattern was also observed for ERPs: LPC signals of recollection were found for under-estimators, whereas familiarity-based FN400 effects were evident for over-estimators and correlated with estimates.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=184 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/888511v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d42b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75ef31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aa8a9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@725925_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "This study presents a computational model of closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinsons disease (PD) to investigate clinically-viable control schemes for suppressing pathological beta-band activity. Closed-loop DBS for PD has shown promising results in preliminary clinical studies and offers the potential to achieve better control of patient symptoms and side effects with lower power consumption than conventional open-loop DBS. However, extensive testing of algorithms in patients is difficult. The model presented provides a means to explore a range of control algorithms in silico and optimize control parameters before preclinical testing. The model incorporates (i) the extracellular DBS electric field, (ii) antidromic and orthodromic activation of STN afferent fibers, (iii) the LFP detected at non-stimulating contacts on the DBS electrode and (iv) temporal variation of network beta-band activity within the thalamo-cortico-basal ganglia loop. The performance of on-off and dual-threshold controllers for suppressing beta-band activity by modulating the DBS amplitude were first verified, showing levels of beta suppression and reductions in power consumption comparable with previous clinical studies. Proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) closed-loop controllers for amplitude and frequency modulation were then investigated. A simple tuning rule was derived for selecting effective PI controller parameters to target long duration beta bursts while respecting clinical constraints that limit the rate of change of stimulation parameters. Of the controllers tested, PI controllers displayed superior performance for regulating network beta-band activity whilst accounting for clinical considerations. Proportional controllers resulted in undesirable rapid fluctuations of the DBS parameters which may exceed clinically tolerable rate limits. Overall, the PI controller for modulating DBS frequency performed best, reducing the mean error by 83% compared to DBS off and the mean power consumed to 25% of that utilized by open-loop DBS. The network model presented captures sufficient physiological detail to act as a surrogate for preclinical testing of closed-loop DBS algorithms using a clinically accessible biomarker, providing a first step for deriving and testing novel, clinically-suitable closed-loop DBS controllers.",

    "abstract": "The E. coli metabolome is an interconnected set of enzymes that has measurable kinetic parameters ascribed for the production of most of its metabolites. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) or Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models are used to increase product yield using defined media. However, they either give a range (FBA) or exact amount (ODE) of metabolite yield which isnt true as the transcriptome diversity of individual cells isnt considered. We formulate the metabolic-behaviour of individual cells by using a POpulation SYstems-Biology ALgorithm (POSYBAL) which predicts multiple-gene knockouts for increasing industrially relevant metabolites. We validate this prediction for producing isobutanol (Heterogenous metabolite) and shikimate (Homogenous metabolite) where, the product-yield was increased by 40 times (~2000 ppm) and 42 times (~3000 ppm) respectively. Also, we introduce a nitrogen-swap in standard media to its low-nitrogen counterpart during post-growth phase to redistribute flux towards non-nitrogenous pathways for increasing overall product-yield. Further, our model shows growth-phase diversity in bacterial population even under normal glucose-uptake, portraying a real-world scenario of diverse and robust environment thus, making it evolutionarily favourable to threats such as anti-bacterial attack.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of herbivorous insects is attributed to their propensity to specialize on toxic plants. In an evolutionary twist, toxins betray the identity of their bearers when herbivores co-opt them as cues for host-plant finding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. We focused on Scaptomyza flava, an herbivorous drosophilid specialized on isothiocyanate (ITC)-producing (Brassicaceae) plants, and identified Or67b paralogs that were triplicated as mustard-specific herbivory evolved. Using heterologous systems for the expression of olfactory receptors, we found that S. flava Or67bs, but not homologs from microbe-feeding relatives, responded selectively to ITCs, each paralog detecting different ITC subsets. Consistent with this, S. flava was attracted to ITCs, as was Drosophila melanogaster expressing S. flava Or67b3 in the homologous Or67b olfactory circuit. Thus, our results show that plant toxins were likely co-opted as olfactory attractants through gene duplication and functional specialization (neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization) in drosophilid flies.",

We demonstrate in 1,976 subjects of a prospective population cohort that specific gut microbiota members show diurnal oscillations in their relative abundance and we identified 13 taxa with disrupted rhythmicity in T2D. Prediction models based on this signature classified T2D with an area under the curve of 73%. BMI as microbiota-independent risk marker further improved diagnostic classification of T2D. The validity of this arrhythmic risk signature to predict T2D was confirmed in 699 KORA subjects five years after initial sampling. Shotgun metagenomic analysis linked 26 pathways associated with xenobiotic, amino acid, fatty acid, and taurine metabolism to the diurnal oscillation of gut bacteria. In summary, we determined a cohort-specific risk pattern of arrhythmic taxa which significantly contributes to the classification and prediction of T2D, highlighting the importance of circadian rhythmicity of the microbiome in targeting metabolic human diseases.",

Over the past years, many studies have extensively characterized the involvement of miRNA-mediated regulation in neurogenesis and brain development. However, a comprehensive catalog of cortical miRNAs cell-specifically expressed in progenitor types of the developing mammalian cortex is still missing. Overcoming this limitation, here we exploited a double reporter mouse line previously validated by our group to allow the identification of the transcriptional signature to neurogenic commitment and provide the field with the complete atlas of miRNAs expression in proliferating neural stem cells, neurogenic progenitors and newborn neurons during corticogenesis. By extending the currently known list of miRNAs expressed in the mouse brain by over two fold, our study highlights the power of cell type-specific analyses for the detection of transcripts that would otherwise be diluted out when studying bulk tissues. We further exploited our data by predicting putative novel miRNAs and validated the power of our approach by providing novel evidence for the involvement of miR-486 as a novel player in brain development.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disturbance afflicting a variety of functions from perception to cognition. The recent computational focus suggesting aberrant Bayesian inference in ASD has yielded promising but conflicting results in attempting to explain a wide variety of phenotypes by canonical computations. Here we used a naturalistic visual path integration task that combines continuous action with active sensing and allows tracking of subjects dynamic belief states. Both groups showed a previously documented bias pattern, by overshooting the radial distance and angular eccentricity of targets. For both control and ASD groups, these errors were driven by misestimated velocity signals due to a non-uniform speed prior, rather than imperfect integration. We tracked participants beliefs and found no difference in the speed prior, but heightened variability in the ASD group. Both end-point variance and trajectory irregularities correlated with ASD symptom severity. With feedback, variance was reduced and ASD performance approached that of controls. These findings highlight the need for both more naturalistic tasks and a broader computational perspective to understand the ASD phenotype and pathology.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The ASMR is characterized by a tingling sensation around the scalp and neck and often induces a feeling of relaxation and a reduction of a negative mood. However, it is still unknown what factors affect the ASMR. The present study focused on stimulus characteristics and individuals mood states and personality traits. Participants filled out self-reported questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Big Five Inventory) and reported ASMR estimates throughout a 17-min experiment while listening to binaural tapping and brushing sounds. Cross-correlation results showed that the ASMR estimates were strongly associated with the acoustic features of auditory stimuli, such as their amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth. This indicates that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre trigger the ASMR. The maximum ASMR was observed around 2 s after the acoustic features changed, suggesting that the sluggishness of multisensory integration may lead to the ASMR experience. In addition, individual differences in the ASMR experience were closely linked to participants mood states, such as anxiety, but not to their personality traits. Our results provide important clues to understand the mechanisms of auditory-somatosensory interactions.\n\nSignificant StatementsThe autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is characterized by a tingling, electrostatic-like sensation across the scalp and back of the neck. This phenomenon can be triggered by a variety of audiovisual stimuli, and many people seek out the ASMR via the internet to receive a feeling of relaxation and reduce a negative mood. We show that the ASMR is induced about 2 s after acoustic features, such as the amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth are changed. This suggests that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre lead to the ASMR experience. The stimulus-driven ASMR effect is found regardless of the personality traits or mood states of participants. Our findings provide a critical clue to understand the mechanisms of auditory-somatosensory interactions.",

Human iPSC-based applications are often limited by the variability among iPSC lines originating from a single donor, as well as the heterogeneity among specific cell types that can be derived from iPSCs. The ability to deeply phenotype different iPSC-derived cell types is therefore of primary importance to the successful and informative application of this technology. Here we describe a combination of motor neuron (MN) derivation and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches to generate and characterize specific MN subtypes obtained from human iPSCs. Our studies provide evidence for rapid and robust generation of MN progenitor cells that can give rise to a heterogenous population of brainstem and spinal cord MNs. Approximately 58% of human iPSC-derived MNs display molecular characteristics of lateral motor column MNs, [~]19% of induced MNs resemble hypaxial motor column MNs, while [~]6% of induced MNs have features of medial motor column MNs. The present study has the potential to improve our understanding of iPSC-derived MN subtype function and dysfunction, possibly leading to improved iPSC-based applications for the study of human MN biology and diseases.",

Following peripheral nerve injury, adult reactive Schwann cells de-differentiate and express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); suggesting that reactive Schwann cells impact axonal regeneration precision.\n\nMethodsTransgenic GFAP-thymidine kinase (TK) mouse model was employed, allowing selective downregulation of reactive GFAP expressing Schwann cells on exposure of 7 day osmotic pump delivery of ganciclovir. Adult female transgenic GFAP-TK mice had right facial nerve transected and then immediately repaired with tissue glue, they then either were treated with saline or ganciclovir (GCV). At 6 weeks post-injury, mice were exposed to random air puffs events while high speed videography recorded whisker and eye movement. MatLab code video processing with publicly available BIOTACT algorithm automatically tracked whiskers.\n\nResultsWhisker velocity was calculated using binning statistical analysis. Saline treated animals confirmed our models ability to detect aberrant movement such that intact (left) facial nerves caused whisker protraction, while repaired (right) facial nerves had retraction. Administration of GCV increased whisker retraction compared to saline. GCV did not impact intact animal whisker movement compared to repaired whiskers.\n\nConclusionsInhibition of reactive Schwann cell proliferation appears to worse the degree of synkinesis, providing important insight into a potential therapeutic target for facial nerve injury.",

An extended two-layer version of the network model that captures some properties of higher visual cortical areas is also characterized using this approach.

These symbols convey various semantic information, and numerate adults can easily extract from them several numerical features such as magnitude and parity. Nonetheless, since most studies used active processing tasks to assess these properties, it remains unclear whether and to what degree the access to magnitude and especially to parity is automatic. Here we investigated with EEG whether spontaneous processing of magnitude or parity can be recorded in a frequency-tagging approach, in which participants are passively stimulated by fast visual sequences of Arabic digits. We assessed automatic magnitude processing by presenting a stream of frequent small digit numbers mixed with deviant large digits (and the reverse) with a sinusoidal contrast modulation at the frequency of 10 Hz. We used the same paradigm to investigate numerical parity processing, contrasting odd digits to even digits. We found significant brain responses at the frequency of the fluctuating change and its harmonics, recorded on electrodes encompassing right occipitoparietal regions, in both conditions. Our findings indicate that both magnitude and parity are spontaneously and unintentionally extracted from Arabic digits, which supports that they are salient semantic features deeply associated to digit symbols in long-term memory.",

Obesity is a major risk factor for hyperglycemia, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that a high fat diet (HFD) in mice causes early loss of expression of the glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2) specifically in adipose tissue. Adipose-specific knockout of Hk2 caused enhanced gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in liver, a condition known as selective insulin resistance, leading to glucose intolerance. Furthermore, we observed reduced hexokinase activity in adipose tissue of obese and diabetic patients, and identified a loss-of-function mutation in the hk2 gene of naturally hyperglycemic Mexican cavefish. Mechanistically, HFD in mice led to loss of HK2 by inhibiting translation of Hk2 mRNA. Our findings identify adipose HK2 as a critical mediator of systemic glucose homeostasis, and suggest that obesity-induced loss of adipose HK2 is an evolutionarily conserved, non-cell-autonomous mechanism for the development of hyperglycemia.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLoss of the glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 in adipose tissue is a mechanism underlying high blood glucose levels.",

Prevailing theory suggests that many species exploit hydrodynamic refuges to minimize the cost of locomotion while foraging. Here we challenge this theory based on direct oxygen consumption measurements of drift-feeding trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) foraging in the freestream and from behind a flow refuge at velocities up to 100 cm s-1. We demonstrate that refuging is not energetically beneficial when foraging in fast flows due to a high attack cost and low prey capture success associated with leaving a station-holding refuge to intercept prey. By integrating optimum foraging theory with empirical data from respirometry and video imaging, we develop a mathematical model to predict when drift-feeding fishes should exploit or avoid refuges based on prey density, size and flow velocity. Our foraging and refuging model provides new mechanistic insights into the locomotor costs, habitat use, and prey selection of fishes foraging in current-swept habitats.",

    "abstract": "Dimension reduction is often used for several procedures of analysis of high dimensional biomedical data-sets such as classification or outlier detection. To improve performance of such data-mining steps, preserving both distance information and local topology among data-points could be more useful than giving priority to visualisation in low dimension. Therefore, we introduce topology preserving distance scaling (TPDS) to augment dimension reduction method meant to reproduce distance information in higher dimension. Our approach involves distance inflation to preserve local topology to avoid collapse during distance preservation based optimisation. Applying TPDS on diverse biomedical data-sets revealed that besides providing better visualisation than typical distance preserving methods, TPDS leads to better classification of data points in reduced dimension. For data-sets with outliers, the approach of TPDS also proves to be useful, even for purely distance-preserving method for achieving better convergence.",

    "abstract": "The computational prediction of gene function is a key step in making full use of newly sequenced genomes. Function is generally predicted by transferring annotations from homologous genes or proteins for which experimental evidence exists. The \"ortholog conjecture\" proposes that orthologous genes should be preferred when making such predictions, as they evolve functions more slowly than paralogous genes. Previous research has provided little support for the ortholog conjecture, though the incomplete nature of the data cast doubt on the conclusions. Here we use experimental annotations from over 40,000 proteins, drawn from over 80,000 publications, to revisit the ortholog conjecture in two pairs of species: (i) Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By making a distinction between questions about the evolution of function versus questions about the prediction of function, we find strong evidence against the ortholog conjecture in the context of function prediction, though questions about the evolution of function remain difficult to address. In both pairs of species, we quantify the amount of data that must be ignored if paralogs are discarded, as well as the resulting loss in prediction accuracy. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that the types of homologs used for function transfer are largely irrelevant to the task of function prediction. Aiming to maximize the amount of data used for this task, regardless of whether it comes from orthologs or paralogs, is most likely to lead to higher prediction accuracy.",

We identify subpopulations of T lymphocytes expressing genes reflecting recent activation by antigen in situ. A PD-1+TOX+EOMES+ population of CD4+ T lymphocytes expressed immune regulatory genes and chemoattractant genes for myeloid cells. A PD-1+TOX+BHLHE40+ population of CD4+, and a mirror population of CD8+ T lymphocytes expressed genes driving inflammation, and genes supporting B lymphocyte activation.

Phrynocephalus mystaceus mainly lives in dune habitats, has a developed bilateral toe fringe, and exhibits fast sand-diving behavior for predator avoidance. We tested the effects of resecting the medial and bilateral toe fringes on the locomotor performance and sand-diving performance of P. mystaceus. The results showed that the individuals that had their medial toe fringe removed exhibited significantly faster sprint speeds than the unresected and all resected individuals (P <0.05). The results of stepwise regression analysis show that the relative area of the toe fringe is an important morphological feature that affects locomotor performance. The sand-burial performance scores of the unresected individuals were significantly greater than those of the resected individuals (P <0.05). The results of stepwise regression analysis show that the relative area of toe fringe and the axilla-groin length are the main morphological features that affect the sand-diving performance of P. mystaceus. After the bilateral toe fringe was removed, a significant negative correlation between locomotor and sand-diving performance was observed (P <0.05). Taken together, these results provide experimental evidence that toe fringe is positively associated with the locomotor and sand-diving performance of P. mystaceus.",

This river has long been used for a variety of purposes including source of public water supply, small scale irrigation, bathing, washing, animal watering, sand and stone dredging and recreation.\n\nObjectiveTo assess the influence of Finoteselam town on ecological status of Lahi river\n\nMethodsThe assessment were assessed using physicochemical parameters, physical habitat assessment, biotic indices /metrics, human activity by observation as well as macroinvertabretes samples from eleven sampling sites coded S1 to S11 along the river using the standard procedures. The assessments were involved in-situ measurements and collection of water samples in April 2019 then, analyzed the water samples in laboratory.\n\nResultsThe biological analysis reveals a notable reduction of the diversity macroinvertabrates in the downstream direction where the minimum was at midstream sites. Upstream has significantly better macroinvertabrates assemblage than midstream (p-value<0.05). Physical habitat evaluation scores varied from 43 at S8 to 173 at S1 and relatively lower score were recorded at midstream sites. Low % of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera with high family biotic index and high % of Diptera with low biological monitoring working party also indicated water ecology deteriorated mainly at midstream sites. Multivariate analysis of classical analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and none metric multidimensional scaling also indicated ecological deterioration at midstream sites mainly at S5, S6, S7 and S8.\n\nConclusionMidstream was relatively more polluted than upstream due to influence of pollutant from Finoteselam town. The ecological status of upstream segments of the river is very good with slight organic pollutions, and at midstream is poor and significant degree of organic pollutions; whereas the status of the downstream is fair with fairly substantial water pollution showing moderate ecological disturbance. In general, midstream the sampling stations show the deterioration in water ecology and thus necessitated a need for mitigation measure to save the Lahi.",

Briefly, according to the \"Nash equilibrium\", Ag85B is the main virulence factor for Mtb in active phase, however it is the most immunogenic factor if the host can respond by high expression of T-bet and iNOS. In this situation, Mtb can express high levels of ESAT-6 and CFP10 and change the game to the latency, in which host responses by medium expression of T-bet and iNOS and medium level of TGF-{beta} and IDO. Consistently, The IDO expression was 134-times higher in TB+s than the TB-s, and the T-bet expression, ~200-times higher in the TB-s than the TB+s.

    "abstract": "DNA is replicated in a defined temporal order termed the replication timing (RT) program. RT is spatially segregated in the nucleus with early/late replication corresponding to Hi-C A/B chromatin compartments, respectively. Early replication is also associated with active histone modifications and transcriptional permissiveness. However, the mechanistic interplay between RT, chromatin state, and genome compartmentalization is largely unknown. Here we report that RT is central to epigenome maintenance and compartmentalization in both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cancer cell line HCT116. Knockout (KO) of the conserved RT control factor RIF1, rather than causing discrete RT switches as previously suspected, lead to dramatically increased cell to cell heterogeneity of RT genome wide, despite RIF1s enrichment in late replicating chromatin. RIF1 KO hESCs have a nearly random RT program, unlike all prior RIF1 KO cells, including HCT116, which show localized alterations. Regions that retain RT, which are prevalent in HCT116 but rare in hESCs, consist of large H3K9me3 domains revealing two independent mechanisms of RT regulation that are used to different extents in different cell types. RIF1 KO results in a striking genome wide downregulation of H3K27ac peaks and enrichment of H3K9me3 at large domains that remain late replicating, while H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 are re-distributed genome wide in a cell type specific manner. These histone modification changes coincided with global reorganization of genome compartments, transcription changes and a genome wide strengthening of TAD structures. Inducible degradation of RIF1 revealed that disruption of RT is upstream of genome compartmentalization changes. Our findings demonstrate that disruption of RT leads to widespread epigenetic mis-regulation, supporting previously speculative models in which the timing of chromatin assembly at the replication fork plays a key role in maintaining the global epigenetic state, which in turn drives genome architecture.",

We previously identified neuropeptide VF (NPVF) and the hypothalamic neurons that produce it as a sleep-promoting system (Lee et al., 2017). Here we use zebrafish to describe a neural circuit in which neuropeptide VF (npvf)-expressing neurons control sleep via the serotonergic raphe nuclei (RN), a hindbrain structure that promotes sleep in both diurnal zebrafish and nocturnal mice. Using genetic labeling and calcium imaging, we show that npvf-expressing neurons innervate and activate serotonergic RN neurons. We additionally demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of npvf-expressing neurons induces sleep in a manner that requires NPVF and is abolished when the RN are ablated or lack serotonin. Finally, genetic epistasis demonstrates that NPVF acts upstream of serotonin in the RN to maintain normal sleep levels. These findings reveal a novel hypothalamic-hindbrain circuit for sleep/wake control.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of several mesoscopic biological structures depend on the interplay of growth through the incorporation of components of different sizes laterally diffusing along the cell membrane, and loss by component turnover. In particular, a model of such an out-of-equilibrium dynamics has recently been proposed for postsynaptic scaffold domains which are key structures of neuronal synapses. It is of interest to estimate the lifetime of these mesoscopic structures, especially in the context of synapses where this time is related to memory retention. The lifetime of a structure can be very long as compared to the turnover time of its components and it can be difficult to estimate it by direct numerical simulations. Here, in the context of the model proposed for postsynaptic scaffold domains, we approximate the aggregation-turnover dynamics by a shot-noise process. This enables us to analytically compute the quasi-stationary distribution describing the sizes of the surviving structures as well as their characteristic lifetime. We show that our analytical estimate agrees with numerical simulations of a full spatial model, in a regime of parameters where a direct assessment is computationally feasible. We then use our approach to estimate the lifetime of mesoscopic structures in parameter regimes where computer simulations would be prohibitively long. For gephyrin, the scaffolding protein specific to inhibitory synapses, we estimate a lifetime longer than several months for a scaffold domain when the single gephyrin protein turnover time is about half an hour, as experimentally measured. While our focus is on postsynaptic domains, our formalism and techniques should be applicable to other biological structures that are also formed by a balance of condensation and turnover.",

    "abstract": "In the 70s a novel branch of statistics emerged focusing its effort in selecting a function in the pattern recognition problem, which fulfils a definite relationship between the quality of the approximation and its complexity. These data-driven approaches are mainly devoted to problems of estimating dependencies with limited sample sizes and comprise all the empirical out-of sample generalization approaches, e.g. cross validation (CV) approaches. Although the latter are not designed for testing competing hypothesis or comparing different models in neuroimaging, there are a number of theoretical developments within this theory which could be employed to derive a Statistical Agnostic (non-parametric) Mapping (SAM) at voxel or multi-voxel level. Moreover, SAMs could relieve i) the problem of instability in limited sample sizes when estimating the actual risk via the CV approaches, e.g. large error bars, and provide ii) an alternative way of Family-wise-error (FWE) corrected p-value maps in inferential statistics for hypothesis testing. In this sense, we propose a novel framework in neuroimaging based on concentration inequalities, which results in (i) a rigorous development for model validation with a small sample/dimension ratio, and (ii) a less-conservative procedure than FWE p-value correction, to determine the brain significance maps from the inferences made using small upper bounds of the actual risk.",

Perturbations in the density of this matrix have been associated with a number of mental disorders, including autism and depression, but its self-organization and plasticity remain poorly understood. We introduce a model based on reflected Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), a rigorously defined stochastic process, and show that it recapitulates some key features of regional serotonergic fiber densities. Specifically, we use supercomputing simulations to model fibers as FBM-paths in two-dimensional brain-like domains and demonstrate that the resultant steady state distributions approximate the fiber distributions in physical brain sections immunostained for the serotonin transporter (a marker for serotonergic axons in the adult brain). We suggest that this framework can support predictive descriptions and manipulations of the serotonergic matrix and that it can be further extended to incorporate the detailed physical properties of the fibers and their environment.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical research often involves conducting experiments on model organisms in the anticipation that the biology learnt from these experiments will transfer to the human. Yet, it is commonly the case that biology does not transfer effectively, often for unknown reasons. Despite its importance to translational research this transfer process is not currently rigorously quantified. Here, we show that transfer learning - the branch of machine learning that concerns passing information from one domain to another - can be used to efficiently map biology from mouse to man, using the bone marrow (BM) as a representative example of a complex tissue. We first trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately recognize various different cell types in mouse BM using data obtained from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) experiments. We found that this ANN, trained exclusively on mouse data, was able to identify individual human cells obtained from comparable scRNA-Seq experiments of human BM with 83% overall accuracy. However, while some human cell types were easily identified, others were not, indicating important differences in biology. To obtain a more accurate map of the human BM we then retrained the mouse ANN using scRNA-Seq data from a limited sample of human BM cells. Typically, less than 10 human cells of a given type were needed to accurately learn its representation in the updated model. In some cases, human cell identities could be inferred directly from the mouse ANN without retraining, via a process of biologically-guided zero-shot learning. These results show how machine learning can be used to reconstruct complex biology from limited data and have broad implications for biomedical research.",

In the presented study, we aimed to investigate layout symmetry-based navigation in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, in the absence of visual cues. For this purpose, we used a non-visual paradigm modeled on the Tennessee Williams setup. We also verified the inaccessibility of visual cues for tested insects using antennal positioning reflex towards looming stimulus and by testing the performance of blinded crickets. In the main experiment, we tested the crickets capacity to learn to find a cool spot positioned centrally in heated arenas of different shapes (i.e., circular, square, triangular, and asymmetric quadrilateral). We found that the symmetry of the arena significantly facilitates crickets learning to find the cool spot, indicated by the increase of time spent on the cool spot and decrease of the latency of locating it in subsequent trials. To investigate possible mechanisms utilized by crickets during the experiment, we analyzed insects approach paths to the spot. The trajectories were grouped in four distinct clusters corresponding to both heuristic and directed strategies of approaching the target, with the dominance of a semi-directed strategy (thigmotactic phase preceding direct navigation to the target). Against these results, we discuss the possibility of insects navigation by using a non-visual space representation and possible limitations of navigation capacities in such conditions in relation to multimodally-guided navigation.",

    "abstract": "Benzaldedyde, commonly detected in plant VOC (volatile organic compounds) profiling, is derived from phenylalanine. However, the last enzymatic step for benzaldedyde formation, designated as benzaldehyde synthase, remains elusive for long time. Here, we demonstrated that cinnamoyl-CoA reductases are responsible for benzaldedyde production in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). Comprehensive tissue specificity of VOC profiling revealed that benzaldehyde was specifically accumulated in root and flower of cucumber plants. VOC-gene correlation analysis suggested that several CCRs are candidate genes for benzaldehyde production: CsaCCR7 had a root-specific expression pattern while CsaCCR9 and CsaCCR18 showed a flower-specific expression pattern. Enzymatic assay demonstrated that CsaCCR7, CsaCCR9 and CsaCCR18 convert benzoyl-CoA to benzaldehyde. Subcellular localization experiments revealed that CsaCCR7 and CsaCCR18 are localized in cytosol, while CsaCCR9 was localized in peroxisome. In contrast to the long-standing view that CCR enzymes are involved in lignin biosynthesis in plants, it is the first time here to add a new biochemical role of CCR as benzaldehyde synthase in plants.\n\nHighlightsBenzaldehyde is mainly produced in flower and root of cucumber plants.\n\n14 genes encoding CCR enzyme from cucumber are comprehensively analyzed.\n\nThree CsaCCRs, function as benzaldehyde synthases, utilize benzoyl-CoA as substrate to produce benzaldehyde in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play a number of key functions in health and disease. Reactivation of astrocytes occurs in most, if not all, neurological diseases. Most current information on the mechanisms underlying astrogliosis derives from studies using rodent experimental systems, mainly because the ability to study human astrocytes under healthy and pathological conditions has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining primary human astrocytes. Here we describe robust and reliable derivation of astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Phenotypically characterized human iPSC-derived astrocytes exhibit typical traits of physiological astrocytes, including spontaneous and induced calcium transients. Moreover, human iPSC-derived astrocytes respond to stimulation with a pro-inflammatory combination of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1-alpha, and complement component C1q by undergoing changes in gene expression patterns suggesting acquisition of a reactive astrocyte phenotype. Together, these findings provide evidence suggesting that human iPSC-derived astrocytes are a suitable experimental model system to study astrocyte function and reactivation in healthy and pathological conditions of the human nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Increased use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in different applications has increased risk for adverse environmental implications based on an elevated likelihood of organism exposure. Anatase TiO2 is photoactive with exposure to ultraviolet light. TiO2 nanoparticle exposure to UV-A radiation in aquatic environments generates hydroxyl radical species, which may ultimately be responsible increased organism toxicity. The present research demonstrates that the rate of radical generation heavily depends on exposure conditions, particularly the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). Environmentally relevant concentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles were co-exposed to increasing NOM amounts (measured as concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) and UV-A intensities. Hydroxyl radical generation rate was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Radical generation rate was positively correlated to increases in TiO2 concentration and UV-A intensity, and negatively correlated to increased DOC concentration. Nanoparticle aggregation over time and decrease in light transmission from NOM had negligible contributions to the generation rate. This suggests the decreased radical generation rate is a result of radical quenching by NOM functionalities. D. magna toxicity to hydroxyl radicals is also demonstrated to decreased following the addition of DOC. These results correlate with the rate generation data, indicating that DOC provides rate attenuation that is protection to organisms. These conclusions demonstrate the importance considering exposure conditions during TiO2 toxicity testing, and during TiO2 waste management and regulatory decisions.",

    "abstract": "Cells can communicate with each other by emitting diffusible signaling molecules into the surrounding environment. However, simple diffusion is slow. Even small molecules take hours to diffuse millimeters away from their source, making it difficult for thousands of cells to coordinate their activity over millimeters, as happens routinely during development and immune response. Moreover, simple diffusion creates shallow, Gaussian-tailed concentration profiles. Attempting to move up or down such shallow gradients - to chemotax - is a difficult task for cells, as they see only small spatial and temporal concentration changes. Here, we demonstrate that cells utilizing diffusive relays, in which the presence of one type of diffusible signaling molecule triggers participation in the emission of the same type of molecule, can propagate fast-traveling diffusive waves that give rise to steep chemical gradients. Our methods are general and capture the effects of dimensionality, cell density, signaling molecule degradation, pulsed emission, and cellular chemotaxis on the diffusive wave dynamics. We show that system dimensionality - the size and shape of the extracellular medium and the distribution of the cells within it - can have a particularly dramatic effect on wave initiation and asymptotic propagation, and that these dynamics are insensitive to the details of cellular activation. As an example, we show that neutrophil swarming experiments exhibit dynamical signatures consistent with the proposed signaling motif. Interpreted in the context of these experiments, our results provide insight into the utility of signaling relays in immune response.",

Aside from its medical relevance T. brucei has also been key to the discovery of several general biological principles including GPI-anchoring, RNA-editing and trans-splicing. The parasite contains a single mitochondrial organelle with a singular genome. Recent studies have identified several molecular components of the mitochondrial genome segregation machinery (tripartite attachment complex, TAC), which connects the basal body of the flagellum to the mitochondrial DNA of T. brucei. The TAC component in closest proximity to the mitochondrial DNA is TAC102. Here we apply and compare three different approaches (proximity labeling, Immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid) to identify novel interactors of TAC102 and subsequently verify their localisation. Furthermore, we establish the direct interaction of TAC102 and p166 in the unilateral filaments of the TAC.\n\nSubject areabiochemistry, molecular biology, cellular biology",

    "abstract": "One persistent curiosity in visuomotor adaptation tasks is that participants often do not reach maximal performance. This incomplete asymptote has been explained as a consequence of obligatory computations within the implicit adaptation system, such as an equilibrium between learning and forgetting. A body of recent work has shown that in standard adaptation tasks, cognitive strategies operate alongside implicit learning. We reasoned that incomplete learning in adaptation tasks may primarily reflect a speed-accuracy trade-off on time-consuming motor planning. Across three experiments, we find evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that hastened motor planning may primarily lead to under-compensation. When an obligatory waiting period was administered before movement start, participants were able to fully counteract imposed perturbations (experiment 1). Inserting the same delay between trials - rather than during movement planning - did not induce full compensation, suggesting that the motor planning interval predicts the learning asymptote (experiment 2). In the last experiment, we asked participants to continuously report their movement intent. We show that emphasizing explicit re-aiming strategies (and concomitantly increasing planning time) also lead to complete asymptotic learning. Findings from all experiments support the hypothesis that incomplete adaptation is, in part, the result of an intrinsic speed-accuracy trade-off, perhaps related to cognitive strategies that require parametric attentional reorienting from the visual target to the goal.",

    "abstract": "Ustilago maydis is a phytopathogenic fungus responsible for corn smut disease. Although it is a very well established model organism for the study of plant-microbe interactions, its biosynthetic potential has not been totally explored. By analyzing U. maydis genome, we identified a biosynthetic gene cluster whose activation led to the production of a black melanin pigment. Single deletion mutants of the cluster genes revealed that five encoded enzymes are required for the accumulation of the black pigment, including three polyketide synthases (pks3, pks4 and pks5), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (cyp4) and a protein with similarity to versicolorin B-synthase (vbs1). Moreover, metabolic profiles of the mutants defective for pks3 and pks4 indicated that the products of these genes catalyze together the first step in the melanin biosynthetic pathway since none of the mutants accumulated any melanin or intermediate products. Mutants deleted for pks5 produced orsellinic acid (OA) and triacetic acid lactone (TAL), suggesting that both products are produced by Pks3 and Pks4. It might thus demonstrate that Pks5 plays a role in a reaction downstream of that catalyzed by Pks3 and Pks4. OA and TAL were also found in extracts of a cyp4 deletion mutant along with several heterodimers of TAL and Pks5-derived orsellinic aldehyde compounds. According to their phenotypes and the intermediate products isolated from these strains, Cyp4 and Vbs1 seem to be involved in reactions downstream of Pks5. Our findings suggest that U. maydis synthesizes a new melanin based on coumarin and pyran-2-one intermediates, while most fungal melanins are derived from 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) or L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Along with these observations, this work also provides an insight into the mechanisms of polyketide synthases in this filamentous fungus.\n\nIMPORTANCEUstilago maydis represents one of the major threats for maize plants since it is responsible for corn smut disease, which generates considerable economical losses around the world. Therefore, contributing to a better understanding of the biochemistry of defense mechanisms used by U. maydis to protect itself against harsh environments, as the synthesis of melanin, could provide improved biological tools for tackling the problem and protect the crops. In addition, the fact that this fungus synthesizes melanin in a very unique way, requiring more than one polyketide synthase for producing this secondary metabolite, gives a different perspective on the complexity of these multimodular enzymes and their evolution in the fungal kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Coding of odorous stimuli has been mostly studied using single isolated stimuli. However, a single sniff of air in a natural environment is likely to introduce airborne chemicals emitted by multiple objects into the nose. The olfactory system is therefore faced with the task of segmenting odor mixtures to identify objects in the presence of rich and often unpredictable backgrounds. The piriform cortex is thought to be the site of object recognition and scene segmentation, yet the nature of its responses to odorant mixtures is largely unknown. In this study, we asked two related questions. 1) How are mixtures represented in the piriform cortex? And 2) Can the identity of individual mixture components be read out from mixture representations in the piriform cortex? To answer these questions, we recorded single unit activity in the piriform cortex of naive mice while sequentially presenting single odorants and their mixtures. We find that a normalization model explains mixture responses well, both at the single neuron, and at the population level. Additionally, we show that mixture components can be identified from piriform cortical activity by pooling responses of a small population of neurons - in many cases a single neuron is sufficient. These results indicate that piriform cortical representations are well suited to perform figure-background segmentation without the need for learning.",

Specifically, the 5-fold cross-validation on a benchmark dataset of rice gives the sensitivity and specificity of Deep6mA as 92.96% and 95.06%, respectively, and the overall prediction accuracy is 94%. Importantly, we find that the sequences with 6mA sites share similar patterns across different species. The model trained with rice data predicts well the 6mA sites of other three species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Fragaria vesca, and Rosa chinensis, with a prediction accuracy over 90%. In addition, we find that (1) 6mA tends to occur at GAGG motifs, which means the sequence near the 6mA site may be conservative; (2) 6mA is enriched in the TATA box of the promoter, which may be the main source of its regulating downstream gene expression.",

Most flowers rely on visual and chemical signals, but some bat-pollinated plants have evolved reflective surfaces to acoustically guide echolocating bats. All known acoustic flower signals rely on the same principle of increased sonar reflectivity. Here we describe a novel mechanism through which plants can make flowers acoustically conspicuous, a principle that relies on increased absorption of the area surrounding the flower. In a bat-pollinated columnar cactus (Espostoa frutescens) we found a hairy inflorescence zone, a so called cephalium. Flowers solely emerge out of this zone. We measured the ultrasound echoes of cephalia, flowers and unspecialized column surfaces and recorded echolocation calls of approaching bats. We found that the cephalium acts as strong ultrasound absorber, attenuating the sound by -14 dB compared to other parts of the column. The absorption was highest around the echolocation call frequencies of approaching bats. Our results indicate that, instead of making flowers more reflective, plants can also evolve structures to attenuate the background echo, thereby enhancing the acoustic contrast with the target. Similar sound absorbing mechanisms may be found in other species that interact with bats across a wide range of ecological contexts.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBoth subtractive and divisive inhibition has been recorded in cortical circuits and recent findings suggest that different interneuronal populations are responsible for the different types of inhibition. This calls for the formulation and description of these inhibitory mechanisms in computational models of cortical networks. Neural mass and neural field models typically only feature subtractive inhibition. Here, we introduce how divisive inhibition can be incorporated in such models, using the Wilson-Cowan modelling formalism as an example. In addition, we show how the subtractive and divisive modulations can be combined. Including divisive inhibition in neural mass models is a crucial step in understanding its role in shaping oscillatory phenomena in cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "The preferential accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells on arteries versus veins during early development is a well-described phenomenon, but the molecular pathways underlying this polarization are not well understood. During zebrafish embryogenesis the cxcr4a receptor (mammalian CXCR4) and its ligand cxcl12b (mammalian CXCL12) are both preferentially expressed on arteries at time points consistent with the arrival and differentiation of the first vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs). We show that autocrine cxcl12b/cxcr4 activity leads to increased production of the vSMC chemoattractant ligand pdgfb by endothelial cells in vitro and increased expression of pdgfb by arteries in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrate that expression of the well-characterized blood flow-regulated transcription factor klf2a in primitive veins negatively regulates cxcr4/cxcl12 and pdgfb expression, restricting vSMC recruitment to the arterial vasculature. Together, this signaling axis leads to the differential acquisition of smooth muscle cells at sites where klf2a expression is low and both cxcr4a and pdgfb are co-expressed, i.e. arteries during early development.",
